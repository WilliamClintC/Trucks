financing when all of the following conditions apply 1 for onetime capital improvement projects and unusual equipment purchases  2 when the projects useful life or the projected service life of the equipment will exceed the term of financing  and 3 then the village has identified revenues sufficient to service the debt either from existing revenues or increased taxes or fees the village will not use debt for any recurring purpose such as current operating and infrastructure maintenance expenditures nor will the village use shortterm debt unless under exigent circumstances c the village will use the following criteria to evaluate payasyougo financing versus debt financing in funding capital improvements 1 factors that favor payasyougo financing a current revenues andor adequate fund

current revenues and fund balances are insufficient to pay project costs e a project is immediately required to meet or relieve infrastructure capacity needs and current revenues and fund balances are not sufficient to finance the project f the life of the project or asset financed is ten years or longer  3262007 debt issuance guidelines a considerations in issuing general obligation go or revenue

staff to pay debt service costs with alternative revenues b credit enhancements the village will seek credit enhancements such as letters of credit or insurance when necessary for marketing purposes or to make the financing most costeffective c debt structure guidelines 1 in general the village will maintain a debt structure under which 50 percent of the outstanding principal will be repaid within ten years 2 the term of financing final bond maturity will not exceed the expected useful life of the project or equipment financed with the debt 3 if the village plans to pay debt service
