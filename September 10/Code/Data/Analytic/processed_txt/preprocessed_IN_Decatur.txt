year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 198 and 45200   kthe number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over 1000000 cases being reported in 1990  lin his report of 10221986 the surgeon general of the united states has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn  maccording to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts  nsanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities  onumerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films  pthe findings noted in divisions b2a b2o above raise substantial governmental concerns  qsexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  ra reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein  sremoval of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial government interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters  trequiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments  uthe disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant government interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  vin the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct  wthe fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter  xthe barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases  and ythe general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter passed 432012  11102 definitions for the

authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives   statutory authorization the indiana legislature has in ic 3674 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the common council of the city does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations passed 8152017   findings of facts athe flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages passed 8152017   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands fmake federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program passed 8152017   objectives the objectives of this chapter are ato protect human life and health bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public dto minimize prolonged business interruptions eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas passed 8152017   definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter
