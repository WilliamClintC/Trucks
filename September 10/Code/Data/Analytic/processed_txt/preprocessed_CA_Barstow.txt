negative impacts for local residents local businesses and vehicular and pedestrian traffic the city council further finds and determines that the utility substructure in the public rightsofway is subject to potential adverse negative impacts as a consequence of new economic and regulatory policies that foster increased competition between various utility service providers including telephone corporations and between other service providers such as cable system operators in order to mitigate these potential adverse negative impacts the following policies are adopted 1 the city manager is directed to develop and to implement public rightsofway policies and procedures that incorporate to the extent reasonably feasible the following requirements that are intended to encourage the shared

the city that identifies the location of facilities such as underground conduits that are available for shared use and the owners of those facilities b a requirement that utility and other service providers requesting permits submit a written statement that describes in reasonable detail the efforts made to obtain from other utility service providers the right to use excess capacity within existing facilities and to thereby avoid the construction of new facilities c annual map 1 a requirement that utility and other service providers occupying the public rightsofway submit annually to the city a map which may be in a uniform electronicdata format to be specified by the city that shows the location of their respective facilities in the public rightsofway 2 notwithstanding the

encourage utility and other service providers to share excess capacity within previouslyconstructed facilities and to coordinate the construction of new facilities so as to minimize the number of excavations in the public rightsofway 2 the city manager is directed to ensure that all utility and other service providers including telephone corporations and cable system operators comply with all local design construction maintenance and safety standards that are consistent with state and federal laws and regulations and that are contained within or are related to any permit that authorizes the construction of facilities within the public rightsofway including all applicable insurance provisions 3 based upon the citys projected plans for street construction or renovation projects the

telephone corporations and other utility service providers that submit applications for permits to construct facilities after a predetermined date may be required to delay such construction until the next quarterly window that is established by the city e the city council finds and determines that the installation in the public rightsofway of numerous aboveground facilities by utility service providers including telephone corporations and other service providers may create safety hazards and adverse visual impacts consequently the public works department is authorized to impose reasonable conditions in order to mitigate those potential adverse impacts that may result whether on an individual or a cumulative basis from permitted aboveground facilities those conditions may include or relate to without limitation the following 1 prior to issuance of the requisite permits all aboveground facilities proposed to be installed by a utility service or other service provider in the public

legislature of the state has in government  and 658 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city has adopted the following floodplain management regulations b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare of the residents of the city 2 these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within floodprone or floodrelated erosion areas these regulations are designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of special flood hazard areas so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the special flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes regulations to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas   part 2007 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be

provisions of this chapter 4 prohibit the placement of any manufactured home temporary or permanent   part 2007 variance procedure a nature of variances 1 the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance 2 the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that the variance pertain to a piece of property and is not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 3 it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of ensuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b conditions for variances 1 an applicant may apply for a variance based on the following property conditions a new construction substantial improvement of property and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of sections  and  have been fully considered and at the discretion of the floodplain administrator as pertaining to subsection b4 of this section as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2 in making a determination on a variance application the floodplain administrator shall use the criteria set forth in section c2 in addition variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief the term minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 3 conditions of approval of a variance the floodplain administrator may attach such other conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 4 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 5 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such

housing development does not meet the minimum thresholds 3 the density bonus and incentive provisions do not apply to new construction on an existing property if it will result in the reduction of affordable housing units on the site instead the project only qualifies for a density bonus and incentives if it maintains the existing number and proportion of onsite affordable housing units serving low and verylow income households replacement units must also be made affordable for 55 years to the same income category or a lower category as the units to be replaced if the incomes of the former residents are unknown to the developer then onehalf of the replacement units must be affordable to very lowincome households and the other half to lowincome households f incentives 1 the number of

separate and distinct act from a decision to deny or approve the entirety of the project g discretionary approval authority retained the granting of a density bonus or incentives shall not be interpreted in and of itself to require a general plan amendment zoning change or other discretionary approval if an incentive would otherwise trigger one of these approvals when it is granted as an incentive no general plan amendment zoning change or other discretionary approval is required however if the base project without the incentive requires a general plan amendment zoning change or other discretionary approval the city retains discretion to make or not make the required findings for approval of the base project h waivers a waiver is a modification to a development standard such that construction at the increased density would be physically possible modifications to floor area ratio in an amount equivalent to the percentage density bonus utilized shall be allowable as a waiver
