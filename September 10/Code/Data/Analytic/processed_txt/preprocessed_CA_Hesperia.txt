keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of marsha walen city clerk dave reno associate planner and ralph hanson deputy city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance list and disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with

this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is

areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the

2001   variance procedure a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san bernardino county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter 5 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in   see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or chapters 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of cl c3 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 7 upon consideration of the factors of b1 and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this

design standards and guidelines while there is no specific architectural style required for residential buildings and structures in the city high quality innovative architecture is strongly encouraged the primary focus is to develop a high quality residential environment the architectural style and design of building elements should be consistent within itself and complementary with the neighborhood the building design should take advantage of the sites unique natural amenities and surroundings and consider compatibility with adjacent houses and the overall streetscape appearance human scale form and proportions are encouraged all projects that require approval of a new or revised tentative tract map or extension of time for a tentative tract map including small lot subdivisions should meet or exceed the standards of quality that have been set by surrounding development new design additions and alterations to existing homes in tracts that were subject to this article should complement the surroundings and also contribute to the improvement of the area a facades and architectural detailing 1 residential facades should be articulated to add visual interest and minimize the mass of a building by breaking up the appearance of the facade facades should help to provide a sense of human scale elements of articulation include change of wall plane door and window placement facade details moldings material changes etc and other appropriate architectural treatment 2 architectural details such as decorative moldings windows dormers chimneys balconies and railings and landscaped elements such as lattices can also add detail to a facade and are strongly encouraged 3 facade treatment and architectural detailing should be relevant to the homes architectural style and should be carried throughout the entire house with each facade and any accessory buildingstructure 4 flat blank walls particularly along the front and side elevations which are viewed from the street are strongly discouraged and should be avoided also excessive facade treatment and architectural detailing should be avoided as it can create a chaotic appearance b height and roof lines 1 the roof is one of the most important elements contributing to the sense of scale and proportion of the building depending on the height and roof line it could be the most visible architectural feature as viewed from the street height and roof lines should be consistent with the style of architecture of the house and complement qualities of neighboring residential buildings such as type slope size material and color 2 the use of expansive predominantly flat roofs with a slope of less than two in twelve is discouraged on the other hand the use of too many different roof angles or roof types on a building should also be avoided as this can create a disjointed chaotic appearance 3 additions should maintain the same floortofloor height of the original building roof lines for additions should match the original slopes and ridgelines of the roof of the primary building c front entries 1 a front entry consists of the front door and its surrounding architectural elements front entries are important as they serve as the primary focal point of a residence front entries shall be visible from the street and well illuminated 2 smaller understated entries are strongly encouraged because they help create a more human scale to a home large massive entries that are double height and appear twostory are strongly discouraged recessed entries can also add a human scale to a home and create an intimate feel and are encouraged 3 front entry doors and decorative elements such as moldings columns posts lighting and builtin benches and planters should be architecturally consistent with the style of the house 4 front porches are strongly encouraged as they provide a clear sense of entry design interest shade weather protection for the front door and help foster community interface to ensure usability a minimum porch depth of eight feet is required d doors and windows 1 the placement and relationship of doors and windows is important in creating a unified building composition wherever possible window sizes should be coordinated vertically and horizontally and window design should be consistent in terms of style and general arrangement on all building sides 2 all doors and windows should be related with the chosen architectural style windows with widely varying styles are strongly discouraged for additions all new doors and windows should match those that are on the existing buildingstructure all doors and window frames should be composed of the same material as those found on the existing building 3 for additions and remodels match the existing windows of the house double glazing is encouraged if not required by title 24 standards 4 knockers or door bells should be provided on doors entrance doors should provide viewers for safety and security 5 shutters trim and moldings on windows are encouraged proposed window mullion widths window trim or surrounds material and type should complement all existing windows mullion widths should be in scale with the windows and the building wider trim such as 1  4 and 1  6 is preferred to narrower trim such as 1  2 6 raw or clear anodized aluminum window frames are strongly discouraged 7 operable windows should have screens so they can be used for ventilation e garage doors garage doors should not dominate the streetscape multiple paneled doors windows or other architectural detailing should be used on garage doors to reduce their visual impact from the street and better fit the scale of the house any architectural detailing should be compatible with the architectural style of the house f awnings 1 awnings should be used only when compatible with the existing architectural style of the house the same type and color awnings shall be used for the entire building awning color should accent the colors on the building 2 awning frames shall be designed to withstand the minimum wind speed as required in the adopted building code 3 canvas vinyl or polyester awnings are preferred awnings shall be regularly maintained and deteriorating awnings shall be replaced promptly g dormers 1 dormers provide light and ventilation to the top floor of a building and can provide a means to increase livable area they are highly visible elements of a roof the dormer style should be consistent with the overall architectural style of the building new dormers should be designed to match those already existing on the building 2 dormers should align with or be centered between the windows found on the main body of the building 3 dormer trim work should be painted to match the main body trim dormer sidewalls should be made with the same wall materials finish and color found on the main building h chimneys 1 if chimneys are provided they should be designed to reflect the architectural style of the building and be appropriate in scale with the building chimneys should use materials and detailing compatible with those found on the building for remodels and additions new chimneys should match the scale design and materials of any existing chimneys 2 spark arresters shall be provided with all chimneys and be architecturally compatible with the building i materials and finishes 1 the choice and mix of materials on residential facades and garage doors has a significant visual impact materials and finishes should be of high quality appropriate for the style and scale of the house and consistently applied piecemeal embellishment with frequent changes in materials should be avoided 2 the use of at least one strong accent material is encouraged the number of materials and finishes should be limited to those appropriate for the style of the house each style of house calls for a different mixture of finishes for some architectural styles only one or two finishes are appropriate while others can support more too many materials are discouraged and can result in a chaotic unpleasant facade 3 for new buildings the repetition of textures and color found in the neighborhood can help tie the new building to its surroundings in remodels and additions new materials should match those of the existing buildings accessory buildingsstructures should match materials finishes and colors found on the primary building 4 architectural design and exterior materials should be applied consistently on all sides of the building to provide continuity materials tend to appear substantial and integral to the building when material changes occur at changes in plane material changes not accompanied by changes in plane appear tackedon and are strongly discouraged when using wood siding or masonry as a primary or accent material in the front extend it along the sides or at least to an inside corner do not stop at an outside corner 5 exposed gutters and downspouts should be colored to match fascia or wall materials unless designed as an outstanding architectural feature of the overall theme 6 materials that are responsive to climate adjacent context and site orientation are encouraged natural materials suitable to the high desert environment include stone brick and metals such as copper and are encouraged synthetic materials made to simulate natural wood and masonry are discouraged 7 stucco and plaster finishes should be consistent with the architectural style of the building the use of very rough knockdown stucco finishes is discouraged 8 the use of sustainable building materials is strongly encouraged this includes using quality materials with a long lifespan selecting materials that are not energyintensive to manufacture using building products made from recycled materials and repairing and maintaining wellbuilt existing buildings to the fullest extent possible j color and texture 1 for most architectural styles the number of colors on the exterior should be limited to a maximum of three with an additional contrasting color for accent in general the lighter colors should be used for the main body with darker shades for trim and accent the larger and simpler the house design the more subtle the color should be to reduce the massiveness of large wall planes 2 earth tones are best suited and are appropriate for most of the architectural designs found in the city the use of strong or bright unnatural colors including the bright whiteonwhite color schemes for exterior stucco wood siding trim doors and shutters should be avoided however the use of strongly contrasting natural colors can be appropriate for accent use such as for shutters and doors 3 details such as trim shutters posts etc should be articulated by the use of color texture or both 4 color palettes and texture palettes should be kept relatively simple so that clashes and very dramatic contrasts are avoided k roofing materials 1 roofing materials should be compatible with the architectural style and design of the building permanent roof materials such as concrete and clay tile are encouraged because of their low maintenance and consistent appearance over time metal roofing wood shake or shingle roof is acceptable 2 natural barrel clay tile roofs should be replaced with the same material for repairs remodels and additions care should be taken in the selection of material and installation to match as closely as possible the color of the aged tiles so that the finished roof does not have a patched look 3 the use of composition shingles shall be prohibited 4 the colors of natural roofing materials such as barrel tiles and slate should be left natural and not be altered by staining or painting colors of synthetic roofing materials should simulate natural materials and should be consistent with the architectural style of the house 5 roofing materials with glossy surfaces appear unnatural and are strongly discouraged exh a 81611   site design standards and guidelines the appearance of a residential property as it is viewed from the street or sidewalk is important to the overall appearance of a neighborhood how well a house fits with its site and its surrounding environment contributes to the public view of the streetscape and to the success of the project all forms of residential development including additions new accessory buildings and new homes should first take into account the site on which the building will be built and the streetscape pattern of the neighborhood in wellestablished neighborhoods it is especially important to maintain the character of the neighborhood by respecting the pattern of the streetscape new homes should be compatible with the setback proportion and sale of the houses in the neighborhood they should also be compatible with the existing onsite relationships of the surrounding neighborhood such as front facade orientation scale of front entries front porches and front yard landscaping effective site planning should reflect the natural attributes of the site while maintaining compatibility with the neighborhood a setbacks 1 while respecting the minimum front and side yard setback as established in this code a new dwellings front and side yard setbacks should generally approximate that of adjacent residences the front and side yard setback pattern on the block should be identified and respected to help unify the neighborhood 2 while some variation in setbacks can add interest and diversity to the street view particularly in subdivisions a setback that significantly differs from an established pattern may be disruptive to the character of the neighborhood b orientation dwellings should orient themselves to the street with a clearly identifiable front door and windows that face the street front windows and the front door contribute to eyes on the street which helps neighborhood security c scale mass and form 1 the scale and mass of a new dwelling should blend well with neighboring houses and not overwhelm them with disproportionate size or a design that is out of character buildings that are out of scale with the neighborhood with large blank flat surfaces and insufficient open space and mature landscaping can appear out of place and incompatible with their surroundings 2 a twostory building should not be constructed in a onestory neighborhood unless it is carefully designed to be similar in scale and mass with surrounding buildings in such instances the second story should be setback from the front of house to make the second story less visible from the street second floor balconies and small decks accented with landscaping can also reduce the visual impact of twostory buildings 3 the size mass and height of a building should also be in proportion with the size of the property it is not necessarily desirable to maximize the allowable lot coverage but to provide ample open space and setbacks and preserve the character of the neighborhood 4 architectural elements such as simple roof forms facade articulation roof breaks walls with texture materials and ornamental details and incorporation of landscaping are encouraged because they add visual interest and reduce the appearance of mass and scale 5 if allowed accessory buildingsstructures and second dwellings should have comparable massing and form as the primary residence d environmental considerations 1 a house should be designed to be sensitive to its natural surroundings and compatible with the natural slope of the land reflecting its contours grading should be minimized to follow the natural contours to the greatest extent possible a house should be sited to maximize views of the high desert environment and surrounding mountains 2 significant existing trees vegetation and any other natural site attributes should be preserved to the greatest extent possible in the design and development of the house site design that requires altering landforms and removing trees is strongly discouraged 3 a new house or addition should be designed to make best use of available sun light and shade this can be accomplished in the following ways a use windows for natural light as much as possible design windows for to promote natural cooling b use trees or roof with large overhangs to shade the house particularly over south facing windows c use patios and porches to buffer the building from heat gain d incorporate attic turbines for ventilation and energyefficient heating and air conditioning systems e locate open space in a manner to maximize use of sun and shade patterns natural drainage and existing trees and vegetation 4 maximize vegetative ground cover on the lot to absorb rainwater provide drainage to large trees on the site and reduce runoff extensive paving in the front side and rear yards is strongly discouraged consideration should be given to the reduction of landscape maintenance and water consumption when selecting landscape materials e relationship to adjacent properties 1 the visual impact of a new house andor accessory buildings on adjacent properties should be minimized taller sections of buildings should be located where they will not obstruct sunlight to adjacent gardens patios pools or rooms carefully positioning or limiting the width depth or height of proposed building elements is encouraged to preserve a neighbors privacy and view privacy issues are extremely important on flag lots where neighboring houses could abut a flag lot on four or five sides 2 new windows should be placed where they promote privacy between properties windows should be offset or staggered from neighboring windows to maintain privacy between houses clerestory windows can be placed high on a wall to allow natural light and air but no view to the adjacent property where a second story addition is planned the new windows and walls should be positioned to promote visual and sound privacy between houses 3 second floor balconies should be located to minimize the loss of privacy for neighboring properties avoid locating balconies so that they directly overlook a neighboring patio or yard 4 appropriate landscaping should be provided for privacy between neighboring properties in the rear and side yards the use trees and shrubbery is encouraged to provide screens and buffers between neighbors and to shape spaces protect and care for any existing trees in the rear or side yards 5 outdoor lighting should be positioned so that no direct light extends onto neighboring properties take care in choosing and locating outdoor lighting fixtures so that privacy is maintained between properties f additions new accessory buildings and second dwelling units 1 additions and new accessory buildingsstructures and second dwelling units should maintain the look and appearance of the existing primary buildings so that they do not appear as an addition or new building they should respect the architectural style scale and rhythm of the existing primary building building elements such as roof pitch and style building proportions exterior siding and roofing materials door and window style and materials color and texture should match the existing primary building 2 an addition should complement and balance the overall form mass and composition of the existing primary building on the property 3 additions are strongly encouraged to be located behind the house away from public view additions in the front yard are strongly discouraged 4 when building an addition efficient use of floor area is encouraged maximize floor area by combining uses of space eliminating unnecessary rooms and organizing rooms to eliminate hallways g garages 1 garages should not dominate the front elevation the visual impact of garage doors along street frontages can diminish the character of the neighborhood garages should be located and designed in one of the following ways a access the garage from the side or rear of the lot where there is a rear alley and auto access is feasible rear detached garages with alley access should be used b offset the garage behind the front facade of the house the frontage of any garage should be setback a minimum of three feet from the dwellings first story frontage c if a garage must be located closer to the street than the front facade of the house provide usable open space such as a balcony or deck above the garage with a trellis or roof along the frontage of the garage to reduce the visual impact also designing an entry porch or trellis located in front of the living area to meet the setback of the garage can improve the visual appearance from the street d provide a side entry garage locate the garage so that it faces the side of the lot rather than the fronting the street 2 recreational vehicles boats trailers etc shall not be located in view from the public rightofway they add visual clutter and detract from the appearance of the neighborhood they shall be stored inside or rear yards screened from street by fences or landscaping h driveways and walkways 1 large expanses of paving for driveways and walkways should be avoided to reduce visual impact and impervious coverage in the front yard minimizing the width of driveways where feasible is encouraged 2 driveways are encouraged to incorporate natural materials into their design with the use of stone or colored concrete the use of decomposed granite is limited to small expanses such as the center portion of a driveway 3 the walkway to the front entry should be designed at a human scale  between three to five feet in width  and not be excessively wide natural materials such as brick pavers or stone tiles and textured or stamped concrete for walkways are strongly encouraged 4 the use of asphalt for driveways and walkways is prohibited i fences walls gates and hedges 1 front yard fences and walls are strongly discouraged particularly in neighborhoods where the predominant streetscape pattern has no existing fences in the front yard this provides a quality of openness that contributes to an attractive overall streetscape in residential neighborhoods where permitted front yard fences and walls shall not dominate the streetscape or reduce compatibility of the home with adjacent residences 2 fences walls gates and hedges for privacy may be used in side and rear yards 3 the materials design height and length of the fence or wall should be compatible with the architectural style materials and overall size of the primary building landscaping should be provided adjacent to fences along street frontages to soften their appearance 4 fences and gates should be designed with simplicity to complement the house avoid ornate fences and gates which draw attention and detract from the main building 5 front yard fences and walls should provide a decreasing level of opaqueness as the height of the fence or wall increases to the maximum permitted 6 columns and other architectural features such as posts should be architecturally compatible with the primary building 7 gates should be designed to reflect the architecture of the primary building and the style and design of the fence or wall 8 hedges that are intended to provide screening and privacy should be planted so as not to encroach over the sidewalk or front property line if no sidewalk exists 9 fences and walls should be constructed with materials such as masonry metal wood or a combination thereof the use of true wrought iron is preferred to hollow metal tubing barbed wire and chain link fencing are prohibited 10 good neighbor fences fences that look equally good from both sides are encouraged in side and rear yards j exterior lighting 1 exterior lighting includes all lighting fixtures on front facades security lighting and landscape lighting adequate exterior lighting shall be provided on the front of the house to ensure neighborhood safety and security exterior lighting that accentuates architectural and landscape elements of the property is encouraged 2 recessed porches must be lit 3 light fixtures should complement the design of the house 4 photosensitive offon switches are strongly encouraged for energy conservation and safety 5 exterior lighting should be positioned so that no direct light extends into neighboring properties or public rightsofway illumination should be screened from adjacent properties cutoff luminaries should be used to prevent nighttime light pollution k house address numbers 1 address numbers should be located near the front entry door or front entry porch in a location that is visible from the street 2 address numbers shall be a minimum of four inches in height or as required by the building code the design of the numbers should be simple in shape so that they can be read easily from a distance 3 number colors should provide a strong contrast with background color address number illumination is required l utility and mechanical equipment 1 all mechanical equipment shall be screened from view utility meters transformers backflow devices and equipment should be placed in locations that are not exposed to view from the street or they should be suitably screened all screening devices should be compatible with the architecture and color of the house and should not look like a tacked on addition 2 roof mounted equipment should be avoided 3 all antennas should be placed in building attics or interiors all new units should be prewired to accommodate cable reception satellite dishes shall be located away from public view and should be considered early in the design process in terms of location and screening from view from the street and from common recreation areas exh a 81611   additional design standards and guidelines for small lot singlefamily developments small lot singlefamily developments shall be developed according to the provisions and standards of this code in addition to the aforementioned design standards and guidelines in this article the following additional standards and guidelines should be incorporated into the design of projects for small lot detached singlefamily development to create functionality and visual variety along local residential streets 1 the architectural design scale and mass of the development should blend well with the surrounding neighborhood and complement the character of the neighborhood 2 variation should be provided in unit types architectural design and building massing to provide visual interest within the development 3 where possible there should be some variation in setbacks unit placement and orientation to achieve efficient and unique site design and avoid a monotonous street scene 4 both active and passive open space and recreational amenities for private and common use by the residents shall be provided 5 decorative elements such as architectural details intensified landscaping pedestrian paths decorative lighting etc are encouraged to complement and enhance the development and create variety and interest 6 gated entries into small lot singlefamily developments are prohibited exh a 81611 article vii  multiplefamily residential design guidelines footnotes  8  editors note exh a adopted aug 16 201 amended in its entirety to read as herein set out former art vii   pertained to the limited agricultural district see the ordinance list and disposition tables for full derivation   general provisions and administration all new multiplefamily or multifamily developments constructed in the r3 designation shall provide and maintain design standards and guidelines in compliance with the provisions of this article it is the duty of the development services department to enforce all permitting and entitlement provisions of this article the director or hisher designee may impose such conditions deemed necessary to achieve the purpose of this article exh a 81611   architectural design standards and guidelines while there is no specific architectural style required for buildings in the multiplefamily residence r3 designation high quality innovative architecture is strongly encouraged the primary focus is to develop a high quality residential environment the architectural style and design of building elements should be consistent within the development and complementary with the neighborhood in terms of scale materials and color but it does not need to copy or duplicate existing buildings variation of building styles produces healthy design diversity and is encouraged new projects should meet or exceed the standards of quality that have been set by surrounding development and contribute to the improvement of the area a building articulation and detailing 1 individual units should be articulated to diminish the massing of large buildings and be compatible with the scale of surrounding development building design shall avoid large monotonous facades long straight line building fronts plain box shapes and barren exterior treatment 2 avoid designing buildings that are longer than one hundred twentyfive 125 feet facades of multifamily buildings should be divided into shorter modules a maximum of thirty 30 feet in width to give the appearance of an assemblage of smaller buildings with each of the units individually recognizable this can be accomplished use of porches balconies and architectural projections  varied unit setbacks within the same building  staggered or jogged building planes  and a mix of different unit types within the same unit cluster units can be further articulated by the rhythm and pattern of windows and doors the use of mansard roofs or segments of pitched roof applied at buildings edge is not an acceptable method to provide articulation 3 when located adjacent to lowerdensity residential zones the bulk of multifamily developments can be imposing on adjacent residential uses this necessitates that the scale of projects be considered within the context of their surroundings buildings of greater height may require additional setbacks so as not to dominate the character of the neighborhood buildings of greater mass should be separated into smaller units that better resemble singlefamily homes 4 for projects that front arterial streets the street floor building level should be raised between two and four feet to protect the privacy of ground floor units 5 distinctive architectural elements materials and colors should be used to denote primary building entries or individual unit entries 6 awnings moldings pilasters and comparable architectural embellishments are encouraged 7 the incorporation of balconies porches and patios within multifamily buildings is encouraged to break up large wall masses provide offsets between floors on multilevel buildings and add human scale to buildings 8 exterior stairways should be designed as an integral part of the architecture of a project and should incorporate solid wall portions columns andor a decorative balustrade they should be of the same materials color and detail of the building thinlooking open metal prefabricated stairs shall not be used design of railings and steps should be varied from unit to unit if possible but must maintain continuity b height and roof lines 1 roof lines should be segmented and varied within an overall horizontal context varying heights are encouraged combinations of one one and a half and twostory units create variation and visual interest and are encouraged flat roof design should be avoided 2 in some cases it may be desirable to step back the upper stories of new multifamily buildings to scale down facades that face the street common space and adjacent residential buildings 3 hipped or gabled roofs covering the entire building are preferable to mansard roofs and segments of pitched roofs applied at the buildings edge 4 the roof pitch for a porch may be slightly lower than that of the main building 5 carport roofs visible from buildings or streets should incorporate roof slope and materials to match adjacent buildings flat carport roofs are discouraged c doors and windows 1 the placement and relationship of doors and windows is important in creating a unified building composition wherever possible window sizes should be coordinated vertically and horizontally and window design should be consistent in terms of style and general arrangement on all building sides 2 all doors and windows should be related with the chosen architectural style windows with widely varying styles are strongly discouraged all doors and window frames should be composed of consistent material 3 for new multifamily developments double glazing should be used consistent with energy code requirements 4 knockers or door bells should be provided on doors entrance doors should provide viewers for safety and security 5 shutters trim and moldings on windows are encouraged proposed window mullion widths window trim or surrounds material and type should complement all existing windows mullion widths should be in scale with the windows and the building wider trim sizes such as 1  4s and 1  6s is preferred to narrower trim sizes such as 1  2s 6 raw or clear anodized aluminum window frames are strongly discouraged 7 operable windows should have screens so they can be used for ventilation d materials and finishes 1 the building and its elements should be unified by textures colors and materials materials should be consistently applied and should be chosen to work harmoniously with adjacent materials piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in materials should be avoided 2 building should be treated as a whole and finished appropriately on all sides to provide continuity materials tend to appear substantial and integral to the building when material changes occur at changes in plane material changes not accompanied by changes in plane appear tackedon and are strongly discouraged 3 exterior columns for trellises porches or colonnades should utilize materials and colors that are compatible with the adjacent building 4 exposed gutters and downspouts should be colored to match fascia or wall materials unless designed as an outstanding architectural feature of the overall theme 5 accessory and service buildingsstructures such as carports detached garages recreational buildings laundry facilities and storage buildingsstructures should be designed as an integral part of the project architecture and should be similar in material color and detail to the primary buildings 6 building materials should be high quality durable and require low maintenance 7 materials that are responsive to climate ie those suitable to the high desert environment adjacent context and site orientation are encouraged natural materials are encouraged materials such as brick stone copper etc should be left in their natural colors synthetic materials made to simulate natural wood and masonry are discouraged other suitable materials include textured concrete trowelfinish concrete metal cladding and glass curtain or glass block walls 8 stucco and plaster finishes should be consistent with the architectural style of the building a smooth trowel or fine sand float finish is desirable while the use of rough knockdown stucco finishes is discouraged 9 the use of sustainable building materials is strongly encouraged this includes using quality materials with a long lifespan selecting materials that are not energyintensive to manufacture using building products made from recycled materials and repairing and maintaining wellbuilt existing buildingsstructures to the fullest extent possible e color and texture 1 for most architectural styles the number of colors on the exterior should be limited to a maximum of three with an additional contrasting color for accent in general the lighter colors should be used for the main body with darker shades for trim and accent the larger and simpler the building design the more subtle the color should be to reduce the massiveness of large wall planes 2 earth tones are best suited and are appropriate for most of the architectural designs found in the city the use of strong or bright unnatural colors including the bright whiteonwhite color schemes for exterior stucco wood siding trim doors and shutters should be avoided however the use of strongly contrasting natural colors can be appropriate for accent use such as for shutters and doors 3 color and finishes on exterior of all elevations of a building should be coordinated to provide a total continuity of design unusual patterns and color schemes should be avoided garish nonharmonious or outofcharacter colors should not be used 4 the blending of compatible colors in a single facade or composition is a good way to add character and variety while reducing or breaking up the mass of a building lower wall wainscots and builtup or recessed reveals may be employed to add interest and break up vertical monotony 5 details such as trim shutters posts etc should be articulated by the use of color texture or both f roofing materials 1 roofing materials should be compatible with the architectural style and design of the building permanent roof materials such as concrete and clay tile are encouraged because of their low maintenance and consistent appearance over time asphalt shingle roof is not allowed 2 natural barrel clay tile roofs should be replaced with the same material for repairs remodels and additions care should be taken in the selection of material and installation to match as closely as possible the color of the aged tiles so that the finished roof does not have a patched look 3 the colors of natural roofing materials such as barrel tile and slate should be left natural and not be altered by staining or painting colors of synthetic roofing materials should simulate natural materials and should be consistent with the architectural style of the project 4 roofing materials with glossy surfaces appear unnatural and are strongly discouraged g noise impacts 1 units within the project should be adequately insulated to protect residents from noise intrusion from adjoining units in addition to insulation between common walls vertical insulation on exterior walls and from floortofloor should be provided 2 loading docks service entries mechanical equipment and recreational play areas should be sited as far away from adjoining singlefamily properties as reasonably possible 3 projects adjacent to major arterials or railroad tracks should incorporate additional noise mitigation measures to protect residents mitigation measures include but are not limited to doubleglazed windows sound walls and earth berms exh a 81611   site design standards and guidelines multiplefamily or multifamily developments are characterized by higher density residential buildings comprised of attached units and common facilities such as parking open space and recreation areas if not properly designed multifamily development can result in projects surrounded by high walls projects with monotonous blank facades or projects dominated by large parking areas with minimal landscaping and open space areas the primary goal of these guidelines is to help mitigate the effects of these situations and to provide a pleasant residential environment within multifamily developments new projects should meet or exceed the standards of quality set by surrounding development and contribute to improvement of the area a setbacks 1 while respecting the minimum front and side yard setbacks as established in residential development standards of this development code the front and side yard setbacks of a new multifamily residential development should generally approximate that of adjacent development with some variation in setbacks to provide visual interest and varying shadow patterns 2 the setback area should be used for planting landscape screens to protect the privacy of the ground floor units b building orientation siting and entrances 1 multifamily developments should have a strong street presence with public entrances oriented towards the street the majority of unit entrances must be accessed from the street or from the main open space where there is a common building entrance for all units it should be accessed from the street or main open space 2 multifamily units in large projects should be clustered or broken up into groups of buildings the use of long access balconies and corridors should be avoided access points to individual units in large projects should be clustered in groups of four or less 3 the use of distinctive architectural elements and materials to denote entrances is encouraged weather protection such as a porch covering or canopy should be provided for individual entry doors 4 new projects shall have transitional spaces in the form of stoops overhangs and porches between public areas and entrances to the units front porches are encouraged on all street front units 5 multifamily developments should be distinguished by entry and edge design features such as ornamental landscaping open space areas natural features architectural monumentation and enhanced paving 6 multifamily residential uses should be buffered from incompatible development intensified landscaping increased setbacks and appropriate building orientation should be utilized as a means of providing adequate separation between such land uses in addition where possible residential projects should utilize parking areas in addition to landscaping as a buffer along edges common with commercial or industrial uses c buildings fronting arterial streets 1 some multifamily developments within the city will be located on shallow lots along major arterial streets these streets will need to be taken into account in the project design the perceived front yard will be created by parkways and street trees together with landscaped setbacks and should be considered in providing appropriate buffer for the street facing units from traffic 2 raising the ground floor level by up to three feet can provide additional privacy and noise buffer for streetfacing ground floor units another means is to provide transitional spaces in the form of raised stoops and entry porches 3 additional landscaping with taller shrubs and groundcover in the front setbacks will also contribute to the privacy and soundbuffering objective for these units d scale and mass 1 the scale and mass of a new multifamily residential development should be consistent with neighboring developments and not overwhelm them with disproportionate size or a design that is out of character 2 larger multifamily projects should avoid massive apartmenttype buildings windows shall be provided facing the street for all units adjacent to the street to break up massing and to contribute to eyes on the street which helps neighborhood security 3 heights of individual buildings should be varied to reduce building mass by using a combination of singlelevel and twostory units as well as varying the roof pitch within a project 4 as the vertical height of a building increase it should increasingly step back from the street ie when possible the second story of a building should be set back further than the first floor 5 buildings located on properties directly adjacent to a residential and agricultural designated properties shall be designed to provide a transition between the two designations  ie the units directly adjacent to the street should be of a single story design if the adjacent residential neighborhood is developed primarily with singlestory homes e environmental considerations 1 to the extent possible site grading should relate to the natural surroundings and be designed to minimize grading by following the natural ground contours and recognizing existing drainage patterns graded slopes should be rounded to blend with existing terrain 2 multifamily developments should be designed to be sensitive to their natural surroundings and should be sited to maximize views of the high desert and surrounding mountains particularly from common and private open space areas 3 significant existing trees vegetation and any other natural site attributes should be preserved to the greatest extent possible in the projects design and development site design that requires altering land forms and removing trees is strongly discouraged 4 a new multifamily development should be designed to make best use of available sun light and shade this can be accomplished in the following ways a use windows for natural light as much as possible design windows for to promote natural cooling b use trees or roofs with large overhangs to shade the units particularly over south facing windows c use patios and porches to buffer the units from heat gain d locate private and common open space in a manner to maximize use of sun and shade patterns natural drainage and existing trees and vegetation 5 maximize vegetative ground cover on the lot to absorb rainwater provide drainage to large trees on the site and reduce runoff extensive paving is strongly discouraged consideration should be given to the reduction of landscape maintenance and water consumption when selecting landscape materials f privacy between buildings 1 buildings should be oriented to promote privacy to the greatest extent possible 2 windows balconies or similar openings above the first story should be oriented so as not to have a direct lineofsight into adjacent units within the development in addition units above the first story should be designed so that they do not look directly onto private patios or backyards of adjoining residential property or units 3 landscaping should be used to aid in privacy screening 4 outdoor lighting should be positioned so that no direct light extends onto neighboring properties g vehicle circulation and access 1 site access and internal circulation in multifamily developments

circulation should be provided throughout the site to the greatest extent possible deadend driveways should be minimized adequate areas for maneuvering stacking and emergency vehicle access should be provided 6 project entries and driveway areas should contain design features including landscaping and textured paving to break up the expanse of paving in a project paving materials should complement the architectural design the use of stamped concrete stone brick pavers exposed aggregate or color concrete is encouraged long uninterrupted broom finished concrete should be avoided the use of asphalt for driveways and walkways is prohibited 7 alley improvements should coincide with site planning to minimize alleyway deterioration and address problems such as debris safety and any nuisance odors or hazards h pedestrian circulation 1 multiplefamily developments shall include pedestrian walkways pedestrian circulation should be adequately separated from vehicular traffic pedestrian entrances and walkways should be clearly identified and easily accessible to minimize pedestrianvehicle conflict 2 pedestrian walkways should link dwelling units with common open space and recreation areas parking areas and the street at the project entries where possible multifamily developments should incorporate pedestrian connections to adjoining residential and commercial projects and other compatible land use facilities 3 pedestrian walkways should be safe visually attractive and well defined by landscaping and lights use of varied surfaces and decorative pavement is encouraged at a minimum decorative paving should be used to delineate crossings at circulation drives and parking aisles 4 curvilinear and offset paths provide a more inviting and interesting experience and are

determine a suitable location for a transit shelter onsite freestanding shelters should be integrated architecturally with the project with respect to color materials and architectural style to the extent allowed by the transit provider i parking 1 parking for multifamily developments shall be provided on site in ongrade or underground structures parking courts carports or attached garages adverse visual impacts from parking areas carports structures and garage doors on the residential character of the street or project site should be minimized siting and design 2 parking shall be located within close proximity to the building and located to the rear of the parcel wherever possible parking shall be designed to avoid awkward turning maneuvers and the backing of vehicles into public streets 3 pedestrian walkways should be safe visually attractive and well defined by landscaping and lights use of varied surfaces and decorative pavement is encouraged at a minimum decorative paving should be used to delineate crossings at circulation drives and parking aisles 4 curvilinear and offset paths provide a more inviting and interesting experience and are generally preferred over long straight alignments paths that traverse open space areas are encouraged 5 parking should not occupy more than thirty 30 percent of any linear street frontage and parking in the front setback areas is discouraged 6 except for townhome projects with attached garages all multifamily parking should be in efficient multiple stall configurations large multifamily parking areas should be divided into a series of connected smaller parking courts long runs of parking spaces are discouraged 7 parking courts should be treated as important spaces whose character is clearly defined by landscaping lighting building massing and pedestrianvehicular circulation areas parking courts should be separated from buildings by a walkway minimum four feet wide and landscape strip minimum seven feet wide 8 carport structures should be architecturally compatible with the design of the main building in the project pitched roofs for carports are strongly encouraged flat aluminum carport structures are prohibited particularly in long interrupted runs carports shall meet setback and building separation requirements 9 if tuckunder parking is provided the first floor of the residential units shall not

herein the former pertained to commercial districts and derived from      commercial design standards and guidelines a general 1 purpose this article provides standards and guidelines for designing new commercial projects in the city as well as exterior alterations and additions to existing commercial developments commercial developments are often located at prominent locations in a city and convey a strong visual image the attention paid to their design reflects a citys economic vitality as well as its pride in itself these standards and guidelines encourage the highest level of design quality and creativity and recognize the importance of quality design to the success or failure of commercial enterprises property owners developers architects building designers and contractors seeking to construct new commercial developments or alterations or additions to existing developments should use these standards and guidelines in the early design stages of their projects these standards and guidelines are not intended to limit creative site planning and architecture that are consistent with the stated goals and within the context of surrounding neighborhood patterns innovative design solutions are strongly encouraged 2 applicability these standards and guidelines apply to all new commercial development including exterior alterations and additions to existing developments they apply to smaller infill projects as well as larger master planned sites 3 design goals the design standards and guidelines have been established in order to accomplish the following goals a promote design creativity and variation while ensuring consistency in building scale proportion and pedestrian orientation b improve the quality of design for commercial developments thereby improving the image character and appearance of the commercial areas c contribute to the character of neighborhoods by respecting the scale proportion and architectural style of the surrounding area d create visual interest in commercial buildings while maintaining a sense of harmony within the project e eliminate random development patterns and establish site planning and design relationships between new development and neighboring properties f encourage environmental sensitivity in development g create attractive and functional site arrangements of buildings service and loading areas open spaces and parking areas  and develop a high quality architectural and landscape design h improve pedestrian circulation and connections on commercial sites and within commercial areas i minimize incompatible impacts of noise light traffic and visual character b architectural design standards and guidelines commercial buildings should display unique visually attractive qualities while having a unified composition new buildings or building additions and renovations should not only harmonize with the prevailing characteristics of the surrounding area but should be designed in response to individual site conditions and to enhance the overall image of the city by virtue of the quality of design and construction additions and renovation should be compatible with the existing building in scale materials and design new projects should meet or exceed the standards of quality that have been set by surrounding development and contribute to the improvement of the area all new construction should be designed to improve the reality and perception of pedestrian safety and security with elements such as easily identifiable entrances retail windows pedestrianscaled building massing and unique architectural features pedestrianoriented development is generally low to mediumscale lowintensity neighborhood serving commercial retail and office uses within or adjacent to residential neighborhoods it is strongly pedestrianoriented with a storefront emphasis on the street but also is geared towards accommodating the automobile at the other end of the spectrum are big box retail and largerscale commercial retail and office centers these are much larger in scale and intensity and typically geared towards the automobile both in location often near a freeway and in site layout large surface or structured parking these larger big box retail centers and office complexes should also provide for the pedestrian both of these types of commercial development can be found in the city therefore while the following guidelines are applicable to all commercial developments in some instances additional standards and guidelines are provided for  pedestrianoriented commercial development and  big box retail and larger scale commercial development 1 architectural style a there is no mandated architectural style required for commercial structures in the city however each project should possess an identifiable architectural theme and be of high quality design and materials innovative and imaginative architecture is encouraged new buildings or building complexes should be stylistically consistent architectural style materials colors and forms should all work together to express a single theme for remodels or additions the theme should be true to the original intent and style of the building b each new building addition or remodel should be stylistically consistent for example spanish details are consistent with stucco buildings and mission tile roofs and should not be used on a contemporary building historic detailing on otherwise contemporary style buildings is strongly discouraged such as using oversized too large or out of scale crown moldings or cornices to make a 1950s building appear mission style 2 scale mass and form a the size and mass of new structures including additions should be in relation to surrounding structures special care should be taken to achieve compatibility next to smallscale buildings  techniques should include limited size building articulation and shadow patterns b building design should employ clean simple geometric forms and coordinated massing that produce an overall sense of unity scale and interest use simple strong massing with broken and varied elements c to create visual interest where appropriate varied roof or parapet heights andor recessed or extended building walls should be used d building corners may be emphasized by use of elements such as towers domes or entries e where new buildings or additions are built immediately between existing buildings the design of the new construction should acknowledge the existing buildings use of architectural elements such as matching cornice lines continuation of a colonnade use of similar materials and similar building proportions f variable building facades along linear street frontages are encouraged variable facades create an interesting street scene nearly vertical or mansard roofs should be avoided g the appearance of building mass may be reduced use of arcades courtyards pergolas and stepping stories back above the ground level h color and material changes should be used to add interest and reduce a buildings apparent scale pedestrianoriented commercial development i buildings should have a human scale ie relate to the pedestrian user big box and largescale commercial development j the scale and mass of a new big box and large scale commercial development should be consistent with neighboring developments and not overwhelm them with disproportionate size or a design that is out of character k a single dominant building mass should be avoided by clustering several smaller structures and using variations in building form l as appropriate to the function of a building a combination of major and minor changes in building form should be incorporated to create visual interest and establish a transition to neighboring developments m primary building entries should be highlighted massing of the building greater height can be used to highlight and accentuate entries in the form of corner tower elements tall voids or a central mass sited within an entry plaza conversely smaller building masses can also communicate the location of entries 3 building modulation articulation and detailing a building design shall avoid large monotonous facades long straightline building fronts plain box shapes and barren exterior treatment where consistent with the design theme and function of the building incorporate a variety of massing elements and a combination of major and minor changes in building form to establish visual transition and unity among neighboring developments and create visual interest b use building modulation facade articulation and detailing to create an interesting and individual design for commercial centers c use building form to emphasize individual units within a building larger units andor anchor stores within retail projects and foyers lobbies and reception areas within nonretail commercial projects use building form and articulation to emphasize public entrances and deemphasize service areas and to define and shelter ie give a sense of invitation and enclosure pedestrian walks and exterior spaces d building articulation and detailing should be used to create an interesting and individual design diminish the massing of large structures and be compatible with the scale of surrounding development building design shall avoid large monotonous facades long straightline building fronts plain box shapes and barren exterior treatment all building elevations visible from a public way including freeways shall be fully articulated and incorporate the chosen design theme in a consistent manner e building articulation can also be accomplished with the placement of windows and entries volume changes variable roof forms and height significant color and material changes variable transparency and the creation of shadow textures with trellises and overhangs f appropriate building modulation and articulation creates interesting facades and makes a positive contribution to the street environment g use building form to emphasize public entrances and reduce the overall mass of nonretail commercial projects h the staggering of planes along an exterior wall elevation creates pockets of light and shadow providing relief from monotonous uninterrupted expanses of wall wall planes should not run in one continuous direction for more than fifty 50 feet without an offset i facades should reflect the quality and integrity of the underlying structure in a clear and consistent manner architectural elements that define scale and organize space are encouraged  facades should display a sense of order j buildings should incorporate architectural details and elements which will reduce building scale at the street level especially along pedestrian walkways awnings canopies arbors trellises etc are effective in this regard the appropriate use of other architectural details including reveals course lines decorative cornice columns etc is also encouraged as a means of creating interest variety and distinctive design details should reflect the structural and material integrity of the building  overly gratuitous ornamentation is discouraged k vertical architectural elements such as towers should be used as focal points gutters and downspouts should be concealed unless designed as a decorative architectural feature pedestrianoriented commercial development l retail buildings should incorporate human scale design elements that generate interest and diversity and relate the building to the everyday user the design of individual storefronts and their entrances should be emphasized m a pedestrianoriented commercial building module shall range from thirty 30 to fortyfive 45 feet and have a typical threebay modulation buildings wider than two modules 6090 feet shall have a different modulation these buildings shall either repeat the basic threebay module of thirty 30 to fortyfive 45 feet or increase the number of bays while keeping the individual bay width from ten to fifteen 15 feet buildings wider than ninety 90 feet shall be visually broken into two or more buildings each with a maximum width of ninety 90 feet in terms of the facade treatments the modules should be articulated in a manner consistent with the building style the use of pilasters is one element commonly used to achieve this articulation n the horizontal should be emphasized to create a low profile and human scale vertical elements such as towers are just one of the design tools available to accentuate the predominantly horizontal massing o smaller building bays can be articulated by color and material changes as well as variations in the wall plane big box and largescale commercial development p in largescale commercial development while the modulation of a typical storefront may be larger than that in the pedestrianoriented area design elements that generate interest and diversity and relate the building to the everyday user should still be incorporated the design of individual storefronts and their entrances should be emphasized q a typical largescale commercial building module should range from fortyfive 45 to eighty 80 feet with the articulation of the building structure at fifteen 15 to twenty 20 feet buildings wider than two modules 90160 feet shall have a different modulation these buildings shall repeat the basic module of fortyfive 45 to eighty 80 feet buildings wider that one hundred sixty 160 feet should be visually broken into two or more buildings each with a maximum width of one hundred sixty 160 feet in terms of the facade treatments to stay in scale with the rest of the block r anchor buildings for major tenants generally big boxes should be sited and designed in such a way that the buildings that accommodate the smaller tenants are not overwhelmed or crowded s arcades trellises and other open structures should be utilized to visually and physically link buildings and provide connections to adjacent sidewalks stairways should be designed as an integral part of the building architecture boldly projecting stairways that complement the architectural massing and form of commercial buildings are encouraged 4 site and building entrances a main entries to buildings should be clearly demarcated visible and accessible from the street andor pedestrian walkways secondary entries may be from parking areas b building entries should read as such and be integrated with the overall building form variation in building height wall plane roof treatment window placement architectural detailing etc should define and emphasize public entries variation in material texture andor color is also recommended as a means of identifying building entries c

nighttime skies d buildings and landscaping can be illuminated indirectly to create a strong positive image concealing light features within buildings and landscaping can highlight attractive features and avoid intrusion into neighboring properties and public rightsofway e lighting should be designed to satisfy both functional and decorative needs storefront lighting should complement the architectural style of the building f lighting designs for parking areas should take into account color rendition and glare minimization color rendition allows a person to distinguish between colors in a parking area with appropriate color rendition a person will be able to identify the color of their car color rendition will vary according to the lamp type selected and should be considered as a factor in lamp style selection during the design process glare levels should be considered and efforts should be made to minimize glare g all building entrances shall be well lit if the entrance is recessed a light from the ceiling of the entry vestibule is strongly encouraged to prevent any dark pockets or hiding places h transit stops atms and convenience stores shall be illuminated to

repealed the former  and renumbered   as   and enacted a new as set out herein the former pertained to industrial districts and derived from    industrial design standards and guidelines a general 1 purpose this standards and guidelines for designing new industrial developments and for exterior alterations and additions to existing developments because of the size and scale of industrial buildings it is especially important to consider design to ensure compatibility with other parts of the community as a category of structure types industrial buildings often present unattractive and monotonous facades with large blank wall surfaces untreated or false fronts or highly reflective and glaring surfaces in addition the site development is often not pedestrianfriendly not properly buffered from surrounding uses insufficiently landscaped and surrounded by unsightly fencing there is however a variety of design techniques that can be utilized to help overcome these situations and to direct development into a cohesive design statement that is both functional and aesthetically appealing property owners developers architects building designers and contractors seeking to construct new industrial developments or alterations or additions to existing developments should use these standards and guidelines in the early design stages of their projects these standards and guidelines are not intended to limit creative site planning and architecture that are consistent with the stated goals and within the context of surrounding neighborhood patterns innovative design solutions are strongly encouraged refer to of this development code for specific development standards pertaining to industrial uses 2 applicability these design standards and guidelines apply to all new industrial development and business parks including exterior alterations and additions to existing developments within the city the standards and guidelines apply to smaller infill projects as well as larger master planned sites and are in addition to the development standards set forth in of this development code 3 design goals the design standards and guidelines have been established in order to accomplish the following goals a improve the quality of design for industrial developments thereby improving the image and appearance of the citys industrial areas b create attractive and functional site arrangements of buildings service and loading areas open spaces and parking areas  and develop a high quality architectural and landscape design c contribute to the character of the neighborhood by respecting the scale proportion and architectural style of the surrounding area d create visual interest in industrial buildings while maintaining a sense of harmony within the project e mitigate the negative impacts and views associated with industrial uses site placement screening and buffering techniques f eliminate random development patterns and establish site planning and design relationships between new development and neighboring properties g encourage environmental sensitivity in development h improve pedestrian circulation and connections on industrial sites and within industrial areas i improve the appearance and character of the city b architectural design standards and guidelines while there is no mandated architectural style required for industrial structures in the city each project should possess an identifiable architectural theme and be of high quality design and materials industrial buildings should display unique visually attractive qualities while having a unified composition multibuilding projects should also use a consistent architectural style industrial projects should give neighboring development a sense of unity building scale and massing yet visual interest should be created with the use of a variety of architectural styles and individual building details to avoid monotonous industrial neighborhoods and enliven the publics experience of the building new projects should meet or exceed the standards of quality that have been set by surrounding development and contribute to the improvement of the area 1 building articulation and detailing a building articulation and detailing should be used to create an interesting and individual design diminish the massing of large structures and be compatible with the scale of surrounding development building design shall avoid large monotonous facades long straightline building fronts plain box shapes and barren exterior treatment b all elevations should be architecturally treated however facades visible from major street corridors should be especially attractive and shall be fully articulated and incorporate the chosen architectural theme in a consistent manner c articulation should include change of wall plane door and window treatment facade details and other appropriate architectural treatment a combination of compatible treatments should be used to create interest and variety with attention given to treating particular architectural features in a balanced yet uniquely detailed and decorative manner d the staggering of planes along an exterior wall elevation creates pockets of light and shadow providing relief from monotonous uninterrupted expanses of wall wall planes should not run in one continuous direction for more than sixty 60 feet without an offset e facades having a recognizable base and top are encouraged the base should visually relate to the proportion and scale of the building techniques for establishing a base may include richly textured materials eg tile or masonry treatments darker colored materials mullion panels reveals andor enriched landscaping tops take advantage of the visual prominence of a buildings silhouette techniques for clearly expressing a top may include cornice treatments roof overhangs with brackets richly textured materials eg tile masonry or fluted concrete andor differently colored materials colored stripes are not acceptable as the only treatment f buildings should incorporate architectural details and elements which will reduce building scale at the street level especially along pedestrian walkways awnings canopies arbors trellises etc are effective in this regard the appropriate use of other architectural details including reveals course lines decorative cornice columns etc is also encouraged as a means of creating interest variety and distinctive design details should reflect the structural and material integrity of the building  overly gratuitous ornamentation is discouraged 2 height and roof lines a the roof design should be considered as a component of the overall architectural design theme b roof forms should be simple avoid a massive appearance and reflect the internal organization of buildings c roof form and height should be varied to complement building mass and articulation vertical variations to the roof line should incorporate roof projections to avoid a false frontunfinished appearance d the roof line at the top of the structure should not run in a continuous plane for more than sixty 60 feet without offsetting or jogging the roof plane 3 doors and windows a doors and windows are key elements of any structures form and should relate to the scale of the elevation on which they appear windows and doors can establish character by their rhythm and variety and help to provide depth and contrast on elevation planes windows and doors should be used to help mitigate building mass establish scale give expression to otherwise blank walls and create a distinctive building design b all doors and windows should be related with the chosen architectural style windows with widely varying styles are strongly discouraged all doors and window frames should be composed of consistent material wherever possible window sizes should be coordinated vertically and horizontally and window design should be consistent in terms of style and general arrangement on all building sides c window exposure should be maximized along pedestrian walkways the use of opaque glass adjacent to pedestrian walkways is discouraged d window frames should appear substantial and should not be flush with the exterior finish windows should be designed to enhance building interest and articulation recessed windows or inset glazing are possible design considerations e windows located on the sides and rear of the project should also be consistent with the look and style on the front of the project 4 materials and finishes a materials and finishes should be suitable to the scale character and design theme of the building and further lend variety and interest to the project b the building and its elements should be unified by textures colors and materials materials should be consistently applied and should be chosen to work harmoniously with adjacent materials piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in materials should be avoided c buildings should be treated as a whole and finished appropriately on all sides to provide continuity materials tend to appear substantial and integral to the structure when material changes occur at changes in plane material changes not accompanied by changes in plane appear tackedon and are strongly discouraged material changes should not occur at external corners material changes may occur at reverse or interior comers or as a return at least four feet from external corners with extended returns provided for large buildings d exterior materials for industrial developments should be of high quality and low maintenance recommended materials include masonry concrete sandblasted concrete textured block brick granite marble glass painted metal elements and similar materials materials and detailing should have a substantial and longlasting appearance metal siding should be avoided as the primary material but may be used as an accent material if it is high quality and properly applied concrete blocks should also be avoided unless mitigated decorative design texture and reveals e roofing materials should be durable where visible from the street acceptable roofing materials include metal standing seam and concrete tile corrugated metal standing rib metal roofs are permitted highly reflective surfaces and illuminated roofing are not permitted f materials that will withstand abuse by vandals or accidental damage from machinery are strongly encouraged while high maintenance materials such as stained wood or shingles are not encouraged g accessory structures should be designed as an integral part of the project architecture and should be similar in material color and detail to the primary buildings h the use of sustainable building materials is strongly encouraged this includes using quality materials with a long life span selecting materials that are not energyintensive to manufacture using building products made from recycled materials and repairing and maintaining wellbuilt existing structures to the fullest extent possible 5 color and texture a for most architectural styles the number of colors on the exterior should be limited to a maximum of three with an additional contrasting color for accent in general the lighter colors should be used for the main body with darker shades for trim and accent the larger and simpler the building design the subtler the color should be to reduce the massiveness of large wall planes b offwhites light grays and muted earth tones are best suited and are appropriate for industrial developments the use of strong or bright unnatural colors including the bright whiteonwhite color schemes however a greater variety of brighter more intense colors are permitted to highlight architectural features such as awnings canopies doorways window framing and trim reveals etc c color and finishes on exteriors of all elevations of a building should be coordinated to provide a total continuity of design unusual patterns and color schemes should be avoided garish nonharmonious or outofcharacter colors should not be used d the blending of compatible colors in a single facade or composition is a good way to add character and variety while reducing or breaking up the mass of a building lower wall wainscots and builtup or recessed reveals may be employed to add interest and break up vertical monotony  exh a 2712    site design standards and guidelines a industrial site design must be functional and efficient as well as compatible with adjacent land uses and aesthetically appealing elements of sound industrial site design include emphasis on the main building entry and landscaping  provision of pedestrian walkways and connections  plazas and landscaped open space areas for employees  convenient and controlled access visitor parking and onsite circulation  screening of outdoor storage and loading areas  and appropriate buffering between incompatible land uses it is also important to consider a projects relationship to adjacent industrial properties in creating a unified development pattern for the surrounding area 1 setbacks a while respecting the minimum setbacks established in commercial and industrial development standards of this development code the front and street side setbacks of new industrial development should generally approximate that of adjacent properties to establish a consistent image along the street some variation however should be provided in building and parking setbacks to avoid long monotonous building facades and provide visual interest b building setbacks should be proportionate to the scale of the structure larger structures require more setback area for a balance of scale and so as not to impose on neighboring uses c front and street side setback areas shall be landscaped d building setbacks shall be increased when adjacent to residentially designated properties to mitigate negative impacts due to noise vibration light and glare and aesthetics where an industrial project abuts a residentially designated property a minimum of ten feet of the required setback shall be devoted entirely to shrubs and trees at least six feet in height exclusive of any planter area curb e where the parking area of an industrial project abuts another industrially or commercially designated property a minimum threefoot wide perimeter landscape buffer exclusive of the planter area curb is required where feasible to do so integrate the landscape buffer with that of the adjacent property 2 building orientation siting and entrances a buildings in an industrial development should be arranged to create a sense of unity and overall harmony avoid random and irregular building relationships b site development including location of building parking and landscape areas should consider compatible development patterns among neighboring properties in addition consideration should be given to how future neighboring developments based on existing lot patterns could relate to the project as far as is feasible a project should be designed to functionally integrate with adjacent properties by providing for reciprocal access easements common drives and common perimeter landscape planters c lot assembly is encouraged as it provides greater opportunity to create efficient master planned projects in conformance with the intent of the design guidelines d industrial buildings should have a positive street presence and contribute to an attractive street scene by orienting buildings toward the primary street frontage public entrances and administrativeoffice areas should front the street primary entries should be clearly distinguished from secondary and service entries projects with few employees should attempt to place entries and the most active areas near the street to avoid long unguarded walkways e entry and edge design features such as landscaping architectural signage and monumentation and enhanced paving should be incorporated in the project special materials color detailing or equivalent architectural treatment should be incorporated into the building design at major entries f buildings shall be sited so as to screen loading and storage areas from public view where industrial uses are adjacent to nonindustrial uses appropriate buffering techniques such as increased setbacks screening and landscaping shall be provided to mitigate any negative effects of industrial operations g building entries should read as such and be integrated with the overall building form doors should be designed at human scale variation in building height wall plane roof treatment window placement architectural detailing etc will define and emphasize public entries variation in material texture andor color is also recommended as a means of identifying building entries 3 scale and mass a the scale and mass of a new industrial development should be consistent with neighboring developments and not overwhelm them with disproportionate size or a design that is out of character b a single dominant building mass should be avoided by using variations in massing and building form c as appropriate to the function of a building a combination of major and minor changes in building form should be incorporated to create visual interest and establish a transition to neighboring developments changes in building form should be used to emphasize office space and reception areas within industrial projects emphasize public entrances and deemphasize service areas and define and shelter pedestrian walks and exterior spaces d primary building entries should be highlighted massing of the building greater height can be used to highlight and accentuate entries in the form of corner tower elements tall voids or a central mass meeting an entry plaza conversely smaller building masses can also communicate the location of entries e typically horizontal masses for building elevations less than seven hundred 700 lineal feet shall not exceed a height to width ratio of  without a substantial architectural element that projects up or away from the building such as towers bays lattices or other architectural features buildings greater than seven hundred 700 lineal feet shall not exceed a height to width ratio of  without massing variations the extent of massing breaks and building projections should relate visually to the overall scale of the building 4 plazas and open space a plazas and similar open space features are strongly encouraged as a site amenity and design detail buildings should be arranged to include opportunities for plazas patios open space areas and employee gathering spaces with amenities such as outdoor seating landscaping water elements pergolas special lighting and other placemaking features these outdoor spaces should be functional and pleasant and should not appear as leftover spaces b plazas are encouraged where high levels of pedestrian activity are expected such as adjacent to major entrances and food services or between building clusters in an industrialbusiness park development c building entries and windows should look onto plazas and open space areas to enhance activity and security d outdoor employee break areas and lunch areas should be located away from loading areas or other hightraffic areas 5 environmental considerations a to the extent possible site grading should relate to the natural surroundings and be designed to minimize grading by following the natural ground contours and recognizing existing drainage patterns graded slopes should be rounded to blend with existing terrain b significant existing trees vegetation and any other natural site attributes should be preserved to the greatest extent possible in the design and development of the industrial project site design that requires altering landforms and removing trees is discouraged c buildings should be designed and sited to maximize the use of sunlight and shade for energy savings and respect the solar access of adjacent buildings d consideration should be given to the reduction of landscape maintenance and water consumption when selecting landscape materials

points are provided d vehicular access drives and circulation routes shall be designed so that all movements involved in loading parking or turning shall occur onsite and not within the public rightofway e where a property abuts an alleyway service and vehicular access should be taken off of the alleyway this is most strongly encouraged for development on narrow lots less than one hundred 100 feet in width where these properties exclusively use the alleyway for service and vehicular access a consistent and uninterrupted building frontage can be established for the entire length of the street alley improvements should coincide with site planning to minimize alleyway deterioration and address problems such as debris safety and any nuisance odors or hazards f design provisions which allow for present or future reciprocal access with adjacent properties are encouraged 7 pedestrian circulation a industrial developments shall incorporate pedestrian walkways into site design to provide pedestrian connections from building entries to public sidewalks plazas parking areas and adjacent developments and to buffer pedestrians from vehicular movement project entries and driveway areas should contain design features including landscaping and textured paving to break up the expanse of paving in a project paving materials should complement the architectural design the use of stamped concrete stone brick pavers exposed aggregate or color concrete is encouraged b pedestrian walkways should be a minimum of four feet in width pedestrian walkways should be safe and clearly identifiable using varied surfaces decorative paving and landscaping to minimize pedestrianvehicle conflict at a minimum varied surfaces should be used to delineate crossings at circulation drives and parking aisles 8 parking a the industrial site should be a selfcontained development capable of accommodating its own parking needs the use of the public street for parking and staging of trucks is not allowed b parking areas should be accessed from the street so that circulation to parking areas does not interfere with other site activities visitor parking should be located at the front and sides of buildings to be near primary building entrances c parking areas shall be designed to avoid awkward turning maneuvers and the backing of vehicles into public streets d parking areas should not visually dominate the site large expansive paved areas located between the street and the building should be avoided in favor of smaller multiple lots separated by landscaping and buildings e the

development code c overhead rollup doors shall not be directly open to public view and shall be substantially screened from the street the freeway and residentially designated properties screening may be accomplished in a variety of ways including the use of wing walls the recessing of overhead doors building articulation landscaping or a combination of these techniques fixed hardware for roll up doors shall be located on the inside of buildings to minimize visual clutter d if located adjacent to residential areas the design of overhead doors should minimize noise such as rubber seals andor other dampening features e the grade of loading docks should be as low as feasible to minimize views from the street and the need for tall walls or fencing building segments above loading doors visible from the street and surrounding properties should conform with other guidelines pertaining to building features materials and finishes 10 outdoor storage and service areas a outdoor storage

should be incorporated as an integral part of the project design in order to enhance the overall quality and aesthetics of a site to provide attractive open space vistas and to preserve the natural character of the area exh a  5 1996   supplemental review guidelines these hillside development guidelines are intended to facilitate the appropriate development of hillside areas these guidelines are not intended to be strict standards but rather to provide direction to encourage development which is sensitive to the unique characteristics common to hillside properties their purpose is not to restrict an individual from proposing an innovative or alternative method of design in a hillside area  innovation is in fact encouraged as long as the end result is one which respects the hillside and is consistent with the purposes expressed in this chapter and in the goals and objectives of the general plan a site design 1 design of building sites should be located to the natural terrain structures should be located in such a way as to minimize necessary grading and to preserve natural features such as prominent knolls or ridgelines 2 preserve views of significant visual features as seen from both within and outside a hillside development when designing lots and plotting homes the following provisions should be taken into consideration a homes constructed along ridgelines shall be designed to be compatible with the general gradient of the existing landform the developer should avoid architectural styles that over emphasize vertical surfaces and disrupt the natural silhouette of the ridge b homes should be oriented to allow view opportunities although such views may be limited  however residential privacy should not be unreasonably sacrificed c homes should be located in a manner that will retain outward views from each unit and preserve or enhance vistas particularly those seen from public places d any significant public vista or view corridor as seen from a secondary collector or major arterial should be protected 3 significant visual features such as large rock formations or groupings of protected plants or trees shall be given special consideration in the design of the subdivision disturbance of such areas shall be avoided unless in conflict with construction safety requirements or fire prevention standards b walls and fences walls and fences can be used to define a sense of place and create an attractive appearance however walls should not dominate a view and their height should be limited adjacent to a street or trail or within a rear yard terracing and extensive landscaping can reduce the effective bulk in addition street front walls should incorporate varying design and natural materials the use of open view fencing is encouraged so long as adequate public safety and residential privacy are maintained 1 retaining walls used to create pads or yard areas shall be minimized where possible the structure shall be located to conceal the wall and cut slope where retaining wall or fences are adjacent to roads or are visible from public areas they shall be built where feasible of natural materials indigenous to the area nonnative materials designed and colored to blend in with the surrounding area may be substituted 2 introduction of landscaping within hillside areas should make maximum use of texture color be capable of blending in with the natural landscape and help soften the effects of buildings walls pavement and grading 3 retaining walls or other support structures should be designed to minimize their visual impact such as terracing crib walls and appropriate landscaping 4 where retaining structures are required for hillside roads efforts should be made to integrate them with the foundation walls of the adjacent residence and natural materials should be used in conjunction c driveways and roadways 1 roadways should conform to the natural landform they should not greatly alter the physical and visual character of a hillside by creating large notches in ridgelines or by defining wide straight alignments reduced road sections split sections and parking bays should be considered in the layout of hillside streets to reduce grading 2 local road and driveway alignments shall be designed to conform to existing topography and to minimize grading road grades shall be kept as flat as possible roads exceeding ten percent and driveway grades exceeding fourteen 14 percent require design to the satisfaction of the city engineer collector and larger roads shall have grade limits reviewed on a case by case basis 3 driveways shall be designed to provide for approved fire access lanes to any structure more than one hundred fifty 150 feet from a public street access roads shall be a minimum of twelve 12 feet in width and have a vertical clearance of thirteen 13 feet six inches the maximum grade shall be twelve 12 percent for asphalt and fifteen 15 percent for concrete all cases exceeding these standards shall be reviewed on a case by case basis by the fire chief in accordance with the fire protection standards of the hesperia fire protection district d grading 1 contour grading techniques should be used to provide a variety of both slope percentage and slope direction in a three dimensional undulating pattern similar to existing adjacent terrain the following concepts should be utilized a hard edges left by cut and fill operations should be given a rounded appearance that closely resembles the natural contours of the land b manufactured slopes adjacent to roadways should be modulated by sufficient berming regrading and landscaping to create visually interesting and pleasing streetscapes c where cut or fill conditions are created slopes should be varied rather than left at a constant angle which may be unstable or create an unnatural rigid engineered appearance portions of the graded slope may exceed the maximum allowed within the slope class in order to achieve this objective d the angle of any graded slope should be gradually adjusted to the angle of the natural terrain e when adjacent pad elevations exceed ten feet and terrace grading techniques are used the pad configuration should be softened with variable undulating slopes created to give a more pleasing and natural appearance exh a  6 1996 surface mining and reclamation purpose and intent a the city recognizes that the extraction of minerals is essential to the continued economic wellbeing of the city and to the needs of society and that the reclamation of mined lands is necessary to prevent or minimize adverse effects on the environment and to protect the public health and safety the city also recognizes that surface mining takes place in diverse areas where the geologic topographic climatic biological and social conditions are significantly different and that reclamation operations and the specifications therefore may vary accordingly b the purpose and intent of this chapter is to ensure the continued availability of important mineral resources while regulating surface mining operations as required by californias surface mining and reclamation act of 1975 public resources et seq as amended hereinafter referred to as smara public resources prc relating to annual reporting requirements and state mining and geology board regulations hereinafter referred to as state
