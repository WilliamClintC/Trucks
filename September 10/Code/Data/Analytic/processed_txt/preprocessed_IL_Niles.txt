shown on the official zoning map as being included within a district is classified as the r1 singlefamily residential district b interpretation of boundary lines  1 rightofway lines where zoning district boundary lines coincide with rightsofway the boundary line is construed to be the centerline of the rightofway 2 property lines where zoning district boundary lines coincide with a recorded property line the property line is construed to be the boundary line of the district 3 scaled lines where the district boundary lines do not coincide with a rightofway line or recorded property line the district boundary is determined by measuring such boundary lines using the map scale as provided on the official zoning map 4 clarification of boundary lines where the application of paragraphs 1 above leaves doubt as to the boundary between two zoning districts the director of community development will decide any interpretations of zoning district boundary lines decisions of the director of

along interior side and rear yards in the following cases 1 where an r3 or r4 district abuts a r1 r2 or r235 district this does not apply to singlefamily and twofamily dwellings located within an r3 or r4 district 2 where a nonresidential use is located within a residential district this does not apply to parks 3 where a nonresidential district abuts a residential district this does not apply to parks b buffer yards may be located within required yards but must be reserved for the planting of material and installation of screening as required by this section no parking driveways sidewalks accessory structures or other impervious surfaces are permitted within the buffer yard area c the required design of buffer yards is as follows 1 a buffer yard must be a minimum of 10 feet in width this requirement may be reduced or eliminated for smaller parcels by the director of community development if it is demonstrated that a 10 foot wide buffer yard presents a hardship 2 one shade tree

of trees planted must be no less than one per 25 linear feet of buffer yard length 3 existing trees that are preserved may count toward the buffer yard tree requirement this credit is a  ratio one existing tree for one proposed tree regardless of the size of the existing tree 4 unless otherwise specifically required by the use standards of this a solid fence or wall of six feet in height must

note for example new commercial construction next to an existing residential district must provide the buffer yard conversely new residential construction next to an existing commercial district is not required to provide a buffer yard and is not considered nonconforming 1110  stormwater management basin landscaping storm water management basins must be designed as an integral part of the overall site plan and should provide required storm water storage as well as desirable environmental functions and an aesthetically pleasing environment a storm water management basins should be designed as follows 1 in permanently wet retention basins emergent plantings must be incorporated to soften the shoreline increase water quality and provide wildlife habitat the shoreline zone consisting of an area from the normal water level to the top of the slope around the entire perimeter must be planted with suitable cover vegetation such as native grasses sedges forbs or turf a maintained turf areas may be used within the shoreline zone to allow vehicle access for maintenance including but not limited to dredging equipment maintained turf must not constitute more than 30% of the area of the shoreline zone 2 in drybottom or occasionally inundated detention basins all areas of the basin including the floor side slopes berms impoundment structures or other earth structures must be planted with turf grass or other cover vegetation specifically suited for storm water basins turf grass areas must be sodded or hydroseeded to minimize erosion during the establishment period and once established should be maintained at a height of not more than six inches wildflowers meadow plantings and nonaggressive grasses suitable to the intermittently wet conditions of the detention basin are encouraged as alternatives to turf grass provided that they provide continuous cover to all areas of the basin and do not interfere in the safe and efficient function of the basin 3 storm water management basins are required to provide a buffer zone extending 20 feet from the top of slope around the entire perimeter of the basin this area serves to buffer adjacent uses and to provide a transition to a developments overall landscape theme required plantings in the buffer zone may be grouped together or spaced as necessary to provide an aesthetically appealing transition to the surrounding landscape plantings in the buffer zone are required as follows a a minimum of one deciduous tree is required for each 2500 square feet of total buffer area b a minimum of one evergreen tree is required for each 3000 square feet of total buffer area c a combination of deciduous and evergreen shrubs are required at a minimum rate of one shrub for each 400 square feet of total buffer area d the remainder of the buffer area must be planted with live groundcover perennials or ornamental grasses e in the case that any of the above calculations result in a fraction it must be rounded up to the nearest whole number 4 basins must incorporate curvilinear features to blend with and complement the natural surrounding topography the use of sharp geometric shapes must be avoided 5 where appropriate dry bottom or occasionally inundated storm water management basins should be designed to serve a secondary purpose for recreation open space or other types of uses that will not be adversely affected by occasional or intermittent flooding 6 amenities such as bike paths sidewalks gazebos benches and other such items are encouraged around storm water management basins 7 all storm water management basins that can be expected to flood to a depth of three feet must have warning signs posted on all sides b maintenance should be considered at the time of designing a stormwater management basin to make maintenance easier and less costly designs should include the following features where applicable 1 a discharge drain made of concrete or other durable materials other than corrugated metal 2 a discharge drain located in the embankment with easy access for repair and debris removal 3 shoreline protection measures to prevent erosion from any potential wave action 4 facilities to allow the water level to be lowered by gravity flow for cleaning purposes and shoreline maintenance 5 plant selections that consider the climate and other events likely to contribute to

architecture landscape architecture and site amenities beyond that which would be possible though the strict application of the niles zoning niles subdivision regulations in particular the planned unit development technique is intended to encourage and allow more creative and flexible development of land than is possible under district zoning regulations and should only be applied to further those applications that provide compensating amenities to the village the underlying district dimensional and use regulations apply to a pud unless specifically modified approval process through the flexibility of the planned unit development technique the planned unit development is intended achieve some or all of the following objectives a allow for the creation of projects with a variety of land uses to be developed as a unified project b ensure that developments meet the intent purpose and policies of the village of niles comprehensive plan c encourage innovation and creativity in the land planning and design process d preserve natural site amenities and features such as vegetation topography geologic features environmentally sensitive areas access to public lands and other unique features of the site e encourage the availability of recreational opportunities and the preservation of open space f prevent and control soil erosion and surface flooding g create a method for the preservation of common open space for the continued use and enjoyment of residents within the development as well as villagewide h provide for the efficient location of institutions and public buildings and facilities i provide a process that encourages the innovative reuse andor redevelopment of older underperforming properties j encourage flexibility in the development of land and in the
