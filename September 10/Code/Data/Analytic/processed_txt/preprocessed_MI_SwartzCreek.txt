vertical road curvature or presence of structures or desired trees that limit visibility of a sign on the premises compared to similar sites with conforming signs in the same zoning district  or 2 a variance is warranted due to the relatively large size of the site frontage or building in comparison to other establishments in the same zoning district  or 3 a variance would significantly improve the conformity of an existing sign b to grant a variance for one of the conditions specified above all of the following standards must also be met 1 the inability to conform with the requirements of this article is due to a hardship or practical difficulty that includes more than mere inconvenience or mere inability to attain a supposed higher financial return  and 2 that the alleged hardships or practical difficulties or both are exceptional and peculiar to the property of the person who requested the variance and result from conditions which do not exist generally throughout the city  and 3

and purpose the intent of this article is to establish the procedures and consistent standards for review and approval of site plans to ensure full compliance with the regulations in this ordinance and other applicable ordinances and state and federal regulations of development proposals site plan review standards are intended to encourage consultation and cooperation between the applicant and the city to balance the property owners right to a reasonable rate of return on investment with the citys overall land use goals and desire to minimize adverse impacts on the investments of surrounding landowners therefore these site plan review standards insure a thorough evaluation of a development in relation to the goals of the city of swartz creek master plan and the potential impacts on the environment drainage utilities traffic aesthetics property values and other public health safety and welfare issues this section also contains special provisions to evaluate impacts of particular uses and to allow administrative approval in certain cases where there is a change in use a minor change to an existing site or a minor change determined necessary in the field during construction relationship to platting and land divisions or combinations the city council shall require the platting of parcels of property andor the approval of land divisions or land combinations

submitted for minor modifications to a legally existing and conforming use and building which is permitted in the zoning district ie special land uses are not eligible including alterations to a building or site that do not result in expansion or substantially affect the character or intensity of the use vehicular or pedestrian circulation drainage patterns the demand for public infrastructure or services significant environmental impacts or increased potential for hazards c administrative review certain smaller scale projects and expansions or changes in use to existing sites which are required to provide a limited site plan do not require review by the planning commission  but instead shall undergo a formal review for approval by the zoning administrator d exempt

facilities and wireless communication support structures a a wireless communication support structure must be established within a rightofway having an existing width of more than 204 feet b a wireless communication support structure must be established on municipallyowned property c purpose and intent it is the general purpose and intent of the city of swartz creek to carry out the will of the united states congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems however it is the further purpose and intent of the city to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large in fashioning and administering the provisions of this section attempts have been made to balance these potentially competing interests recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless communication services and coverage it is the further the purpose and intent of this section to 1 facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless communication facilities 2 establish in predetermined districts the number shape and location considered best for the establishment of wireless communication facilities subject to applicable standards and conditions 3 recognize that operation of a wireless communication system may require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined districts or zones in such cases it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the community consequently more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review approval and use of such facilities 4 ensure that wireless communication facilities are situated in appropriate municipallyowned locations and relationships to other land uses structures and buildings 5 limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impact upon existing population transportation systems and other public services and facility needs 6 promote the public health safety and welfare 7 provide for adequate information about plans for wireless communication facilities in order to permit the community to effectively plan for the location of such facilities 8 minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities including a requirement to remove unused andor unnecessary facilities in a timely manner 9 minimize the negative visual impact of wireless communication facilities on neighborhoods community land marks historic sites and buildings natural beauty areas and public rightsofway this contemplates the establishment of as few structures as reasonably feasible and the use of structures which are designed for compatibility including the use of existing structures and the avoidance of lattice structures that are unnecessary taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this section 10 city council finds that the presence of numerous tower structures particularly if located within residential areas would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the community this in turn would have an adverse impact upon property values therefore it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall tower structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public health safety and welfare d authorization 1 subject to the standards and conditions set forth in subparagraph e below wireless communication facilities shall be permitted uses in the following circumstances

policy it is the policy of the city to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures within the community and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facility purposes consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set forth in paragraph c of this section above each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must by law be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the united states congress however particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the city that all users should colocate on attached wireless communication facility and wireless communication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section as stated above and as stated in paragraph c of this section if a provider fails or refuses to permit colocation on a facilityowned or otherwise controlled by it where colocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy intent and purpose of the city the provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with this policy 2 feasibility of colocation colocation shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section where all of the following are met a the wireless communication provider entity under consideration for colocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation for colocation b the site on which colocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility is able to provide structural support c the colocation being considered is technologically reasonable eg the colocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure antennas and the like d the height of the structure necessary for colocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the city taking into consideration the several standards contained in parts e of this section above 3 requirements for colocation a a special land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible colocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs b all new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate colocation c the policy of the community is for colocation thus if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible colocation such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect d if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible colocation and this requires the construction andor use of a new facility the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible colocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy intent and purpose of the city and consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communication support structure within the city for a period of five years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the colocation such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning
