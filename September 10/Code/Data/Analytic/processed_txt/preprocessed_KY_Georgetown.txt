612 secs 858860 reserved division 6 appeals and variance procedures nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the article are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the fiscal court of scott county the city council of georgetown and the city commissions of sadieville and stamping ground to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate art 6  1 1614 designation of variance and appeal board the boards of adjustment for scott county and the cities of georgetown sadieville and stamping ground are hereby established as appeal boards the property location will determine the appropriate board to hear the appeal art 6  2 1614 duties of variance and appeals board a the variance and appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this article and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article b any person aggrieved by the decision of the variance and appeal board may appeal such decision to the circuit court as provided in kentucky revised statutes art 6  3 1614 appeals and variance procedures in passing upon such applications the variance and

sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges and culverts art 6  4 1614 conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article the variance and appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article 1 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum neces sary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of the ordinance from which this article is derived for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the board of adjustment need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the board of adjustment believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 3 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and  864 georgetown code supp no 9 614 c a determination that the granting

given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation e the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema upon request f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of section 864 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance art 6  5 1614 variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $100 of insurance coverage  2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks

floodplain management ordinance b4 article 1 statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives statutory authorization the legislature of the commonwealth of kentucky has in kentucky revised statutes krs  83a130 and 83a140 delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry krs  empowers local government to enact administrative regulations for floodplain management local governments participation in the national flood insurance program nfip assures the federal insurance administration that it will enact as necessary and maintain in force in those areas having flood or floodrelated erosion hazards adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions consistent with the criteria set forth in parts 59 60 and 65 of the national flood insurance program regulations 44 cfr therefore the fiscal court of scott county the city councils of georgetown and stamping ground and the city commission of sadieville kentucky hereby adopt the following floodplain management ordinance as follows findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of scott county and the cities of georgetown sadieville and stamping ground are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  b5 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage and  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas objectives the objectives of this ordinance are to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding  7 ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a special flood hazard area  and 8 ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume responsibility for their actions article 2 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application definitions contained in the zoning subdivision and development regulations of scott county may conflict and are intended for use in those provisions and

principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the fiscal court and city councils to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate designation of variance and appeal board the boards of adjustment for scott county and the cities of georgetown sadieville and stamping ground are hereby established as appeal boards the property location will determine the appropriate board to hear the appeal duties of variance and appeals board 1 the appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance 2 any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the circuit court as provided in kentucky revised statutes appeals and variance procedures in passing upon such applications the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and the b39 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  3 necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  4 availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  5 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  6 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  7 safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  8 expected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 9 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance 1 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the board of adjustment need not grant permission for the applicant to b40 build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the board of adjustment believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this ordinance 3 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure 4 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this ordinance  and c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation 6 the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request 7 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that b41 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and  2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the clerk of scott county and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification

require density measurements at the same 3 locations after subsequent passes of the compaction equipment compact the control strip until no further increase in density can be obtained from additional passes the inspector will visually inspect the material after each pass to determine if the aggregate is being crushed into fine material if the aggregate is being crushed cracked shoved or shows other signs of distress cease compaction efforts if compaction of the base is not satisfactory use other methods to achieve satisfactory results after completing compaction of the control strip the development inspector will require 10 field density measurements at random locations in the control strip and require the averaging of the 10 measurements to obtain the target density for the

obtained prior to the commencement of that process regulated by the permits a groundwater recharge base flows of local streams and waterways are fed by groundwater sources developments can cause changes in the amount of water that would be used to support base flows as the impervious area of a site increases so does the volume of runoff to maintain adequate base flows and stream ecosystems developments must incorporate practices in their storm water management plan to provide for treated groundwater recharge the amount of recharge that a site is capable of providing depends on topographic factors such as slope types of vegetation hydrological soil groups and locations of rock layers the average annual recharge volume for a site can be estimated by taking the average annual recharge rate of the hydrological soil groups dividing that by the average annual rainfall 4405 inches and then multiplying that result by 90 percent the following table provides a summary of the

infiltration facilities terraformed berms and infiltration swales since scott county is in a karst region designers that intend to use structural practices for groundwater recharge must evaluate potential areas to ensure that these proposed facilities would be adequate and not have an adverse impact on surrounding areas such as increasing the water table designers are to ensure that the groundwater recharge volume is to exit proposed facilities infiltration or a designed outlet and that the volume is treated by bmps prior to infiltration dewatering times for structural practices should not exceed 48 hours groundwater recharge requirements may be waived for redevelopments only if approved by the planning commission engineer b water quality protection the water chemistry of runoff is extremely important to the health of creeks and streams when enough rainfall occurs runoff from land areas is transported from these sites to drainage ways these drainage ways eventually reach the creek systems of scott county depending on the types of sites pollutants are transported by the force of the runoff or by its physical factors such as temperature and ph level water quality bmps are to be used to the maximum extent practical to minimize these impacts and to treat runoff from all proposed impervious surfaces for adequate treatment 90 percent of the average annual rainfall must be treated by stormwater bmps rainfall records from gmwss water treatment plant show that approximately 90 percent of total storm events occurred with 1 inch of rainfall or less the following

pollutants designers are to use structural and nonstructural bmps to the maximum extent practical to treat the water quality volume individual treatments or a combination of bmps can be used to achieve this goal different land uses can generate different types of runoff pollutants for instance a proposed refueling station would produce a higher concentration of hydrocarbons per acre than a proposed residential subdivision selection of bmps should be based on the anticipated pollutants for a site some examples of typical pollutants for different applications are 1 residential i setteable solids ii total suspended solids iii nitrogen iv phosphorous v metals 2 commercial and industrial i hydrocarbons ii trash iii setteable solids iv total suspended solids v nitrogen vi phosphorous vii

construction drawings and final development plans treated groundwater recharge volumes can count towards the required water quality volumes  however neither the groundwater recharge or water quality volumes are to be included in the channel protection and the water quantity control portion of the regulations c channel protection developments that require impervious areas and compacted fills reduce the amount of rainfall that previously infiltrated into the underlying soils the rainfall is then converted into runoff which eventually drains into the scott county creek systems frequent rainfall events help to shape stream geometries uncontrolled events after development can cause degradation to channel areas to protect channels from this degradation developments are to provide extended detention for the 1 year 24 hour event and allow the runoff produced to dewater over a 12 hour period storm water facilities designed for this condition will release flow at a rate not to exceed erosive flow rates in downstream channels channel protection may be waived but not limited to proposed sites that have less than 2 cfs for the post developed state designers are encouraged to protect channel and stream areas by not designing developments that require fill in headwater stream channels to within 50 feet of the bankfull conditions 15 to 2 year return periods of minor waterways and floodplains developments that utilize this option may qualify for density credits or other considerations similar to a planned urban development pud channel and stream areas that are disturbed due to grading andor other construction activities must be stabilized and comply with of the subdivision and development regulations references 2000 maryland stormwater design manual volumes i & ii center for watershed protection d water quantity control typically with development the volume of runoff increases due to the addition of impervious areas the compaction of soil materials and removal of vegetative cover some rainfall that once percolated into the ground would now travel over the surface developments must provide stormwater features that reduce the peak flow rates after development to what the runoff rates were prior to construction in addition to the 1 year channel protection requirement storm events that need to be adhered to are the 10 25 and 100 year 24 hour events rainfall intensities for those events are to be taken from division of water engineering memorandum no 2 current edition or most recent version in the past there have been storms that exceeded these design storm events designers are encouraged to analyze proposed developments with such rainfall intensities if they feel that it is necessary for safe guarding any proposed infrastructure storm sewer design proposed storm sewers systems that have the potential of being maintained by any municipality or government utility in scott county must adhere to the following guidelines 1 all proposed storm lines are to be reinforced concrete pipe rcp adsn12 or high density polyethylene equivalent a2000 or aluminized type ii corrugated metal pipe cmp with bituminous coating please note that cmp can

the 100year flow culverts are typically used in situations where drainage ways do not have any base flows associated with them head conditions occur on the upstream side to force the peak flow structures proposed culverts are to be designed so that the 100year water surface elevation is one foot below the overtopping elevation of the embankment bridge structures are to be used at creek and stream crossings where base flow conditions do exist base flow being defined as water being present in channel and stream areas during dry weather conditions these structures are to be designed to convey the 100year flow rate unimpeded and allow the 100year water surface elevation to be one foot below the bottom of the slab all proposed bridges are to be certified by the designer after

where roads must be improved due to development any portion of the roadway that is flooded by the 100 year event or less must be reconstructed to provide a concrete cap with a footer design on the upstream side to reduce the potential of a roadway being washed out open channel design developments that use open channels to convey runoff must adhere to the following guidelines 1 convey the 100 year event 2 designs not to exceed the channel linings critical shear force and permissible velocity in the 10 year event 3 select the appropriate roughness values for proposed channels 4 provide any
