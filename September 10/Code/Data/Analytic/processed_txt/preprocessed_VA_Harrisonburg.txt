3 years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified within the standard compliance by new sources is required under federal law on the date the standard is effective 1 nonsignificant categorical industrial users the authority may determine that a categorical industrial user is a nonsignificant categorical industrial user rather than a significant industrial user on a finding that the industrial user never discharges more than 100 gallons per day gpd of total categorical wastewater excluding sanitary noncontact cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater unless specifically included in the standard and the following conditions are met a the industrial user prior to the authoritys finding has consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards and requirements  b the industrial user annually submits the certification statement required in 40 cfr  40312q together with any additional information necessary to support the certification statement  and c the industrial user never discharges any untreated concentrated wastewater 2 equivalent limitations to those expressed as mass when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users in any such case the authority in calculating equivalent massperday limitations shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the categorical standard by the industrial users average rate of production this average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of the industrial users actual longterm daily production such as the average daily production during a representative year for new sources actual production shall be estimated using projected production further in any such case the authority in calculating equivalent concentration limitations

limitations to those expressed as concentration when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the authority convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the authority the authority may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the following conditions specified below to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate

authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined initially upon notification of a revised production rate the authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and i continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit the authority if it establishes equivalent mass limits will j calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average limits for the applicable categorical standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  k upon notification of a revised production rate reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and l retain the same equivalent mass limit in a subsequent wastewater discharge permit if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment the industrial user must also be in compliance with 40 cfr  40317 regarding the prohibition of bypass m the authority will not express limits in terms of

pretreatment standards or pretreatment requirements if the requirements of subsection 491a are met a conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset an industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that i an upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the causes of the upset  ii the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and iii the industrial user has submitted the following information to the authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance b burden of proof in any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof c reviewability of authority consideration of claims of upset no determinations made in the course of the review shall constitute final authority action subject to judicial review industrial users will have the opportunity for a determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards d user responsibility in case of upset the industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other

upset 2 bypass bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial users pretreatment facility severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production a bypass not violating applicable categorical standards or pretreatment requirements an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause categorical standards or pretreatment requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs b and c of this subsection b notice if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the authority if possible

hours c prohibition of bypass bypass is prohibited and the authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless  i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  and iii the industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection 492b the authority may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in this subsection c d the treatment cost recovery fees outlined in
