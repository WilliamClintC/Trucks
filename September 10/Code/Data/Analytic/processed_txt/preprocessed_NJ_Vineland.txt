health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored cause damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss 3

habitats and protect water and air quality control flooding and reduce stormwater runoff and erosion forests absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the  42584 general provisions  42585  atmosphere forests reduce greenhouse gas emissions especially carbon dioxide and they help control global warming 2 the planting maintenance and protection of trees benefits the citys environment planting or preserving trees can reduce energy demand in buildings and heating and cooling costs and trees are beneficial for stormwater management for controlling erosion and for masking urban noise trees can mitigate the adverse impacts of the urban heat island effect when planted in parking lots and streets trees are effective in cooling and beautifying the urban and the suburban environment 3 the clear cutting of forests and the removal of trees to prepare a development site has substantially adverse environmental impacts including increased drainage control costs increased soil erosion increased buildup of atmospheric carbon and increased dust 4 the purpose of these standards is to regulate and control indiscriminate and excessive cutting of trees and forests and preserve the maximum possible number of trees and forest area in the course of development of a site  to protect larger older specimens of trees  and to provide a plan for replacement of trees b applicability 1 the standards set forth in this section shall apply to all applications for subdivision site plan conditional use or use variance approval for sites greater than one acre in area and that have forest

to achieve a unified functional efficient and visually appealing physical setting the design orientation form and relationship of buildings landscaping signage lighting streets open spaces and parking to meet the public need for a well ordered community are basic considerations of community design to direct community design the citys development regulations include these design standards to maintain establish or improve the visual qualities and amenities of the city and provide for orderly safe efficient and convenient design within the city the purpose of the community design standards is to guide the appropriate use and development of lands in order to promote the  42585 general provisions  42586  public safety and general welfare  to encourage the location and design of transportation routes to promote the free flow of traffic  and to promote a desirable visual environment civic design and arrangement these provisions for community design shall supplement and be applied in conjunction with other design standards and provisions of this chapter to guide the layout and design of development in the city b applicability all tracts that are the subject of an application for subdivision site plan conditional use or use variance approval shall be subject to the standards set forth in this section the illustrations included with the community design standards are intended to further the understanding of the application and the purpose of the design standards the illustrations however do not supersede the written text of these regulations142 c building design and placement the following requirements are for nonresidential and attached residential buildings 1 front entrance a buildings should orient towards the street with front entrances and windows facing the street for commercial industrial mixeduse public and institutional buildings the front entrance is the main public entrance to the building in the case where no public entrance exists road connections shall be provided to the main employee entrance for multifamily buildings in which each unit does not have its exterior entrance the front entrance may be a lobby courtyard or breezeway that serves as a common entrance for more than one dwelling for detached residential buildings the front entrance is the front door ie facing the road b nonresidential buildings shall have a front entrance for pedestrians from the street side of the building to the building interior this entrance shall be designed to be attractive and functionally be a distinctive and prominent element of

hvac equipment trash dumpsters trash compaction and other service functions shall be incorporated into the overall design of the primary building using screening walls of compatible material style color texture pattern trim details and landscaping the wall shall be one foot higher than the largest object being screened but not more than 10 feet high on all sides where access is not needed an opaque gate with the same height as the wall shall be included where access is needed enclosures should not be visible from any street or sidewalk the maximum height in the screening requirement takes into account the height of a semi tractortrailer if such trucks will not be making deliveries or staging in this area the recommendation for maximum height may be lowered to eight feet at the discretion of the planning board 3 mechanical equipment mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the parking lot side of the building away from view from any streets and sidewalks and shall be screened from view by fencing vegetation or by being incorporated into a building utilizing the same materials as the principal building ie stone brick or stucco the screening shall be at least equal to the width and height of the equipment to be screened from view f access adjacent shopping centers or office parks are often not directly connected as a result customers or clients who wish to shop in both centers or visit both sites must exit the parking lot of one travel a short distance on a major thoroughfare and then access the next site a crossaccess easement reduces traffic on the major thoroughfare and reduces safety hazards this in turn can have positive business benefits by providing easy access to one site from another the purpose of these access regulations is to promote shared access and crossaccess arrangements for the convenient orderly and safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles  42586 general provisions  42586  1 jointuse driveways and crossaccess easements a system of jointuse driveways and crossaccess easements should be established wherever feasible and the building site should incorporate the following a a continuous service drive or cross

classification system and standards b stubouts and other design features to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide cross access via a service drive c a unified access and circulation system plan that includes coordinated or shared parking areas is encouraged wherever feasible 2 access for outparcels and phased development plans the design of good internal vehicle circulation in parking areas and on local streets reduces the number of driveways that businesses need for access to the major roadway requiring a unified access and circulation plan will ensure longterm coordination regardless of a change in owners and tenants in the interest of promoting unified access and circulation systems development sites under the same ownership or consolidated for the purposes of development and comprised of more than one building site should not be considered separate properties in relation to the access standards of this chapter the number of connections permitted shall be the minimum number necessary to provide reasonable access to these properties not the maximum permitted for that frontage all necessary easements agreements and stipulations

associated disturbance of vegetation and soil and changes in land cover including increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes if inadequately or improperly managed this stormwater runoff can deplete groundwater resources and increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpointsource pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land development and contribute to the degradation of the water resources of the city of vineland  certain lands of the city of vineland lie within the pinelands area and therefore development in this portion of the city of vineland is subject to the requirements of the pinelands protection act njsa a1 et seq and the implementing regulations and minimum standards contained in the pinelands

pinelands area have the potential to adversely affect the city of vinelands streams and water resources and the streams and water resources of downstream municipalities  stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpointsource pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites  it is in the public interest to regulate the discharge of stormwater runoff from major development projects as defined in  425217g of this section conducted within the pinelands area as provided in this section in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes to maintain groundwater recharge and to control and minimize soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpointsource pollution associated with stormwater runoff b therefore it is the purpose of this section to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for major development consistent with the statewide stormwater requirements at njac  et seq the regulations and standards contained in the pinelands cmp and the provisions of the adopted master plan and land use ordinances of the city of vineland 2 goals and techniques a through this section the city of vineland has established the following goals for stormwater control  to reduce flood damage including damage to life and property   to minimize any increase in stormwater runoff from new development   to reduce soil erosion from any development or construction project   to assure the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts and bridges and other instream structures   to maintain groundwater

techniques  nonstructural bmps shall include both environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to stormwater  source control plans shall be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin nature and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants  structural bmps where necessary shall be integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and proper maintenance plans  when using structural bmps multiple stormwater management measures smaller in size and distributed

established for each runway at an airport 2 each airport hazard area shall consist of a runway subzone two runway end subzones and two clear zones 3 the overall airport hazard area for an airport is geometrically constructed by defining and locating the runway subzone and runway end subzones for each runway open to the public on an airport open to the public the outermost borders of the subzones comprise the outermost boundary of the airport hazard area the area within those outermost boundaries is that area regulated by the provisions of this article and is the airport hazard area for an airport 4 the methodology used to delineate the overall construction and outermost boundaries of the airport hazard area for an airport is further graphically depicted in figure  b delineation of the runway subzone 1 the runway subzone of an airport hazard area shall consist of a rectangle having the same center line and length as the runway unless a shorter length is necessitated by limited property ownership at the airport 2 the width of the runway subzone shall be 2350 feet 3 the exact length of the runway subzone shall be determined by one of the two following methods a for most airports the length of the runway subzone will be the same as the physical length of the runway 213 editors note see figure 3 in the airport hazard area drawings included at the end of this chapter  425336 general provisions  425338  b if the physical end of a runway is closer than 200 feet to the property or easement line of the airport as measured along the runways extended center line then the end of the runway subzone shall be defined by a line drawn perpendicular to the runway center line at a point 200 feet inside of the airport property or easement line in this case a portion of the runway will extend beyond the bounds of the runway subzone 4 the methodology used to delineate the runway subzone of an airport hazard area is illustrated in figure  c delineation of the runway end subzones 1 the runway subzones of an airport hazard area shall consist of trapezoids located at either end of the runway subzone along the flight approach and departure path 2 each runway end subzone shall extend 3000 feet from the end of the runway subzone as measured along the extended center line of the runway 3 the base of the runway end subzone shall be defined by the end of the runway subzone and shall have a width of 2350 feet the width of the runway end subzone shall narrow as the distance from the end of the runway subzone increases its final width shall be 850 feet 4 the

ordinance standards establish the vertical limits up to which structures or trees may be allowed to be developed or grow within an airport hazard area b minimum obstruction ordinance standards are vertical standards measured in respect to elevations whose datum is the horizontal plane established by runway elevations for example if a point in an airport hazard area permits at a specific point development up to x feet that means x feet above the runway horizontal plane and not x feet above the natural grade of the land at that point in the airport hazard area see figure 4217 for graphic illustration c the vertical standards within the runway subzone of an airport hazard area are determined first by establishing the elevations at the runway center lines at the ends of the runway subzone of the airport hazard area from those elevations at the runway subzone ends a line is run 90 outward from each side of the runway center line for a distance of 125 feet within the area defined by these four points no development is allowed above the natural grade of the soil except for runway and flight safety equipment see figure  d the vertical standards within the remainder of the runway subzone of an airport hazard area are determined by establishing planes from the edges of the longitudinal zerofoot development restriction line see above which slope upward and outward at a rate of seven feet horizontally to one foot vertically this upward plane ceases when it reaches the outer longitudinal borders of the runway subzone of any airport hazard area at the elevation of 150 feet above its starting point at the longitudinal zerofoot development line see figure 5 amended 2131991 by  e the vertical standards within the runway end subzone of an airport hazard area are determined by first establishing a plane with a rising slope of one foot upward to 20 feet outward from the end of the runway subzone to the outermost end of the runway end subzone this plane is bisected by the extended runway center line and is 250 feet in total width at its innermost dimension and widens uniformly along its threethousand foot length so as to have a total width of 850 feet at its outermost dimension where it intersects with the outermost portion of the runway end subzone at an elevation of 150 feet above its starting point at the zerofoot development line f the vertical standards within the remainder of the runway end subzone of an airport hazard area are determined by establishing sloping planes from the outermost longitudinal edges of the plane established in 217 editors note
