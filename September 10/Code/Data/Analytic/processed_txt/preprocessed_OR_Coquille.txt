5 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare 7 variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very

purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote community health safety and welfare by protecting natural vegetation and setting development standards for the design installation and maintenance of landscaping street trees fences and walls  and for alterations to the same together these elements of the natural and built environment contribute to the visual quality environmental health and character of the community trees provide climate control during summer months and wind screening during winter trees and other plants can also buffer pedestrians from traffic walls fences trees and other landscape materials also provide vital screening and buffering between land uses landscaped areas help to control surface water drainage and can improve water quality as compared to paved or built surfaces likewise proper maintenance of landscape features is necessary to protect the public health and safety the chapter is organized into the following sections a landscape conservation prevents the indiscriminate removal of significant trees and other vegetation including vegetation associated with streams wetlands and other protected natural resource areas landscape conservation helps prevent soil erosion and landslide hazards while protecting natural resource values eg stream flow and water quality and community aesthetics conservation of native noninvasive plant and tree species is a high priority in areas subject to natural hazards such as hillsides and riparian areas regulation of tree removal in other areas of the city is intended to balance residential privacy with the desire for views from and solar access to individual residences b landscaping sets standards for and requires landscaping of all development sites that require site design review this section also requires buffering for parking and vehicle maneuvering areas and in some instances between different land uses to be applied in conjunction with division ii land use districts c street trees sets standards for and requires planting of trees where landscape park strips are designated street trees add to property values and community livability by providing summer shade along walks comfort and safety to pedestrians improved air quality along major streets and improved community aesthetics d fences and walls sets standards for new fences and walls including allowable height and materials to promote security personal safety privacy and aesthetics  part 2008   landscape conservation a applicability all development sites containing significant vegetation as defined by subsection b of this section shall comply with the standards of this section the purpose of this section is to incorporate significant native vegetation into the landscapes of development to the greatest extent practicable the retention of mature native vegetation within developments is a preferred alternative to removal of vegetation and replanting particularly on steep slopes and areas prone to landslide or susceptible to soil erosion mature landscaping provides summer shade and wind breaks controls erosion and allows for water conservation due to larger plants having established root systems b significant vegetation significant vegetation means individual trees and shrubs within an open space district any existing or proposed open space area within a development geological hazard areas floodplains and jurisdictional wetlands as determined by a natural resource agency with jurisdiction except that protection shall not be required for plants listed as nonnative invasive plants by the

identified by species and diameter or caliper at four feet above grade a protection area shall be defined around the edge of all branches drip line of each tree drip lines may overlap between trees the city also may require an inventory survey or assessment prepared by a qualified professional when necessary to determine construction boundaries building setbacks and other protection or mitigation requirements d protection standards significant trees and shrubs identified as meeting the criteria in subsection b of this section shall be retained to the extent practicable to minimize the risk of erosion landslide and storm water runoff where protection is impracticable because it would prevent reasonable development of public streets utilities or land uses permitted by the applicable land use district the city may allow removal of significant vegetation to provide for a reasonable building envelope area exclusive of required yard setbacks and areas for access and utilities where other areas must be disturbed to provide for construction staging areas the applicant shall be required to restore such areas after construction with landscaping to prevent erosion and to protect the public health safety and welfare with the owners consent the city may accept a land dedication or become a party to a conservation easement on private property for conservation purposes e constructionerosion and sediment control an erosion and sediment control plan is required for all new construction all significant vegetation on a site that is not otherwise designated and approved by the city for removal shall be protected prior to during and after construction in accordance with a limitofclearing and grading plan approved by the city the city may limit grading activities and operation of vehicles and heavy equipment in and around significant vegetation areas streams and other water bodies to prevent erosion pollution or landslide hazards see also estuarinecoastal shorelands ec resource overlay f exemptions the protection standards in subsections d and e of this section shall not apply to 1 dead or diseased vegetation dead or diseased vegetation may be removed from an area containing significant vegetation as defined by subsection b of this section provided the burden is on the property owner to demonstrate to the planning official that said vegetation is in fact diseased or dead before it is removed 2 hazardous vegetation and other emergencies significant vegetation may be removed without land use approval pursuant to division iv when the vegetation poses an immediate threat to life or safety or the vegetation must be removed for other reasons of emergency eg fallen over road or power line blocked drainage way or similar circumstance as

or more years after planting 1 existing vegetation existing noninvasive vegetation may be used in meeting landscape requirements when existing mature trees with a trunk diameter greater than ten 10 inches are protected on a development site eg within or adjacent to parking areas the decision making body may reduce the number of new trees required by a ratio of oneinch caliper of new trees for every oneinch caliper of existing trees protected this provision does not waive the requirement for landscape areas or breaks between parking bays under subsection e of this section  it only reduces the number of new trees that may be required where existing mature trees are preserved 2 plant selection a combination of deciduous and evergreen trees shrubs and ground covers shall be used for all

of vehicle and bicycle parking the design of parking areas is critically important to the economic viability of some commercial areas pedestrian and driver safety the efficient and safe operation of adjoining streets and community image and livability historically some communities have required more parking than is necessary for some land uses paving extensive areas of land that could be put to better use because vehicle parking facilities occupy large amounts of land they must be planned and designed carefully to use the land efficiently minimize storm water runoff and maintain the visual character of the community this chapter recognizes that each development has unique parking needs and provides a flexible approach for determining parking space requirements ie minimum and performancebased standards this chapter also provides standards for bicycle parking because many people use bicycles for recreation commuting and general transportation children as well as adults need safe and adequate spaces to park their bicycles throughout the community  part 2008   applicability all developments subject to site design review  including development of parking facilities shall

reviewed to determine whether it significantly affects a transportation facility in accordance with oregon administrative rule oar 6600120060 the transportation planning ruletpr and the traffic impact analysis provisions of significant means the proposal would 1 change the functional classification of an existing or planned transportation facility exclusive of correction of map errors this would occur for example when a proposal causes future traffic to exceed the levels associated with a collector street classification requiring a change in the classification to an arterial street as identified by the coquille comprehensive plan  2 change the standards implementing a functional classification system  3 as measured at the end of the planning period identified in the coquille comprehensive plan or the adopted plan of any other applicable roadway authority allow types or levels of land use that would result in levels of travel or access that are inconsistent with the functional classification of an existing or planned transportation facility  4 reduce the performance of an existing or planned transportation facility below the minimum acceptable performance

performance standard identified in the road authoritys adopted plan  or 6 where the city lacks specific transportation policies or standards the city council shall be consulted as provided under type iv procedure legislative b amendments that affect transportation facilities except as provided in subsection c of this section amendments to the comprehensive plan and land use regulations which significantly affect a transportation facility shall assure that allowed land uses are consistent with the function capacity and level of service of the facility identified in the comprehensive plan this shall be accomplished by one of the following 1 adopting measures that demonstrate that allowed land uses are consistent with the planned function of the transportation facility  2 amending the comprehensive plan to provide transportation facilities improvements or services adequate to support the proposed land uses  such amendments shall include a funding plan to ensure the facility improvement or service will be provided by the end of the planning period  3 altering land use designations densities or design requirements to reduce demand for automobile travel and meet travel needs modes of transportation  4 amending the planned function capacity or performance standards of the transportation facility  or 5 providing other measures as a condition of development or development agreement or similar funding method specifying when such measures will be provided c exceptions amendments to the comprehensive plan or land use regulations with a significant effect on a transportation facility where the facility is already performing below the minimum acceptable performance standard identified in the comprehensive plan may be approved when all of the following criteria are met 1 the amendment does not include property located in an interchange area as defined under applicable law  2 the currently planned facilities improvements or services are not adequate to achieve the standard  3 development resulting from the amendment will at a minimum mitigate the impacts of the amendment in a manner that avoids further degradation to the performance of the facility by the time of the development  and 4 the road authority provides a written statement that the proposed funding and timing for the proposed development mitigation are sufficient to avoid further degradation to the facility  part 2008 code interpretations   interpretationspurpose some terms or phrases within the code may have two or more reasonable meanings this section provides a

engaged in small commercial ventures that do not conform to the special standards for certain uses in e home occupation the standards referenced above allow home occupations as outright permitted uses that do not require development review or site design review this section provides a process for more intense home occupations to be allowed with site design review by the planning commission and notice to surrounding property owners these home occupations may be permitted with conditions of approval when appropriate in order to increase the benefits of people working and living in the same place while protecting neighboring residents from adverse impacts of home occupation activities these benefits to the business owner and to the general public include reduced number of commutetowork

not limited to drainage natural resources and parks will not be adversely affected any more than would occur if the development occurred in compliance with e  part 2008 division v  exceptions to variances   variancespurpose this chapter provides standards and procedures for variances which are modifications to land use or development standards that are not otherwise permitted elsewhere in this code as exceptions to code standards this code cannot provide standards to fit every potential development situation the citys varied geography and complexities of land development require flexibility this chapter provides that flexibility while maintaining the purposes and intent of the code the variance procedures provide relief from specific code provisions when they have the unintended effect of preventing reasonable development in conformance with all other codes the variance procedures are intended to provide flexibility while ensuring that the purpose of each development standard is met  part 2008   variancesapplicability a exceptions and modifications versus variances a code standard or approval criterion code section may be modified without approval of a variance if the applicable code section expressly allows exceptions or modifications if the code section does not expressly provide for exceptions or modifications then a variance is required to modify that code section and the provisions of this chapter apply b combining variances with other approvalspermit approvals by other agencies variance requests may be combined with and reviewed concurrently by the city approval body with other land use and development applications eg development review site design review subdivision conditional use etc however some variances may be subject to approval by other permitting agencies such as odot in the case of state highway access c types of variances as provided in there are two types of variances class a and class b  the type of variance required depends on the extent of the variance request and the discretion involved in the decision making process class a variances can be granted administratively by means of a type ii procedure  because they involve limited discretion class b variances require a public hearing under a type iii procedure  because they involve more discretion note some flexibility is builtin to the code for example for lot size averaging building height bonuses and flexible setbacks other standards such as permissible uses may be adjusted or modified only if approved as part of a master planned development under  part 2008   class a variances a applicability the following variances are reviewed using a type ii procedure as governed by using the approval criteria in subsection b of this section 1 front yard setbacks up to a ten 10 percent change to the front yard setback standard in the land use district 2 interior setbacks up to a ten 10 percent reduction of the dimensional standards for the side and rear yard setbacks required in the base land use district 3 lot coverage up to ten 10 percent increase of the maximum lot coverage required in the base zone 4 landscape area up to ten 10 percent reduction in landscape area overall area or interior parking lot landscape area b approval criteria a class a variance shall be granted if the applicant demonstrates compliance with all of the following criteria 1 the variance requested is to provide for greater compatibility between proposed structures and the built or natural environment or is needed to make more efficient use of the site 2 the variance will not result in violations of any other adopted ordinance or code standard  each code standard to be modified shall require a separate variance request 3 an application for a class a variances is limited to one lot per application 4 no more than three class a variances may be approved for one lot or parcel in twelve 12 months  part 2008   class b variances a applicability class b variance requests apply to the types of requests meeting the approval criteria in subsections b of this section class b variances shall be reviewed using a type iii procedure under are subject to the following limitations 1 the class b variance standards apply to individual platted and recorded lots only 2 the class b variance procedure shall not be used to modify a standard for lots yet to be created partition or subdivision process  such requests shall utilize the class c variance procedure 3 a variance shall not be approved that would vary the permitted uses or prohibited uses of a land use district division ii b variance to vehicular access and circulation standards  where vehicular access and circulation cannot be reasonably designed to conform to code standards within a particular parcel shared access with an adjoining property shall be considered if shared access in conjunction with another parcel is not feasible the city may grant a variance to the access requirements after finding all of the following 1 there is not adequate physical space for shared access or the owners of abutting properties do not agree to execute a joint access easement  2 there are no other alternative access points on the street in question or from another street  3 the access separation requirements cannot be met  4 the request is the minimum variance required to provide adequate access  5 the approved access or access approved with conditions will result in a safe access  6 the visual clearance requirements of will be met  7 variances for street access deviations shall be subject to review and approval by the roadway authority  8 variances for access deviations on a road rightofway shall be subject to review and approval by applicable road authority c variance to street tree requirements  the city may approve approve with conditions or deny a request for a variance to the street tree requirements in after finding the following 1 installation of the tree would interfere with existing utility lines and no substitute tree with a lower canopy is appropriate for the site  2 the tree would cause visual clearance problems  or 3 there is not adequate space in which to plant a street tree  and 4 the city may require the installation of additional or replacement landscaping elsewhere on the site eg parking lot area trees to compensate for the street tree variance  5 street tree approval or modification of standards within a rightofway requires approval by the road authority d variance to parking and loading standards  1 the city may approve variances to the minimum or maximum standards for offstreet parking quantities and dimensions of parking spaces in upon finding all of the following a the individual characteristics of the use at that location require more or less parking than is generally required for a use of this type and intensity or modified parking dimensions as demonstrated by a parking analysis or other facts provided by the applicant  b the need for additional parking cannot reasonably be met of onstreet parking or shared parking with adjacent or nearby uses  and c all other code standards are met in conformance with division ii land use districts and division iii community design standards 2 the city may reduce the number of required bicycle parking spaces per if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed use by its nature would be reasonably anticipated to generate a lesser need for bicycle parking 3 the city may allow a reduction in the amount of vehicle stacking area required in for driveif such a reduction is deemed appropriate after analysis of the size and location of the development limited services available and other pertinent factors 4 the city may modify the loading area standards if such a reduction is deemed appropriate after analysis of the use anticipated shipping or delivery traffic generated by the use and alternatives for loadingunloading such as use of on or offstreet parking areas during nonbusiness hours provided that traffic is not impeded e variance to maximum or minimum yard setbacks to avoid or reduce impacts in areas subject to geological hazards floodplains significant trees wetlands or other natural features chapters 1720 land use districts the city may grant a variance to the applicable setback requirements of this code for the purpose of avoiding or reducing impact to floodplains significant trees wetlands or other natural features modification of the standard shall not be more than is necessary for the preservation of the nature feature to be protected f variances to transportation improvement requirements  the city may approve approve with conditions or deny a variance to a transportation improvement standard city rightofway only in table f when the variance does not exceed ten 10 percent of the standard and as recommended by the city engineer when a variance request to the standards in table f exceeds ten 10 percent then the request shall be reviewed as a class c variance  part 2008   variance application and appeals a application the variance application shall conform to the requirements for type ii or iii applications  as applicable in addition the applicant shall provide a narrative or letter explaining the reason for his or her request alternatives considered how the stated variance criteria are satisfied and why the subject standard cannot be met without the variance b appeals to variance decisions shall be processed in accordance with the appeal provisions of c expiration a variance approval shall expire if not acted upon by the property owner within one year of the city approving the variance where the owner has applied for a building permit or final plat or has made site improvements consistent with an approved development plan eg site design review or preliminary subdivision plan the planning official may extend the variance approval accordingly  part 2008 nonconforming uses and developments   nonconforming uses and developments purpose this chapter provides standards and procedures for nonconforming situations ie
