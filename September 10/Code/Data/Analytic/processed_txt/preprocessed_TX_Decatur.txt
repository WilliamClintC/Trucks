the existing rightofway or structures which cannot be relocated changes in the direction of a street or thoroughfare are minimized by constructing a simple curve having a radius which is compatible with the speed of vehicular traffic to increase the safety and reduce discomfort to drivers traversing a curved portion of a street or throroughfare the pavement may be superelevated for small deflection angles horizintal curves should be sufficiently long to avoid appearance of a kink curves should be at least five hundred 500 feet long for a central angle of five 5 degrees and the minimum length should be increased to one hundred 100 feet for each one 1 degree decrease in the central angle curvature in the alignment of arterials is allowed under certain conditions but the greater traffic volume and the higher vehicle speeds which accompany these thoroughfares tend to increase the number of accidents when curving of alignment occurs curves in the alignment of minor streets usually provide aesthetic value to residential neighborhoods without affecting the orderly flow of traffic or safety a recommended minimum radius of curvature or vehicle design speed and pavement crossslopes is shown in table h these are based on traffic consisting of typical present day automobiles operating under optimum weather conditions there are other important considerations in the

appendix d to read as herein set out at the editors discretion state law reference texas local government i  introduction the city of decatur texas is located in wise county fortyfive miles northwest of the fort worth metropolitan area decatur enjoys a population of over 5200 people 1  within its city limits with nearly that many in its extraterritorial jurisdiction etj and outlying area spanning over 4000 acres of rolling terrain the city offers varying land uses from rural residential to urban apartments and from commercial agriculture support to retail and commercial with some industrial decatur is fully within the award winning decatur independent school district disd which extends well beyond the decatur city limits the city and disd are proud of its blue ribbon schools and high achieving extra curricular programs decatur has also been an exemplary texas main street city for nearly ten years this broad range of land uses commitment to excellence and advantageous location makes decatur a very attractive site for prospective families and commercialretail industries the dallas fort worth metroplex is increasingly expanding and wise county is on the edge of that growth a recent study done by harvard university 3  concluded that the population of wise county would more than double over the next two decades with the expected rate of growth the strong sense of identity that decatur maintains can only be preserved and nurtured by moving forward with purpose this comprehensive plan sets forth that purpose footnotes    according to the 2000 us census according to the texas education agency decatur is part of the region 11 fort worth region    harvard universitys graduate school of design 1  mission statement the mission of this comprehensive plan is to guide and enhance the growth and operation of the city of decatur while improving the economic wellbeing and quality of life for all its citizens it is vital that these efforts maintain the unique character and heritage of the city in order to insure that a sense of community pride and belonging will be shared by this and all future generations the primary objectives of this comprehensive plan are to  influence and manage the development of the community   minimize conflict between land uses   predict infrastructure and service needs in advance of demand   increase both the benefits and cost effectiveness of public investment   ensure that community facilities are located to best serve the community  and  coordinate public and private investment the comprehensive plan policies are intended to provide guidance in the evaluation of future decisions on land use infrastructure improvements transportation and other issues ordinances that are proposed and considered after the adoption of the comprehensive plan policies should be consistent with the relevant goals and policies contained in the plan if an ordinance instituting or modifying rules or regulations is being considered which is contrary to the goals and policies of the plan either the plan should be reviewed and amended prior to the adoption of the ordinance or it should be clearly stated what circumstances necessitate that it be in conflict with the plan the comprehensive plan provides the basis for rational decisionmaking and serves as a guide to the governing body the city council this comprehensive plan does not replace the decisionmaking process nor does it take the place of the citys development ordinances or other ordinances in establishing regulations implementation of the comprehensive plan is at the sole discretion of the citys governing body the enactment of the comprehensive plan policies does not constitute a substantive change in existing ordinances of the city of decatur nor does it supersede or replace the development ordinances or any regulatory ordinances adopted prior to the adoption of the comprehensive plan in the event of apparent conflict between the comprehensive plan and current ordinances of the city the current ordinances will control in applying such ordinances consideration should be given to the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan in an attempt to reconcile the two provisions planning is a continuous and dynamic process that helps the community achieve goals that are important to its citizens and to the community at large over time these goals will likely change then the community must again review where they have been how they got there what has changed since their last planning effort and where they want to go next this is a normal planning process and it happens in all communities 2  history of the development of decatur for most of the 20 th century decatur was just another small north texas city with a great history over the course of a few short years at the end of the 20s the city was transformed from a busy provincial settlement into a quiet small town its once sturdy agricultural and mineral economic base that supported a thriving population of 3200 in 192 slowly bottomed out and its stagnant population hovered between 2300 and 3000 until the early 70s by the end of the 1970s the citys population began to grow found by couples searching for the right kind of place to raise families and commuters responding to the expanding job market on balance the century had been kind to the city out of the way and maintaining its rural atmosphere the urban core of decatur was so well designed that there was little need to distort its classical lines to accommodate the evergrowing automobile traffic colonel absolom bishop first arrived in what would soon become wise county in 1854 bishop helped organize the campaign to carve wise county out of the undifferentiated territory known as peters colony in 1856 the county creation bill which delineated the boundaries of wise county passed state legislature in austin with the incorporation of the county the need arose to create a county seat which at the time was required to be within 5 miles of the countys center in preparation for this bishop had inked a deal with james proctor in 1854 proctors property some 160 acres covered the hilltop upon which the city now stands bishop convinced proctor to deed 60 acres to the newly formed city the return for which would be a dramatic increase in land values enjoyed by proctor as the city was built bishop set to the platting of the original city with determination an early historian of decatur declared that to his natural endowments of taste and an orderly mind colonel bishop brought to the task before him the garnered observations of broad travel and the experience of metropolitan life which intangibles he worked into the grand plan of the county capital of wise county rejecting the erratic construction and the haphazard building plans that often accompanied the creation of new urban centers on the frontier bishop was keen to ensure that the new city developed in accord with his specific vision of a systematically developed urban area that remained centered on the square to this end and armed with hefty pile of burroak stakes bishop set about surveying and laying out the town initially known as taylorsville after president zachary taylor whose fierce prosecution of the mexicanamerican war of the mid 1840s had greatly impressed the novice city planner bishops affection for the president quickly palled in the wake of taylors pronouncement that he would happily use the same kind of force to bring dissident states into line with the federal government and led to bishops successful petition to have the citys name changed to decatur in honor of the naval hero commodore stephen decatur although overtly inspired by the squarecentered and compact street design of nearby mckinney bishops city design further revealed the influence of colonial practice and 18 th century neoclassical aesthetics in his minds eye bishop conjured the image of a compact hillside community whose orderly grid of streets would form a coherent system that radiated outward from the central public square this specific form of urban organization not only revealed the impact of the simple rational yet balanced attributes of classical aesthetics which had shaped many of the cities in the eastern colonies but also the rectilinear grid that dominated the spanish colonial cities to the south true to his reputation bishop sought and largely succeeded to create a virtue out of the limited availability of level building sites in the city by ensuring the city square was on the very tip of the hill one of the flattest pieces of land in the city at that time not surprisingly this aspect of the citys design reflected bishops dominant principles and the continuing common sense view that civic life is guided shaped and responsive to the mutually reinforcing bulwarks of commerce and law bishops design effectively solidified the elevation of this principle as the majority of the budding citys residents would have to ascend the hill in order to participate in the public life of the city indeed one historian attributes a vision of a gleaming palace of justice towering above the prairies to bishop by centralizing both legal and commercial activities in the city bishop was forcefully asserting the primacy of these two aspects of community life in the face of the absence of both in the surrounding area as well as the citys uncertain future by the turn of the century the center of decatur was in place the citys third and final courthouse was completed in 1896 and the majority of the limestone and brick buildings that ring the square outnumbered the cheaper wood framed structures the romanesque revival style county courthouse was commissioned after the third wooden one burned in the opening weeks of 1895 it was completed in 1896 as was the case in many north american cities the last decade of the 19 th and the first decade of the 20 th centuries were marked by a rapid modernization with the introduction of new services such as electricity and sanitary sewers and potable water while the introduction of services and the growing importance of the motor car allowed for greater territorial spread of housing particularly noticeable at the time along the major thoroughfare of college the commercial and social life of the city was still focused on the square and courthouse after the successful conclusion of the indian wars decatur enjoyed an extended period of prosperity into the 1920s these years were marked by population growth territorial expansion the creation of new services the addition of a railroad depot and in the latter half of this idyllic period the development of an oil and gas industry the decade that marked the citys greatest expansion was the 1880s in 1880 there were 579 residents in the city and by 1890 the citys population had ballooned to 1746 the rapid expansion of the population was fostered by the arrival in 188 of the fort worth and denver railroad although the rail line effectively stunted the citys potential for eastward expansion the depot linked local producers to distant markets and served as a catalyst for the coming decades rapid developments its hard to underestimate the economic and social impact of the railroad on small frontier cities by slashing the cost of transporting products and people the railway entwined the city in a farreaching web of business social and cultural relations in order to further minimize transport costs businesses clustered around the rail terminal in the city the industrial development around the railroad diverted economic focus to the eastern half of the city and helped consolidate the commercial and legal activities in the center as industry continued to develop housing began filling in the citys vacant lots with two newspapers a theater a post office a number of dry goods retail outlets and different official buildings all located within spitting distance of the square the center of town was the cultural and social hub of the city precisely as bishop had hoped it would be the crash of 1929 and subsequent great depression stifled development in the city and the population contracted as residents sought out opportunities elsewhere as the regional economy stagnated the population declined leaving decatur to quietly and quickly shift to just another small city through these difficult times the city maintained its integrity and unique status as the county seat which in turn helped realize a series of improvements the construction of us 380 originally known as highway 24 and highway 81 in the 1930s followed by the relocation of highway 81 to the current location of 28781 in 1968 and the construction of the us 380 bypass completed in 1987 provided means by which decatur could experience a new surge of growth with the new millennium decatur has experienced what some might consider a negative impact from the railroad and the new highways that exacerbated the effect of dividing the heart of the city from outlying areas the infrastructure that caused this division creating a boundary between the citys older buildings and sites for future expansion also spurred development on one hand the new highways had the effect of pulling traffic away from the downtown core encouraging new business on the outskirts of town and straining the downtown businesses on the other hand it ensured that citys compact historic center remained largely unchanged awaiting to be rediscovered decatur has managed to retain much of its historical charm while standing ready to embrace the future in november of 199 the city of decatur informally adopted a comprehensive master plan this document developed by an outside consulting firm was a gathering of multiple reports prepared over a span of eighteen years while the document as a whole was not formally adopted the drainage element was adopted by ordinance in april of 198 the capital improvements
