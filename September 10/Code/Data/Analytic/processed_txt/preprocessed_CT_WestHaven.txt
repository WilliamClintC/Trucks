purpose the zoning districts established in these regulations are designed to guide the future use of the citys land by encouraging the development of desirable residential commercial and manufacturing areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare establishment of minimal area and bulk standards which are determined in conformity with the intended permitted use of the property and surrounding properties as a necessary corollary in order to carry out such purposes nonconforming or noncomplying uses which adversely affect the development of such areas must be subject to certain limitations the regulations governing nonconforming and noncomplying uses set forth in this therefore adopted in order to provide a gradual remedying of existing undesirable conditions resulting from such incompatible use of property which is detrimental to the achievement of the purposes of these regulations when such uses are generally permitted to continue these regulations are designed to restrict further investment in such uses which would make them more permanent establishments in inappropriate locations in the case of buildings structures andor lots not complying with the applicable area and bulk requirements of the regulations the regulations governing same set forth in this adopted to permit the appropriate use of such buildings but prevent the creation of additional noncompliances increases in the degree of existing noncompliance or expansions which would be detrimental to the safety and welfare of the surrounding neighborhood these regulations are thus designed to preserve the character of the districts established in these regulations in the light of their particular suitability to specified uses and thus to promote and protect public health safety and general welfare 812 definitions each of the following definitions shall apply to situations which will

which preexists these regulations that does not conform to its requirements shall be encouraged to phase itself out and be replaced by conforming or at least more conforming uses that would be more compatible with the uses in the district in which the property lies  nonconforming residential uses except as otherwise provided herein no property which presently being utilized for residential purposes shall be required to terminate because of its nonconforming status provided said use was conforming at the time of its origination  discontinuance of dangerous uses in residential districts

the active operation of substantially all the nonconforming uses in any building or other structure is abandoned such land or building or other structure shall thereafter be used only for a conforming use discontinuance of such use will be determined to be abandonment if there is also an intent to discontinue such use building or structure  change of nonconforming use for the purpose of this section is a change to another use not of the same use type as determined by the planning and zoning commission a change in ownership or occupancy shall not by itself constitute a change of use a nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use and the applicable district bulk regulations and accessory offstreet parking and loading requirements shall apply to such change of use or to alterations made to accommodate such conforming use wherever possible but shall apply to an enlargement or expansion a formerly nonconforming use shall not again be changed to a nonconforming use

provisions the continued use of a noncomplying building or other structure shall be permitted except as otherwise provided by this article a noncomplying building is defined as one in which its use complies with that as permitted by these regulations either as of right by special permit by special use exception or as a valid nonconforming use but does not comply with the area and bulk requirement of the regulations for each district a noncomplying structure therefore does not refer to the use to which the property is being put but rather the location size or similar characteristic of the structure no new building or structure shall be erected except as provided herein in interpreting this each subsection shall be deemed mutually exclusive such that only one subsection shall apply to any particular situation  repairs and alterations incidental repairs and alterations may be made in a noncomplying building or other structure provided they do not create a new noncompliance or increase the degree of noncompliance of the building or other structure or any portion thereof  enlargements or conversions a noncomplying building or other structure may be enlarged or converted provided that no enlargement or conversion may be made which would either create a new noncompliance or increase the degree of noncompliance of the building or other structure or any portion thereof an enlargement is defined as creating additional units rooms or a greater degree of lot coverage if an existing lot and building are noncomplying because the lot area per dwelling unit is less than required then such building may be enlarged converted only provided that the deficiency in the required lot area per dwelling unit is not increased  1017 file # zr17063  823 degree of noncompliance

where an addition is requested that would increase the height of a structure that is within the required yard setback the height may only be only be increased in the proportion of one foot in height to every foot in distance between the requested expansion and the existing structure on the adjacent lot or its required yard whichever is closer failure to meet each of these requirements shall be considered to be an increase in the noncompliance and therefore shall not be permitted  commercial degree of noncompliance shall be determined as the extent of the inability to meet a specific bulk requirement no noncompliance shall be permitted to be increased where the bulk requirement which is currently being violated by a greater amount ie an addition to a building such that the existing 8 foot setback where 10 feet is required cannot be changed to 3 foot setback thereby increasing the degree of noncompliance however it shall not be deemed an increase in the noncompliance where an
