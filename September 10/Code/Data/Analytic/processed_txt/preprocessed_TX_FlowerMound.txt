reference authority to regulate location of sexually oriented businesses and to require a permit vtca local government  division 1  generally findings a the following are found to be true and correct 1 vtca local government authorizes home rule cities to license any lawful business occupation or calling that is susceptible to the control of the police power 2 vtca local government authorizes home rule cities to enforce all ordinances necessary to protect health life and property and to preserve the good government order and security of such cities and their inhabitants 3 sexually oriented businesses require special supervision from public safety agencies of cities in order to protect and preserve the health safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of such cities 4 sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 5 the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of cities which demands reasonable regulation of sexually oriented businesses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of its citizens 6 licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 7 there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime and the downgrading of property values 8 police in numerous other jurisdictions have made a substantial number of arrests for sexually related crimes in sexually oriented business establishments 9 it is recognized that sexually oriented businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent areas b the town council desires to 1 minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  2 deter the spread of urban blight  3 protect the citizens from increased crime  4 preserve the quality of life  and 5 protect the health safety and welfare of its citizenry c with regard to the licensing of sexually oriented business establishments the town council makes the following findings 1 it is in the interest of the public safety and welfare to prohibit persons convicted of certain crimes from engaging in the occupation of operating a sexually oriented business 2 the town council in accordance with vernons ann civ st art 625213c has considered the following criteria a the nature and seriousness of the crimes  b the relationship of the crimes to the purposes for requiring a license to engage in the occupation  c the extent to which a license might offer an opportunity to engage in further criminal activity of the same type as that in which the person previously had been involved  and d the relationship of the crimes to the ability capacity or fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the licensed occupation and has determined that the crimes listed in section 18332a9 are serious crimes which are directly related to the duties and responsibilities of the occupation of operating a sexually oriented business the town council has further determined that the very nature of the occupation of operating a sexually oriented business brings a person into constant contact with persons interested in sexually oriented materials and activities thereby giving the person repeated opportunities to commit offenses against public order and decency or crimes against the public health safety or morals should the person be so inclined thus it is the opinion of the town council that the listed crimes render a person unable incompetent and unfit to perform the duties and responsibilities accompanying the operation of a sexually oriented business in a manner that would promote the public safety and trust 3 the town council has determined that no person who has been convicted of a crime listed in section 18332a9 is presently fit to operate a sexually oriented business until the respective time period designated in that section has expired 4 it is the intent of the town council to disqualify a person from being issued a sexually oriented business license by the town if the person has been convicted within the designated time period of any of the crimes listed in section 18332a9 ch 4  401 purpose and intent of article a it is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the town and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the town the provisions of the

nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexual oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market b it is the intent of the town council that the locational regulations of section 18361 are promulgated pursuant to vtca local government the town charter and

texas legislature has in the flood control insurance act vtca water delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of flower mound texas are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  2 352018 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in

bar sink faucets this program will be implemented by code inspectors and monitored by the town manager and shall become effective on the effective date of the adoption of this plan it is not expected to increase the costs of code enforcement  1 5202019 reserved conservation oriented rate structure a the town of flower mound recognizes that an increasing block rate structure will encourage water users to reduce water use and thereby increase water conservation with an increasing block rate the price per 1000 gallons of water increases as the quantity used increases thereby discouraging excessive and wasteful water use b the town has an increasing block rate structure as evidenced by the towns rate structure which is on file in the office of the town secretary  1 5202019 metering and meter testing the purpose of metering is to measure the quantity of water being distributed to customers throughout the system to account for all the water being produced and to accurately bill for the quantity of water delivered to each customer the town of flower mound recognizes the need for universal and accurate metering the towns schedule for testing meters is as follows 1 compound meters two inches and larger and hpt meters three inches and larger  test calibrate and repair annually 2 meters two inches or smaller  test andor replace every ten years these activities can be performed by the town as a part of its routine operation and maintenance activities it will be monitored by the meter services section it is expected that the costs will be offset by more accurate accounting and billing resulting in enhanced revenues  1 5202019 water conservation landscaping well designed and properly maintained demonstration landscapes located in parks and other highly visible areas will promote the waterconserving landscape concept as opportunities occur the town will plan xeriscape landscaping for its parks and other facilities such landscaping should emphasize native species and low water consuming plant types also the town will encourage garden clubs developers and customers to implement water efficient landscaping the town will participate with the utrwd in demonstration gardens developed as part of the regional program brochures on water demand of certain grasses and on outdoor water use in general will be mailed to all customers initially and provided to all new customers  1 5202019 irrigation practices the town of flower mound will explore opportunities for conserving water irrigation practices including 1 prohibiting wasteful uses of water from irrigation systems such as a overwatering lawns and gardens in excess of what is actually required thereby causing water to escape from irrigated areas or run off into gutters ditches streets sidewalks and other surface drains  b watering during the heat of the day when losses due to evaporation are high  c operating sprinkler systems during periods of rainfall 2 the partitioning of any given irrigation system so as to provide sequential operation of segments of the system rather than simultaneous operation 3 the distribution of a brochure providing helpful tips when a permit is issued for a sprinkler system and periodically thereafter 4 require all new irrigation systems be in compliance with state design and installation standards tac title 30   1 5202019 water audits and leak detection a the town is aware of potential savings from leak detection studies and water audits the town is committed to maintain low unaccountedfor water losses in its water system and in recent years has experienced less than five percent loss because of the responsiveness of the various utility service departments and a relatively new water system although the current management practices have been successful in maintaining low water losses the town currently does not have an established leak detection and repair program the fiveyear and tenyear water loss goals are five percent and four percent respectively b audit results will continue to be evaluated  1 5202019 wastewater recycling and reuse a the leading types of potential recycling and reuse projects are 1 use of wastewater effluent for irrigation of parks andor golf courses 2 transmission of wastewater effluent to a surface water reservoir project for treatment and reuse as a public water supply 3 installation of gray water water from the washing machine showers and bathtubs tanks in homes for lawn and landscape watering 4 recycling and reuse of treated effluent by or for industrial commercial and institutional customersas well as for irrigation of open space such as parks and golf courses b the town has two reuse water master plans that take advantage of nearby wastewater treatment plant effluent one was adopted in 2014 and covers the western area of flower mound and the other was adopted in 2018 and covers the southeast area of flower mound the treatment of wastewater effluent is recognized as an excellent method of conserving drinking water use of reuse water for irrigation purposes  1 5202019 pressure control the town of flower mound recognizes that adequate pressure control throughout its distribution system can improve water conservation the transmission system should be sized to maintain a minimum pressure of 40 psi during normal operating conditions and a minimum pressure of 20 psi during extreme operating conditions in addition pressures above 90 psi are undesirable and should be avoided the maximum pressure in extreme conditions should be limited to 120 psi because high operating pressure will result in increased system maintenance and increased operational cost the transmission system should also be sized to limit maximum velocity in the transmission system to seven cubic feet per second  1 5202019 enforcement of article provisions a the water conservation plan will be implemented and enforced under the general direction of the town manager methods and costs of implementation are described below 1 public information and education the town will make copies available of the water conservation plan including copies of the water conservation methods to customers civic groups and other groups upon request also copies of the plan and literature will be given to the local newspapers for use in writing water conservation articles 2 water conservation plumbing fixtures the vtca texas health and safety et seq sets out conservation standards for plumbing fixtures sold within texas these standards are listed in section 70465 above 3 water conserving landscape the town will cooperate with the utrwd in informing nurseries and the public of plants and shrubs that are native to the area the budget for this activity will be included in the budget for public information and education 4 leak detection and water audits the town will be alert to leak detection will emphasize water audits and will repair leaks to save water and reduce operation costs technical assistance for leak detection and water audits is available from the twdb and from the utrwd no budget increase is expected for this water conservation activity 5 wastewater reuse and recycling the use of wastewater effluent from the central sewage collection and treatment system for irrigation of parks golf courses or forage crops is incorporated in to the towns water master plan other opportunities will be considered any such use must be planned and evaluated on an individual basis also opportunities for recycling and reuse of effluent by or for industrial commercial and institutional customers will be explored b the use of gray water systems in homes for lawn and landscape watering may be possible in some parts of the service area  but may not be acceptable within more densely populated portions of the service area gray water systems are most easily installed as homes are being built existing homes can be retrofitted with a gray water system at a higher cost in the case of new homes gray water tanks piping and pumping equipment for a family of four would cost approximately $400000 to install the costs to install such a system in existing homes may be considerably higher since piping would need to be modified and pumps added c the town encourages water reuse and recognizes that the cost of water reuse will be borne by the beneficiaries to the extent that water reuse saves water and lowers monthly water bills the benefits can be used to repay the costs of reuse projects d the town manager will be responsible for implementation of the water conservation program punitive enforcement measures are not expected to be required by adoption of this plan the town is directing and authorizing the town manager to take all steps reasonably necessary to implement and enforce the plan  1 5202019 review and evaluation the town shall maintain a record management system to record water pumped delivered sold and lost which allows the classification of water sold and used by user categories ie residential commercial public and institutional and industrial the town is required to submit an annual water conservation implementation report to tceq and twdb said reports must be completed by may 1 of the following year for the previous year and used to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of the town water conservation program

requirements for successive customer conservation the town will include a requirement in every water supply contract entered into or renewed after official adoption of the water conservation plan and including any contract extension that each successive wholesale customer develop and implement a water conservation plan or water conservation measures using the applicable elements of title 30 tac if the customer intends to resell the water then the contract between the initial supplier and customer must provide that the contract for the resale of the water must have water conservation requirements so that each successive customer in the resale of the water will be required to implement water conservation measures in accordance with the provisions of 30 tac  1 5202019 coordination with regional planning groups the town will provide a copy of this water conservation plan to the region c water planning group which is responsible for developing regional water use information for the planning of future water needs flower mound will cooperate with regional water agencies by providing information participating in cooperative conservation programs and with usage reductions initiated as a result of drought or other conditions in addition a copy of this approved plan will be sent to both tceq and twdb  1 5202019 secs 7047870500  reserved division 3  shortterm water

purpose and objectives smartgrowth criteria effectuate the community vision and values embodied in the flower mound master plan by translating them into constitutive development criteria to evaluate the communitywide impacts of development applications and projects for the purpose of ensuring that development occurs in a manner that contributes to the accomplishment of community character and quality of life objectives there are three general types of smartgrowth criteria used in the smartgrowth program a performancebased criteria relative to the adequacy of public service levels b per unit of population criteria relative to the adequacy of public facilities c valuesbased qualitative criteria relative to community character and quality of life objectives the smartgrowth criteria have also been grouped into six general categories as follows adequate public infrastructure adequate public facilities adequate public services economic development environmental quality and community character d3 7152002 evaluation a in applying the smartgrowth criteria to a specific development application or project a passfail evaluation will be utilized to determine compliance with applicable criteria in other words for a development application or project to attain compliance with the smartgrowth program ensuring that it contributes to community character and quality of life objectives it must be evaluated as passing or complying with each applicable smartgrowth criterion otherwise it will fail and be denied until such time as compliance is or can be attained b for analysis of large multiphase projects over 100 acres in area the evaluation will include a development agreement that captures the timing of the infrastructure construction and phasing with this information upfront modeling and planning for buildout of the entire development can be included in the water and wastewater models with a check for adequacy of the existing infrastructure if there exists an inadequacy of the existing infrastructure the phasing and timing of construction of the additional infrastructure required will be addressed in the development agreement modeling updates for the current and next two years of development in accordance with the phasing plan provided by the developer will be included with the initial application each subsequent site plan or final plat will include model updates c with 2009 updates to the water master plan and wastewater master plan and associated townwide models a hybrid approach to include model updates will be implemented this effort
