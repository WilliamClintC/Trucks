districts are hereby established these districts are ordered and classified according to a ruralurban transect the transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environments as a continuum of six conditions ranging from rural to urban the value of the transect is that it serves to locate any given place within a context in which all of the parts fit together harmoniously for example a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings look like farmhouses or barns an urban street depending on the intensity of urbanism may have curbs and gutters regularly placed street trees sidewalks and building forms that include common walls flat roofs and cornices each transect zoning category has detailed provisions for each neighborhood for density height street design the design of parks the mix of uses building design parking and other aspects of the human environment the transect begins with two zones that are entirely rural in character natural zone or t 1 which is made up of lands protected in perpetuity  and rural zone t2 which includes areas of high environmental or scenic quality that are not currently preserved but perhaps should be the transition zone between countryside and town is called the suburban zone t3 which encompasses the most rural part of the neighborhood and the countryside just beyond the t3 area is primarily single family homes although the t3 area is the most purely residential zone it can have some mixeduse such as civic buildings  schools are particularly appropriate for the t3 area next is the general urban zone t4 typically the largest zone urban residential is primarily residential but more urban in character having somewhat higher density with a mix of housing types and a slightly greater mix of uses allowed at the more urban end of the spectrum are two zones which are primarily mixed use urban center or t5 this can be a small neighborhood center or a larger town center the latter serving more than one neighborhood the urban core or downtown t6 serves the region not only adjacent neighborhoods and is typically understood as the central business district additionally the special districts make allowance for autodependent activities such as big box retail institutional campuses and industrial zones the zoning districts for the city of salisbury have thus been ordered along this transect providing an appropriate detailing of development at each end of the continuum rather than homogenous standardization as well as a simplified tool for users of this use to facilitate appropriate

discount on the pay in lieu fee 3 high spi score   12 or greater street segments within this scoring range may either construct the required sidewalk or pay in lieu with no discount the sidewalk priority index spi is intended to ensure that sidewalks are first constructed or repaired where existing need is the greatest and where the potential for pedestrian traffic is the greatest in general pedestrian activity is directly attributable to factors or pedestriangenerating characteristics such as proximity to major destinations specific zoning districts and transit routes by overlapping multiple characteristics one can easily visualize the concentration of resources in a particular area the cumulative intensity of all characteristics at a specific location determines the varying levels of prioritization the spi effectively adapts this methodology by identifying the specific characteristics that most affect the potential for walking in salisbury those districts and pedestrian generating characteristics have been assigned the following values and scores are determined for street segments based on aggregating overlapping characteristics 1 all applicable zoning districts have been assigned a value according to the following table osp rr gr mhd ur hr rmx nmx cmx ci dmx tnd hs hb li hi spi na spi value of 0 spi value of 1 spi value of 2 spi value of 3 spi value of 1 spi

the following are assigned a value of 3 a colleges factors contributing to colleges generating heavy pedestrian activity include a young population businesses that cater to students and the fact that many students do not own automobiles in addition students faculty and staff often live nearby therefore all street segments within  mile of all college campuses are assigned a value of 3 b greenways & parks greenways and parks attract recreational users of all ages greenways specifically are part of the pedestrian infrastructure itself and are used for transportation purposes additionally salisbury is unique in that all parks in the system except for the community park are accessible by foot and are all adjacent to an existing neighborhood therefore all street segments within mile of existing greenways and parks are assigned a value of 3 c transit almost all bus users begin and end their trips as pedestrians accordingly safe and continuous pedestrian facilities are an integral component of a public transit system therefore all street segments within mile of a transit route are assigned a value of 3 3 the following are assigned a value of 2 a high schools based on the fact that elementary middle and high schools can generate many daily walking trips by students whose ages typically make them among the most vulnerable pedestrians all street segments within mile of high schools are assigned a value of 2 b historic overlay based on the traditional grid street network traditional mediumdensity platting and the proximity of these district overlays to neighborhood service and support all street segments within the overlay are assigned a value of 2 4 the following are assigned a value of 1 a civic facilities because salisburys civic buildings provide services to a wide range of users including children senior adults and disabled people all street segments within a mile of these facilities have been assigned a value of 1 b commercial nodes based on the potential for higher density housing and mixing of uses generally located in pods at significant intersections throughout the city all street segments within mile of the nodes are assigned a value of

most vulnerable pedestrians all street segments within mile of elementary and middle schools are assigned a value of 1 e groceries & health clubs due to the current lack of regional commercial development in salisbury the majority of all grocery stores are still within the heaviest commercial nodes and adjacent to existing neighborhoods our largescale grocery stores still have the advantage of serving the public in a manner similar to smallscale convenience regarding health clubs salisbury recognizes the importance of healthful living and becoming a more active community accordingly all street segments within mile of groceries and health clubs have been assigned a value of 1 f medical facilities hospitals and smaller medical facilities in salisbury are large employment centers and two of which are located adjacent to wellestablished neighborhoods and transit facilities this characteristic generates a considerable amount of pedestrian activity and transit use accordingly all street segments within mile of these facilities have been assigned a value of 1 g presence of sidewalk the presence of existing sidewalk within a scoring roadway segment has been assigned a value of 1 this factor recognizes that completing a sidewalk network and providing continuity of facilities generally has greater value to pedestrians h thoroughfares thoroughfares are the most significant streets in a roadway system and provide direct access to many destinations in addition the speed and volume of motor vehicle traffic intensifies pedestrians need for separate facilities accordingly major and minor thoroughfares have been assigned a value of 1 scoring is determined along roadway segments  regardless of development or parcel size this prevents individual major pedestriangenerating projects from coincidentally falling outside of many of the scoring characteristics and avoiding installation in addition it ensures continuity of the sidewalk network between significant intersections railroad crossings or other important features the segment boundaries employed to determine the spi score that are first encountered in any combination shall be as follows 1 signalized

level standards the applicant shall be required to upgrade the facilities in accordance with the adopted level of service program mitigation measures may involve strategies other than roadway construction or other physical improvements such as changes to traffic signal timing or phasing and transportation management strategies d thresholds for mitigation the city requires consideration of roadway andor operational improvements when the proposed development increases the intersection volumetocapacity ratio vc beyond the thresholds indicated in the table below the city evaluates the impacts of proposed development at intersections primarily under existing year conditions based on the increase in vc ratio as a result of the projected site traffic this increase is determined by comparing the vc ratio under existing development conditions and proposed development conditions for the purposes of this comparison all unsignalized intersections are analyzed as signalized

general residential buildings types are as follows house townhouse and apartment including manufactured housing adjacent buildings should relate in similarity of scale roof pitch height architectural elements andor lot configuration 1 house a house is a detached building located on one 1 parcel or lot that is flexible in use accommodating singlefamily residences multifamily residences up to four units home occupations professional offices and limited retail uses based on the zoning district in which it is located the two basic house building types  streetaccess house and alleyaccess house  are a function of how the lot is accessed by automobile 2 townhouse a townhouse is one of a row of attached houses or livework units joined by common sidewalls and where each houseunit is located on an individual parcel or lot when an entrance is provided atgrade the townhouse may be used as a livework unit the use permitted within the building is determined by the district in which it is located the townhouse typically has 1 yard rear though variations include a small front setback to provide some landscaping 3 apartment a multipleunit building containing more than four 4 dwelling units vertically arranged generally the ground floor may be available for commercial uses the uses permitted within the building are determined by the district in which the building is located the apartment
