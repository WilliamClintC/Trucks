protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4 under the national pollutant discharge elimination system

transferred to different entities provided that there is compliance with the approved development plan and this  28531 5 procedures a applicants are strongly encouraged to first submit a layout plan with the conditional use application before completing detailed fullyengineered preliminary subdivision plans this twostep process will allow the township and applicant to mutually agree upon the

features map information described above the yield plan shall show potential lots streets and retentiondetention pond locations however the yield plan shall not serve as and is not required to contain the engineering detail requirements of a preliminary subdivision plan 3 such yield plan shall be reviewed by the zoning officer with advice by the township engineer to determine whether it represents a reasonably accurate estimate of the number of dwelling units possible on the site both physically and legally if such estimates are determined to not be accurate the applicant shall be required by the zoning officer to revise such yield plan until it is accurate a the maximum number of dwelling units allowed on the tract space development shall be 25% greater than the number of dwelling units that is determined by the township to be possible under the townshipaccepted yield plan b the allowed number of dwelling units may be rounded to the nearest whole number 4 for a tract of over 50 acres

open space in the future if the total allowed number of dwellings would be developed b the following hypothetical example assumes a tract includes 50 acres and the yield plan determines that the applicant for an open space development is allowed a total of 30 new dwellings in this example the applicant only wishes to subdivide lots for 10 new dwellings at the present time which is 13 of the total number of allowed dwellings at the present time only 13 of the open space would need to be preserved compared to if all of the allowed housing units would be developed however the preserved open space would need to be placed on the tract at a location where it could be joined by the remaining acres of land under a conservation easement if the applicant in the future decided to subdivide lots for the remaining 20 dwelling units that are allowed 8 a minimum of 50% of the required preserved open space shall be in one contiguous lot except that the preserved open space may be separated by

sensitive natural features b the permanent preservation of a substantial area of land in agricultural uses in a tract of proper size and configuration that allows for efficient agricultural use and

any such right remains from the quota allocated to the parent tract on  or on the date when such land was first included within the a district the right of further subdivision or establishment of principal uses shall also be included in the deed for the newly created lot if the designation of the right of further subdivision or establishment of principal uses was not included on a subdivision or land development plan of a parent tract it shall be conclusively presumed that the largest lot remaining after subdivision shall carry the right of further subdivision or establishment of principal uses 9 in the event that a tract which was not classified as part of the a district on  is or was thereafter classified as part of the a district the size and ownership of the tract and the

or 2 is generally unsuitable for agricultural purposes  or 3 where additional lot area is needed to improve septic or water supply facilities for the lot where an applicant proposes to subdivide an existing dwelling from the parent tract the applicant may opt to impose the maximum lot area requirements of this section upon such existing dwelling rather than on a proposed dwelling to be constructed on the remainder of the parent tract b the township may also allow one lot to exceed the twoacre maximum lot area if the applicant proves that the resulting land that is removed from the parent tract will not be greater than would result if a larger number of allowed lots would be subdivided for example if an applicant was allowed three new lots on a tract and only proposed one new lot then that one new lot could have a sixacre maximum lot area which is equivalent to three lots of two acres each however in this example that sixacre lot would be designated on deeds and the record plan as having the right to subdivide the two additional lots and the remaining parent lot would not have a right of further subdivision 3 other allowed uses unless otherwise specified all other principal uses shall contain at least one acre except as specifically stated in no case shall any nonagricultural use contain more than five acres 4 see  28563 which may allow a lot to include two

risk of transmission of other communicable diseases increases in blight decreases in the stability of residential neighborhoods and decreases in property values for surrounding homes and decreases in the marketability of nearby commercial business space the research conducted across the nation concludes that adult uses typically involve insufficient selfregulation to control these secondary effects  to limit adult uses to locations where these secondary impacts can be minimized particularly as they affect residential neighborhoods and commercial revitalization  to not attempt to suppress

an existing lawful use includes less parking than would be required if the use would be newly developed then that deficit of parking shall be grandfathered for reuses of an existing building for example an existing store might include three parking spaces and would have been required to provide six spaces if it was newly developed therefore there is an existing nonconforming deficit of four spaces then if that store is converted to an office that would need 10 spaces the office would need to provide a total of six spaces 10 spaces minus the preexisting deficit of four equals six 2 if a nonresidential use expands by an aggregate total maximum of 5% in the applicable measurement such as building floor area beyond what existed at the time of adoption of this chapter then no additional parking is required for example if an existing building included 3000 square feet and a single minor addition of 150 square feet was proposed then additional parking would not be required this

as studies of similar developments during their peak hours the applicant shall also provide relevant data such as numbers of employers peak expected number of customersvisitors and similar data b

based upon whether the different uses have different hours of peak demand andor overlapping customers  in addition an applicant may prove that parking needs will be reduced or that offsite parking is
