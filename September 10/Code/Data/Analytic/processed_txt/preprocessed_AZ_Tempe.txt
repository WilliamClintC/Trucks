and conditions of license will be deemed a breach of the license and this chapter to which the provisions of shall apply      fees costs and payments a for the reason that the streets and other public rightsofway which are used by the licensee in the operation of its video services system within the boundaries of the city are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the city at great expense to its taxpayers and that the grant to the licensee to the use of said streets is a valuable property right without which the licensee would be required to invest substantial capital in

be determined from the sum of the lowest standalone rates available to a subscriber or class of subscribers for each of the goods and services which are offered at the combined rate as follows assume a subscribers charges for a given month for video services alone would be eighty dollars $8000 for local telephone service alone sixty dollars $6000 and for internet service alone sixty dollars $6000 for a total of two hundred $20000 if a licensee offers the three 3 services at a combined rate of one hundred sixty dollars $16000 ie the subscriber in effect receives a twenty percent 20% discount from the regular retail rates that would apply to the services if purchased individually for license fee computation gross revenues from video services would be deemed to be forty eight dollars $4800 sixty dollars $6000 less twenty percent 20% 2 assume the same facts as in the preceding example except that the subscriber also purchases optional packages or premium video channels at a fixed fee of thirty dollars $3000 a month that is not included in the bundled service offering the discount ie the discount does not apply to this service for a total of one hundred ninety $19000 one hundred sixty dollars $16000 bundle offer plus thirty dollars $3000 gross revenues would be seventy eight dollars $7800 forty eight dollars $4800 from the prior example of bundled services plus the undiscounted

prohibition the statute required certain designated federal agencies to develop implementingregulations known as the ada accessibility guidelines adaag the guidelines and standards contained within the adaag arecontinually being updated and refined and current versions should be reviewed as part of the design process for every project crime prevention through environmental design cpted safe environments and pedestrian activity are interrelated and onecannot exist without the other therefore building designs should support pedestrian activity and provide natural surveillance ofspaces from key locations inside and next to buildings this should be accomplished appropriate design and placement ofwindows entrances pedestrian amenities lighting outdoor rooms eg balconies arcades and similar features and activity supportbuildings should incorporate entrances windows balconies and activities allowing visibility of the street parking areas and entrancesfrom inside buildings  and visibility of building entrances and other public gathering spaces from the street as generally shown belowlighting must conform to the provisions of the cpted principles are natural surveillance natural surveillance is the cpted concept that encourages an open design it promotes opportunities for people as they areengaged in their normal behaviors to observe the space around them this principle allows people to feel comfortable as they use a space maintain distance from intruders that may be in or near thespace and encourage observation of those individuals that may be using the space with criminal intent natural surveillance encourages the design and placement of physical features so as to maximize visibility this includes buildingorientation placement of windows building and site entrance and exit locations refuse containers landscape materials parkinglots walkways walls and fences including the use of wrought iron and similar materials that promote visibility signage and otherphysical obstructions it may also include the placement of persons or activities to maximize surveillance possibilities minimally maintained lighting standards that provide for nighttime illumination of parking lots walkways entrances exits andrelated areas to promote a safe environment are also natural surveillance components of good cpted design access control access control is the cpted principle directed at decreasing criminal accessibility this principle is especially important whereintruders will not be easily observed fences walls and actual building location on a site are primary considerations to accesscontrol however provisions of access control must encourage the use of natural surveillance where practical to restrict criminalintrusion into an area intruders are more readily recognized proper location and use sidewalks pavement variations gates lighting signagefencing landscape and other techniques used to clearly guide the public to and from activity areas and are primary to effectiveaccess control activity support activity support involves the placement on activities where the individuals engaged in those activities become part of the naturalsurveillance and access control systems examples include placement of safe activities in areas so as to discourage would be offenders the goal is to increase the likelihood of good naturalsurveillance and the perception of safety for normal users and the perception of risk for the offenders placement of highrisk activities in safer locations to overcome the vulnerability associated with these activities use ofgood natural surveillance and access control techniques the location of gathering areas in places that provides good natural surveillance and access control territoriality territoriality is the cpted principle that is used to clearly delineate private space from semiprivate and public spaces properlyused it creates a sense of ownership in private and semiprivate areas territoriality creates an environment where strangers and intruders stand out and are more easily identified this is accomplishedthrough the effective use of signage grade changes fencing landscape edging lighting and any number of imaginative techniquesthat encourage individuals to take pride in their surroundings and report criminal activity   pm tempe az zoning and

parking demand for a particular mix of uses on asite the model assumes that every separate use will actually need the full amount of parking that is called for by the ratios in theordinance at some point called the peak period for the use during the day for example in the real world some uses like nightclubspeak in the evening  others like offices peak in the morning or afternoon where different uses need parking at different times of theday there is an opportunity for them to share parking this means that the total number of stalls needed to serve a mixed use site theparking demand may be significantly less than the number of stalls that would have to be built if each of the uses had to provideparking on its own the parking required by this  the standard shared parking model is a tool for estimating the parking demand of a specific mix of uses it is called standard becauseeach of the demand curves represents the parking needed for an average typical use based on studies and observations collected bystaff over a number of years the curves are represented below as a table showing the percent of the for such usesby hour of day these curves can be adapted to fit the specific needs of a major tenant on the site the advantage of doing this is that the mode will bemore accurate in predicting that tenants share of the parking throughout the day the disadvantage is that the model will be uniqueand may not work as well if that tenant is replaced by an average typical user in the future in addition to changing the curves onemight also consider the impact of transit availability reliable mass transit serving the site trip reduction programs van and carpoolingetc and captive market effects where users serve patrons who are already on site as well as any users who might need more parkingthan the require any modifications to the standard model should be based on a professional parking analysis andmanagement study as described in a companion information sheet
