c518 article i general provisions  2451 short title this chapter shall be known as the radnor township stormwater management   2452 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces ground water recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens ground water resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater can be an important water resource by providing ground water recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality ground water recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most costeffective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design that minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl avoids sensitive areas ie stream buffers floodplains steep slopes and considers topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime  2451 charter  2452 c519  2453 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within the municipality by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and minimizing the impacts described in  2452 of this chapter designed to f public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater g federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes h nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the municipality a promote alternative project designs and layouts that minimize the impacts on surface and ground water b promote nonstructural best management practices bmps c minimize increases in runoff stormwater volume d minimize impervious surfaces e manage accelerated stormwater runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems and stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems f provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management g utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems as much as possible h manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source requiring a minimum of structures and relying on natural processes i focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain ground water recharge to prevent degradation of surface and ground water quality and to otherwise protect water resources j maintain existing baseflows and quality of streams and watercourses k meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25

findings a the stormwater management needs of radnor have been identified notifications field investigations and in studies conducted by amec environment and infrastructure inc chagrin valley engineering and many other engineering studies and findings indicating more comprehensive and effective stormwater management in radnor would contribute to the protection of the health safety and welfare of the residents and that stormwater facilities infrastructure and activities associated with stormwater management provide services and benefits to all properties property owners residents and citizens of radnor b inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff throughout a watershed 1 can increase flood flows and velocities  2 contribute to erosion and sedimentation  3 overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers  4 greatly increase the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater  5 undermine floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities  6 reduce groundwater recharge  7 impact other related water resource needs  and 8 threaten public health and safety c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff throughout a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural  24551 charter  2462 c587 hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources can also be impacted of recharge stormwater is an important water resource which supports groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams d a comprehensive program of public stormwater management services which seeks to avoid and minimize flooding erosion and water quality degradation is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare of the residents of radnor local property and the environment e in order to establish operate enhance and maintain the stormwater infrastructure of radnor  insure the continued effective operation of the system management of best practices  and to provide other services such as appropriate inspections asset management and regulatory oversight associated with stormwater and watershed management
