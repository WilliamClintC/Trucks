works may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with e of this section b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director of public works may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard

limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director of public works the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in 1a e of this section below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an

to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the director of public works whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in 1c of this section upon notification of a revised  18406 salisbury code  18406 fwd406 production rate the director of public works will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to 1a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the director of public works a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to of this section the industrial user must also be in compliance with  18417 regarding the prohibition of bypass e the director of public works may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the director of public works  18406 foreword  18406 fwd407

title 22200  101 this be known and may be cited as the saucon creek watershed act 167 stormwater management   26202 statement of findings 22200  102 1 the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation changes the natural hydrologic patterns destroys aquatic habitat elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater e federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these

divided into stormwater management districts consistent with the saucon creek release rate map presented in the plan update the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the municipal office a copy of the official map at a reduced scale is included in appendix a for general reference40 2 description of stormwater management districts two types of stormwater management districts may be applicable to the municipality namely conditionalprovisional no detention districts and dual release rate districts as described below a conditionalprovisional no detention districts within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities as defined in  26211 must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists for this determination the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing condition the developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists if adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel as defined in  26211 these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities if the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with  26226 any capacity 40editors note appendix a is on file in the township offices  26224 salisbury code  26225 fwd726  26226 stormwater management district implementation provisions 22200  306 improvements must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in  26224 by definition a storm drainage problem area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist sites in these districts are still required to meet all of the water quality requirements in  26224 b dual release rate districts within these districts the twoyear postdevelopment peak discharge must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment twoyear runoff peak further the ten twentyfive and onehundredyear postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak release rates associated with the ten hundredyear events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed 1 applicants shall provide a comparative pre and postconstruction stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this any stormwater management controls required by this subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two ten twentyfive and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in  26227 3 the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines 4 any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates a natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion  26225 foreword  26226 fwd727 b natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property c culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and at minimum pass the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff 5 for a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple directions of runoff discharge individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate 6 for a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site in this case peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate 7 for a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and partially within a conditionalprovisional no detention subarea the size of the predevelopment drainage area on a site may not be changed postdevelopment to create potentially adverse conditions on downstream properties except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure 8 no portion of a site may be regraded between the saucon creek watershed and any adjacent watershed except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure 9 within a release rate category area for a proposed development site which has areas which drain to a closed depressions the design release from the site will be the lesser of a the applicable release rate flow assuming no closed depressions or b the existing peak flow actually leaving the site in cases where b would result in an unreasonably small design release the design discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined by the available downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using  26226 the minimum orifice criteria 10 offsite areas which drain proposed development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates however onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite flows development site using the capacity  26226 salisbury code  26226 fwd728 criteria in  26226 the detention criteria in  26227 11 for development sites proposed to take place in phases all detention ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rates applied to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction all site tributary areas will be assumed as developed regardless of whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that time an exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated release rate 12 where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the release rate criteria the impact area includes any proposed cover or grading changes 13 development proposals which recharge or other means do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the release rate provisions of this no harm water quantity option a for any proposed development site not located in a conditional provisional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control strategy proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the delaware or lehigh river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in  26226 if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification b attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions 1 the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms two ten twentyfive and onehundred year shall be the values from the calibrated psrm model for the saucon creek watershed or as calculated by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the municipality the flow values from the psrm model would be supplied to the developer by the municipality upon request  26226 foreword  26226 fwd729 2 any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity 3 developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with  26226 c any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per subpart d developers submitting no harm justifications must still meet all of the water quality requirements in  26224 15 regional detention alternatives for certain areas within the study area it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required release rate at the point of discharge 16 capacity improvements a in certain instances primarily within the conditionalprovisional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site peak flow calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls any capacity improvements would be designed using the

municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation changes the natural hydrologic patterns destroys aquatic habitat elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality44 d public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater45 e federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of

they meet the minimum requirements of and do not conflict with state law including but not limited to the clean streams law 1 mapping of stormwater management districts to implement the provisions of the little lehigh creek watershed stormwater management plan the municipality is hereby divided into stormwater management districts consistent with the little lehigh creek release rate map presented in the plan the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the municipal office a copy of the official map at a reduced scale is included in appendix a for general reference74 2 description of stormwater management districts two types of stormwater management districts may be applicable to the municipality namely conditional no detention districts and dual release rate districts as described below a conditional no detention districts within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities as defined in subpart b must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists for this determination the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing condition the developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists if adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel as defined in subpart b these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities if the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with  26426 any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in  26426 by definition a storm drainage problem area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist 74editors note appendix a is on file in the township offices  26424 salisbury code  26425 fwd784  26426 stormwater management district implementation provisions 28200  306 b dual release rate districts within this district the twoyear postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment twoyear runoff peak further the tenyear twentyfiveyear and onehundredyear postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak release rates associated with the tenthrough onehundredyear events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed 1 applicants shall provide a comparative pre and postconstruction stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this any stormwater management controls required by this subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two ten twentyfive and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in  26427 3 the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines 4 any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates a natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyearreturnperiod event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion b natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyearreturnperiod runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property c culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and  26425 foreword  26426 fwd785 at minimum pass the increased twentyfiveyearreturnperiod runoff 5 for a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple directions of runoff discharge individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate 6 for a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site in this case peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate 7 for a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and partially within a conditional no detention subarea a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate control may not be drained to the discharge points located in the no detention subarea except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure 8 no portion of a site may be regraded between the little lehigh creek watershed and any adjacent watershed except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure 9 within a release rate category area for a proposed development site which has areas which drain to a closed depressions the design release from the site will be the lesser of a the applicable release rate flow assuming no closed depressions or b the existing peak flow actually leaving the site in cases where b would result in an unreasonably small design release the design discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined by the available downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using  26426 the minimum orifice criteria 10 offsite areas which drain proposed development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates however onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite flows development site using the capacity criteria in  26426 the detention criteria in  26427 11 for development sites proposed to take place in phases all detention ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rates applied to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction all site tributary areas will be assumed as developed regardless of  26426 salisbury code  26426 fwd786 whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that time an exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated release rate 12 where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the release rate criteria the impact area includes any proposed cover or grading changes 13 development proposals which recharge or other means do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the release rate provisions of this no harm water quantity option a for any proposed development site not located in a conditional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control strategy proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the lehigh river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in  26426 if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification b attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions 1 the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms two ten twentyfive and onehundred year shall be the values from the calibrated watershed model for the little lehigh creek or as calculated by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the municipality the flow values from the watershed model would be supplied to the developer by the municipality upon request 2 any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity  26426 foreword  26426 fwd787  26427 calculation methodology 28200  307 3 developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with  26426 c any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per subpart d 15 regional detention alternatives for certain areas within the study area it may be more cost effective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required release rate at the point of discharge 16 capacity improvements a in certain instances primarily within the conditional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site peak flow calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in all new development in the entire subareas within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any b capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm

governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation changes the natural hydrologic patterns destroys aquatic habitat elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater e federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge

management districts may be applicable to the municipality namely conditionalprovisional no detention districts and dual release rate districts as described below a conditionalprovisional no detention districts within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities as defined in  26511 must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists for this determination the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing condition the developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists if adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel as defined in  26511 these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities if the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows 105 editors note appendix a is on file in the township offices  26524 salisbury code  26525

adequate capacity does not exist sites in these districts are still required to meet all of the water quality requirements in  26524 b dual release rate districts within these districts the twoyear postdevelopment peak discharge must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment twoyear runoff peak further the ten twentyfive and onehundredyear postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak release rates associated with the ten hundredyear events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed 1 applicants shall provide a

stormwater management controls required by this subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two ten twentyfive and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in  26527 3 the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines

must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyear return period event  26525 foreword  26526 fwd843 within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion b natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property c culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and at minimum pass the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff 5 for a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple directions of runoff discharge individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate 6 for a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site in this case peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate 7 for a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and partially within a conditionalprovisional no detention subarea the size of the predevelopment drainage area on a site may not be changed postdevelopment to create potentially adverse conditions on downstream properties except as part of a no

procedure 9 within a release rate category area for a proposed development site which has areas which drain to a closed depressions the design release from the site will be the lesser of a the applicable release rate flow assuming no closed depressions or b the existing peak flow actually leaving the site in cases where b would result in an unreasonably small design release the design discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined by the available downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using  26526 the minimum orifice criteria  26526

be subject to the release rate criteria the impact area includes any proposed cover or grading changes 13 development proposals which recharge or other means do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the release rate provisions of this no harm water quantity option a for any proposed development site not located in a conditional provisional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control strategy proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the delaware or lehigh river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in  26526 if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification b attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions 1

his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity 3 developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with  26526 c any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per subpart d developers submitting no harm justifications must still meet all of the water quality requirements in  26524 15 regional detention alternatives for certain areas within the study area it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required release rate at the point of discharge 16 capacity improvements a in certain instances primarily within the conditionalprovisional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site peak flow calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls any capacity improvements would be designed using the

moredetailed study sufficient information shall be provided to the township for a thorough review 2 all permits of the township are issued on the condition that the applicant complies with federal and state wetlands regulations and such permits may be revoked or suspended by the zoning officer for noncompliance with such regulations 3 seeps vernal pools and springs in any area suspected of possibly including a spring vernal pools or seep the applicant shall have field research conducted on the property to identify and map any seeps or springs 4 setbacks a minimum setback of 50 feet shall be

require an applicant to perform a study of the extent of the onehundredyear floodplain along an alluvial soil area intermittent stream channel or swale where the onehundredyear floodplain was not officially delineated previously in areas determined to be subject to a onehundredyear flood the same township regulations shall apply as if the area had been previously officially delineated as being within the onehundredyear floodplain 2 purpose of setbacks to protect the water quality of surface waterways preserve physical access to surface waters in case of future public acquisition minimize erosion and sedimentation preserve the natural stormwater drainage system of the area conserve sensitive wildlife and aquatic habitats preserve vegetation along waterways that will help screen out eroded soil and other pollutants and provide for setbacks that can be used as required yard areas for a use 3 setbacks from surface waterways no building offstreet parking or commercial or industrial storage or display area shall be located within  27503 salisbury code  27504 fwd1038 100 feet of the top edge of the primary bank of a major surface waterway and 75 feet of the top edge of a minor

made to leave the setback areas of this section undisturbed except at approved approximately perpendicular crossings 6 vegetation within a setback required under the applicant shall describe natural vegetation and trees that will be removed or replaced where trees and natural vegetation are removed within such setback the applicant shall plant new trees and other vegetation that will serve the same or better environmental effect to avoid erosion and to filter pollutants from runoff 7 high water table soils a at the time of review of a proposed subdivision or land development the zoning officer may require that an onsite investigation be conducted for the purpose of determining the location of a high water table if any of the following conditions exist 1 soil mapping of the united states natural resources conservation service or a morereliable source indicates that the area includes soils with a seasonal depth to water table of less than three feet below the surface  2 wetlands are present on the property  or 3 there are other visual indicators of the presence of a high water table b the township may require that test excavations be subject to observation by a representative from the township the determination of areas with high water table shall be made by a qualified soil scientist or other professional who is acceptable to the township c areas that are to be permanently restricted against use for any buildings or parking easement or deed restriction are not required to be tested  27504 foreword  27504 fwd1039  27505 steep slopes d the lowest enclosed floor of a new principal building including any basement shall be built a minimum of six inches above the seasonal high water table elevation any new principal building shall be constructed to limit the need for groundwater pumping 1 purposes this section is intended to serve the following purposes to avoid problems that typically accompany development of steeply sloped and adjacent areas a to avoid severe soil erosion and sedimentation especially considering that most of the areas affected by this section have a severe vulnerability to erosion based upon information provided by the united states natural resources conservation service b to avoid severely increased stormwater flows and speeds especially recognizing the existing severe stormwater problems and overloaded sanitary sewer systems from stormwater infiltration downhill from most of the areas affected by this section and especially recognizing the difficulty of regulating stormwater control on small developments and single lot construction and the severe aggregate stormwater impact of numerous such small developments c to recognize the recommendations of the lehigh valley planning commissions comprehensive plan for lehigh and northampton counties regarding natural feature conservation d to steer development to those areas that are more physically suited for it e to avoid construction of steep roads that are difficult timeconsuming and expensive for maintenance and snow removal f to avoid increased use of steep roads and driveways that are dangerous to drive upon in snow and ice and in wet conditions g to recognize that although there are areas that are not steep within the cr district it usually is necessary to develop adjacent steep areas in order to develop the nonsteep areas h to seek to conserve forested areas that are an important part of the ecological cycle providing for groundwater recharge air pollution reduction and wildlife habitats i to recognize that many of the areas affected by this section include natural springs wetlands and major drainage channels that are very important parts of the hydrological cycle to protect water quality water quantity aquatic habitats and public water supplies including the little lehigh creek and allentowns crystal spring  27504 salisbury code  27505 fwd1040 j to allow each property owner a reasonable use of their land related directly to the natural features and location and accessibility of the land k to recognize that the township has allowed and continues to allow and direct a reasonable amount of intense growth in more physically suitable portions of the township this especially includes areas where public sewer service is efficiently available thereby using less total land to accommodate the same number of dwelling units than if such development occurred in areas without public water service l to base the permitted intensity of development upon the physical characteristics of a parcel to support development especially the steepness of slopes m to recognize that development of many of the lesssteep areas affected by this section would require increased use of existing steep roads that are not suitable for intense traffic because of slope limited sight distance horizontal and vertical alignment problems and limited width and that it would be difficult to improve these roads to an acceptable level because of the cost presence of wetlands limited rightofway and steep slopes n to recognize that many of the areas affected by this section are difficult to efficiently serve with community facilities and services because of distances involved steepness of roads and inaccessibility including the following services fire truck access emergency medical response police response active recreation facilities school busing street maintenance snow plowing and public water supply o to recognize that most of the areas affected by this section are not served by a public water system  this limits amounts of water available for firefighting p to minimize the necessity for state municipal and private expenditures to correct soil erosion subsidence and sedimentation problems q to recognize that the trout creek and little lehigh creek already suffer from severe silting problems after heavy rains r to recognize that the open space option in  27310 provides an opportunity for economical development of a tract by clustering the units on the lesssteep areas thereby lowering construction grading road and improvement costs s to recognize that central sewage service is not expected to be available in the majority of the cr district and that onlot septic systems frequently have a higher rate of failure on steep areas than lesssteep areas  27505 foreword  27505 fwd1041 2 definition of construction area
