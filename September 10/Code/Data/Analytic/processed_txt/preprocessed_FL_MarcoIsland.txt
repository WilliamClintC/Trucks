provide for the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city regulation of potential pollution from construction activities these activities would include connections or areas not connected to the citys ms4 system 1 no building permit shall be issued for any building in the city unless a site plan is submitted with the application for such building permit illustrating the location of driveways sidewalks if required by this code parking strips consistent with this code and perimeter retaining structures or a surface water management plan which provides for containment of runoff onsite with surplus routed to rightsofway or rightofway swales for drainage as applicable 2 site plans for construction projects in all zoning districts shall be reviewed and administratively approved by staff for onsite erosion control per applicable code provisions outlined herein appropriate erosion control devices must be planned implemented and maintained in accordance with the best management practices bmps described in the florida department of environmental protections erosion & sediment control designer & reviewer manual most current edition and required as part of any permit review approval and compliance if approved bmps are not working properly it is the responsibility of the developer or contractor to utilize new bmp methods as necessary to provide erosion and sediment control b erosion and sediment control construction activity can result in the generation of significant amounts of pollutants which may reach surface or ground waters one of the primary pollutants of surface waters is sediment due to erosion excessive quantities of sediment which reach water bodies of floodplains have been shown to adversely affect their physical biological and chemical properties transported sediment can obstruct stream channels reduce the hydraulic capacity of water bodies of floodplains reduce the design capacity of culverts and other works and eliminate benthic invertebrates and fish spawning substrates by siltation excessive suspended sediments reduce light penetration and therefore reduce primary productivity therefore the minimum standards set forth in subsection c below shall apply to any construction activity within the city c minimum standards the minimum standards referenced in subsection b include 1 sediment basins and traps perimeter dikes sediment barriers and other measures intended to trap sediment shall be constructed as a first step in any landdisturbing activity and shall be made functional before upslope land disturbance takes place  2 all sediment control measures are to be adjusted to meet field conditions at the time of construction and be constructed prior to any grading or disturbance of existing surface material on the balance of site perimeter sediment barriers shall be constructed to prevent sediment or trash from flowing or floating on to adjacent properties  3 permanent or temporary soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas within seven days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site where practicable temporary soil stabilization shall be applied within seven days to denuded areas that may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than 30 days permanent stabilization shall be applied to areas that are to be left undisturbed for more than 90 days  4 during construction of a project soil stock piles shall be stabilized or protected with sediment trapping measures the developer is responsible for the temporary protection and permanent stabilization of all soil stockpiles on site as well as soil intentionally transported from the project site  5 a permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a ground cover is achieved that in the opinion of the citys reviewer is uniform and mature enough to survive and will inhibit erosion  6 stabilization measures shall be applied to earthen structures such as dams dikes and diversions immediately after installation  7 after any significant rainfall sediment control structures will be inspected for integrity any damaged devices shall be corrected immediately  8 concentrated runoff shall not flow down cut or fill slopes unless contained within an adequate temporary or permanent channel flume or slope drain structure  9 whenever water seeps from a slope face adequate drainage or other protection shall be provided  10 sediment will be prevented from entering any storm drain system ditch or channel all storm sewer inlets that are made operable during construction shall be protected so that sedimentladen water cannot enter the conveyance system

constructed of nonerodible material shall be provided  14 the bed and banks of a watercourse shall be stabilized immediately after work in the watercourse is completed  15 periodic inspection and maintenance of all sediment control structures must be provided to ensure the intended purpose is accomplished the developer shall be continually responsible for all sediment leaving the property sediment control measures shall be in working condition at the end of each working day  16 underground utility lines shall be installed in accordance with the following standards in addition to other applicable criteria a no more than 500 linear feet of trench may be opened at one time  b excavated material shall be placed on the uphill side of trenches  c effluent from dewatering operations shall be filtered or passed approved sediment trapping device or both and discharged in a manner that does not adversely affect flowing streams or offsite property  and d restabilization shall be accomplished in accordance with these regulations  17 where construction vehicle access routes intersect paved public roads provisions shall be made to minimize the transport of sediment by tracking onto the paved surface where sediment is transported onto a public road surface with curbs and gutters the road shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each work day sediment shall be removed from the roads by shoveling or sweeping and transported to a sediment control disposal area street washing shall be allowed only after sediment is removed in this manner this provision shall apply to individual subdivision lots as well as to larger landdisturbing activities  18 all temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be removed within 30 days after final site stabilization or after the temporary measures are no longer needed in the opinion of the citys reviewer disturbed soil areas resulting from the disposition of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and sedimentation  19 properties and waterways downstream from construction sites shall be protected from sediment deposition and erosion  20 phased projects should be cleared in conjunction with construction of each phase  21 the city permit reviewer may approve modifications or alternate plans to these erosion control criteria due to site specific conditions d development of an erosion and sediment control plan an erosion and sediment control plan must be submitted as part of the building permit application that include land disturbing activities this plan and its implementation is a way of providing reasonable assurance that water quality standards will not be violated during the construction phase of a project the plan must identify the location relative timing and specifications for all erosion and sediment control and stabilization measures that will be implemented as part of the projects construction this plan can be prepared on a site planplot plan depicting the improvements proposed the plan must illustrate methods that would provide reasonable assurances that no offsite discharges of pollutants will be allowed said plan shall be prepared by a state licensed professional engineer the preparer will certify the plans to and for reliance by the city with the submittal that they are familiar with state stormwater best management practices

development must contribute its fair share toward the costs of funding improvements and additions to such facilities 3 implementation of an impact fee to require future development to contribute its fair share of the cost of improvements and additions to the water and wastewater facilities is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management by the city 4 the level of service standards for the water and wastewater facilities as adopted in the city of marco island comprehensive plan and utility master plans as may hereafter be adopted and amended from time to time are controlling upon this division and are incorporated throughout this division 5 capital planning is an evolving process and the level of service standards for the water and wastewater facilities

of population growth it is the intent of the city that the level of service standards system capacity and required capacity expansions for the water and wastewater facilities and the impact fee imposed should be reviewed and adjusted periodically to try to ensure that the impact fees are imposed equitably and lawfully and are based upon actual and anticipated growth at the time of their imposition 6 the imposition of the impact fee is to provide a source of revenue to fund the construction or improvement of the water and wastewater facilities necessitated by growth 7 the city council

demand on the water and wastewater facilities to contribute its proportionate share of the funds land or water and wastewater facilities to accommodate any impacts having a rational nexus to the proposed development and for which the need is reasonably attributable to the proposed development  and 5 ensure that no funds land or water and wastewater facilities are collected from new development in excess of the actual amount reasonably determined necessary to offset the demand on the water and wastewater facilities generated by new development this division is intended to be consistent with the principles applied to allocate a fair share of the cost of new water and wastewater facilities to new users and new development as established in florida statutes or applicable

applicable to all multislip docking facilities with ten slips or more and all marina facilities b manatee protection 1 proposed developments will be reviewed for consistency with the manatee protection plan mpp adopted by the collier county board of county commissioners and approved by the state department of environmental protection if the location of the proposed development is consistent with the mpp then the developer will submit a manatee awareness and protection plan which shall address but not be limited to the following categories a education and public awareness  b posting and maintaining manatee awareness signs  c information on type and destination of boat traffic that will be generated from the facility  d monitoring and maintenance of water quality to comply with state standards  e marking of navigational channels may be required c marina siting 1 the purpose of the marina site rating system is to help determine the maximum wet slip densities in order to improve existing manatee protection the marina site rating system gives a ranking based on three criteria  water depth native marine habitat and manatee abundance in evaluating a parcel for a potential boat facility a minimum sphere of influence for the boat traffic must be designated for this plan an onwater travel distance of five miles is considered the sphere of influence 2 rating criteria a a preferred rating is given to a site that has or legally create adequate water depth and access will not impact native marine habitats and will not impact a high manatee use area see table 1 b a moderate ranking is given to a site where  there is an adequate water depth and access no impact to a high manatee use area but there is an impact to native marine habitat  there is adequate water depth no impact to native marine habitat but impacts a high manatee use area  and when the water depth is less than four feet mean low water mlw no impact to native marine habitat and no impact to a high manatee use area c a protected ranking is given to a site where  there is adequate water depth and access but there is an impact to native marine habitat and there is an impact to a high manatee use area  there is not adequate water depth there is impact to or destruction of native marine habitat and there is impact to a high manatee use area  there is not adequate water depth no impact to marine habitat but there is impact to a high manatee use area  or there is not adequate depth there is impact to marine habitat and no impact to a high manatee use area d the exact areas will depend on site specific data gathered during the site development process table 1 water depth native marine habitat manatee use greater than 4 mlw less than 4 mlw no impact impact not high high preferred x x x moderate x x x moderate x x x moderate x x x protected x x x protected x x x protected x x x protected x x x for shoreline vegetation such as mangroves no impact is defined as no greater than five percent of the native marine habitat is disturbed for sea grasses no impact means that no more than 100 square feet of sea grasses can be impacted d allowable wet slip densities 1 preferred sites new or expanded wet slip marinas and multifamily facilities shall be allowed at a density of up to 18 boat slips for every 100 feet of shoreline expansion of existing and construction of new dry storage facilities is allowed expansion of existing and construction of new boat ramps is allowed 2 moderate development sites new or expanded wet slips and multifamily facilities shall be allowed at a density of up to ten boat slips for every 100 feet of shoreline expansion of existing dry storage facilities is allowed construction of new dry storage facilities is prohibited expansion of existing boat ramps is allowed construction of existing boat ramps is allowed construction of new boat ramps is prohibited 3 protected site new or expanded wet slip marinas and multifamily facilities shall be allowed at a density of one boat slip for every 100 feet of shoreline expansion of existing dry storage facilities or construction of new dry storage facilities is prohibited expansion of existing boat ramp or construction of new boat ramps is prohibited 4 mitigation if a potential boat facility site is ranked as moderate or protected because of its proximity to a high use manatee area its ranking can be increased if slow speed zones are established that account for a significant portion of the expected travel route of the boats using the proposed facility in that case the manatee criteria in the threeway test see table 1 would not affect the outcome of the ranking if such slow speed zones are not existing the city or county may establish with dep approval additional slow speed zones in order to mitigate the proposed additional boat traffic 5 implementation this rating system does not preclude the existing zoning and density regulations required by the current land development code this system shall be used to determine the allowable maximum powerboat wet slip densities within future marina sites for the purpose of manatee protection these criteria will be applied at the appropriate point in the city permitting process 6 exemption existing facilities and facilities which had state or federal permits prior to adoption of the county manatee protection plan shall be exempt from these provisions but will be subject to all other requirements of the ldc  4172000   932003 penalties for violation a pursuant to fs  16222 a person found to be in
