3232 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams the use of green infrastructure gi and lowimpact development lid are intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to 1 infiltrate and recharge  2 evapotranspire  andor 3 harvest and use precipitation near where it falls to earth green infrastructure practices and lid contribute to the restoration or maintenance of predevelopment hydrology federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities
