potential water supplies  to protect the public health and safety  to protect persons and property against the hazards of floodwater inundation  and to provide for the reasonable protection and conservation of certain irreplaceable natural features resources and amenities for the benefit and welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the town of south hadley amended 1102018 stm by art 7 a accordingly this bylaw protects the wetlands water resources and adjoining land areas in the town of south hadley by providing prior review and control of activities deemed by the conservation commission hereinafter the commission to have significant or cumulative detrimental effect upon the following resource area values these values collectively the resource area values protected by this bylaw include but are not limited to 1 protection of public or private water supply 2 protection of groundwater 3 flood control 4 erosion and sedimentation control 5 storm damage prevention 6 prevention of water pollution protection of fisheries and wildlife habitat and rare species habitat including rare plant species 7 8 recreation and agriculture values b this bylaw is intended to utilize the home rule authority of this municipality to protect additional resource areas with additional standards and procedures to augment those of the wetlands protection act mgl c 131  40 and regulations thereunder 310 cmr 1000 c  2374 south hadley code  2402   2402 jurisdiction in accordance with the above purpose no person shall commence to remove fill dredge build upon degrade pollute discharge into or otherwise alter the following resource areas any freshwater wetlands including marshes wet meadows bogs and swamps  vernal pools  banks  the water column of and the land under lakes ponds reservoirs creeks rivers and streams  lands within 100 feet of any of the aforesaid resource areas the buffer zone  isolated and bordering lands subject to flooding or inundation by groundwater or surface water  and the twohundred foot riverfront areas without a permit from the commission or as provided in this bylaw said resource areas shall be protected whether or not they border surface water a any activity proposed or undertaken within the aforesaid onehundredfoot buffer zone is subject to regulation under this bylaw buffer zones are vital in protecting the resource area values of this bylaw in many ways including but not limited to slowing water flow thereby decreasing water velocities allowing infiltration providing flood control and reducing the erosion potential of stormwater runoff  1 trapping sediment and other insoluble pollutants thereby decreasing or preventing pollution of the wetlands and water bodies  2 reducing nutrient overloading by filtering nutrients bound to sediment in the surface flow and removing nutrients from groundwater in vegetation  3 providing permeable soils that contribute to groundwater recharge  4 producing leaf litter and biomass which increases the humus content of the soil and increase in absorption and infiltration  5 scattering sunlight and providing shade thereby lowering water temperature within wetlands and water bodies  6 7 providing essential habitat for wetlandassociated species  and providing a visual separation between wetlands and developed environments 8 b lands within 100 feet of specific resource areas are presumed to be important to the protection of these resources because activities undertaken in close proximity to wetlands and other resources have a high likelihood of adverse impact upon the wetland or other resource either immediately as a consequence of construction or over time as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities these adverse impacts from construction and use can include without c  2402 general provisions  2402   2403 conservation zone limitation erosion siltation loss of groundwater degraded poor water quality and loss of wildlife habitat intermittent streams are important for storm damage prevention flood control groundwater protection wildlife habitat and recreation values during the spring summer and fall these streams disperse snow melt and storm runoff across the landscape thereby preventing dangerous volumes and flows from spilling over roadways and property this broad dispersal also allows for larger volumes of water to infiltrate into the ground recharging groundwater supplies intermittent streams are an essential source of food and water for wildlife and are often the only source of water in higher elevations in town during all seasons but especially in winter and spring intermittent streams act as essential corridors for animal movement especially when food is scarce accordingly this bylaw protects intermittent streams and their associated bordering vegetated wetlands d the commission shall presume that all areas meeting the definition of vernal pools under  24012 of this bylaw and the adjacent upland area perform essential habitat functions this presumption may be overcome only by the presentation of credible evidence which in the judgment of the commission demonstrates that the basin or depression does not provide essential vernal pool habitat functions any formal evaluation should be performed by an individual meeting the qualifications under the wildlife habitat section of the wetlands protection act regulations e the commission shall require that a fiftyfootwide strip of undisturbed vegetation called the conservation zone be maintained adjacent to any freshwater wetland bank or water body but not including lands subject to flooding or inundation by groundwater or surface water and the twohundredfoot riverfront area no work structures or alterations will be allowed within the conservation zone except for minor activities such as mowing gardening and pruning within existing lawn garden or landscaped areas as described in the regulations adopted by the commission the conservation zone shall not apply to artificially created stormwater management structures such as detention and retention basins artificially lined ponds and constructed wastewater treatment lagoons a the conservation zone for vernal pools will be based on the size of the basin  with a twentyfivefoot setback of undisturbed vegetation for vernal pools less than 10000 square feet and a fiftyfoot setback of undisturbed vegetation for vernal pools 10000 square feet or greater in size b where the conservation zone is already altered in such a manner that the presumed protection offered by the buffer zone is not being met the commission may issue an order of conditions for a project c  2402 south hadley code  2403   2404 exemptions and exceptions provided that it finds that the proposed alterations will not increase adverse impacts on that specific portion of the conservation zone or associated wetland resource areas and that there is no technically feasible construction alternative in such cases the commission may modify the scope and detail of the proposed project to minimize impact on or improve protection of the values protected by this bylaw the application and permit required by this bylaw shall not be required for maintaining repairing remodeling but not substantially changing or enlarging an existing and lawfully located singlefamily residential structure or customary appurtenance thereto as long as the footprint of any proposed addition is not any closer to the wetland or other resource areas than the existing structure and there is no reasonable alternate location on the owners property for the new structure that is further from the resource areas as determined by the commission a the commission may issue a generic or ongoing permit for maintaining repairing or replacing an existing and lawfully located structure or facility used in the service of the public to provide electric gas steam water telephone telegraph or other telecommunication services storm drainage and sewer provided that the structure or facility is not substantially changed or enlarged as determined by the commission and provided that written application has been given to the commission prior to commencement of work and provided that the work conforms to performance standards and design specifications in regulations adopted by the commission these standards and specifications shall conform to the best management practices in the commonwealth of massachusetts this ongoing permit may apply to other institutions in town with

prevent a net loss of wetlands and their values applicants proposing alteration of 100 square feet or more of any area subject to the jurisdiction of the bylaw may be required to replace not only the function of the area to be disturbed but also its physical properties characteristics and vegetative cover inability to do so may be cause for denial areas subject to the jurisdiction of the bylaw are presumed to be significant to the values protected by the bylaw until it is demonstrated otherwise by a preponderance of credible evidence to the contrary a the introduction purpose and performance standards stated in the wpa regulations 310 cmr 1051 shall apply except as stated below b rationale for no net loss policy natural wetlands perform many functions and it is not possible to replicate all of them furthermore it is difficult even to determine which functions are most probably or exclusively being performed in a given wetland area therefore destruction or alteration of wetlands should only be undertaken most cautiously and only as a last resort applicants are advised that the commission will require wetland replication based on the latest available scientific information and practices and will require replication on at least a  basis in order to increase the likelihood of success of the replication effort design of replacement wetlands should be based upon a quantitative showing of the functions operating in the natural wetland a sequence to prevent wetland loss the applicant shall submit an analysis of alternatives with the following sequencing approach used to evaluate any proposed wetland loss avoidance a permit will be issued only for the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative it is the obligation of the proponent to present this alternative for any nonwaterdependent activity compensatory mitigation or wetland replication will not qualify as avoidance 1 minimization once the test of avoidance has been met a proposal should minimize its adverse impacts modifications 2 b  30522 general provisions  30523   30524 limited projects the commission at its sole and reasonable discretion may issue a permit for the limited

discretion to permit with conditions as needed to ensure that the interests of the bylaw are protected  30525 freshwater wetlands it is the burden of the applicant to take all appropriate and practicable steps to minimize the impacts mitigation after the avoidance and minimization tests have been met all lost wetlands and resource areas shall be restored or replicated to previous natural vegetated conditions or better on at least a  basis with the focus being on replacement or restoration of function and acreage all mitigation shall be performed in south hadley 3 definition  critical characteristics freshwater wetlands shall include both bordering and isolated vegetated wetlands isolated vegetated wetlands are areas that meet the definition and critical characteristics of

hydric soils andor hydrologic conditions 1 isolated vegetated wetlands protected under the bylaw must be at least 500 square feet in area in addition to the minimum size requirement isolated vegetated wetlands must also meet at least two of the following three criteria the vegetation community consists of at least 50% or more wetland indicator plants as listed in the us fish and wildlife services national wetlands inventory plant list for massachusetts wetland indicator plants are classified by the us fish and wildlife service into the following categories facultative facultative wetland or obligate wetland based on the estimated percentage of the time they occur in wetlands under natural conditions a presence of indicators of hydrology such as but not limited to site inundation or

sedimentation control storm damage prevention prevention of water pollution protection of fisheries and wildlife habitat and rare species habitat including rare plant species and recreation and agriculture values 3 freshwater wetlands are south hadleys most important habitat for wildlife the hydrologic regime plant community composition and structure soil composition and structure topography and water chemistry of freshwater wetlands provide important food shelter migratory and overwintering areas and breeding areas for many birds mammals amphibians and reptiles a wide variety of vegetative wetland plants the nature of which are determined in large part by the depth and duration of water as well as soil and water composition are utilized by varied species as important areas for mating nesting brood rearing shelter and directly and indirectly food the diversity and interspersion of the vegetative structure is also important in determining its nature and use for wildlife habitat 4 presumption of significance where a proposed activity involves the removing filling dredging or altering of a freshwater wetland the commission shall presume that such an area is significant to the values described in the bylaw and of this section this presumption may be overcome upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence demonstrating that the freshwater wetland does not play a role in the protection of said interests in the event that the commission determines that the presumption has been overcome it shall make a written determination to that effect setting forth its grounds this determination may be overcome at a later date by a change in the site and reconsideration of its functions b performance standards for freshwater wetlands any proposed work in a freshwater wetland shall not destroy or otherwise impair any portion of said wetland the cutting of vegetation within a freshwater wetland in order to maintain a specific successional stage such as a wet meadow or for removal of invasive plants may be permitted at the commissions sole discretion filing of a notice of intent and subsequent order of conditions as part of a management plan approved by the commission in addition and at its sole discretion the commission may issue an order of conditions allowing work that results in the loss of up to 5000 square feet of freshwater wetland when said area is replaced in accordance with the following conditions and any additional specific conditions the commission deems 1 c  30525 general provisions  30525   30526 vernal pools necessary to ensure that the replacement area will function in a manner similar to the area that will be lost in situations where wetlands loss is unavoidable a compensatory wetland area shall be provided that is at least twice the size of the lost area  is at or below the same elevation  has the same hydrology and surface water elevation  has the same hydrologic connection to a water body  and is vegetated within two growing seasons with a plant community of at least 75% cover consisting of the same native plant community type and similar species composition to the lost area  and demonstrates a hydrologic regime similar to the lost area within two growing seasons the commission may require detailed plans professional oversight of construction monitoring for two years completion of the replication before the project begins and other conditions as needed to maximize the chance of a successful replication 2 isolated vegetated wetlands have a fiftyfoot nodisturbance conservation zone the same as bordering vegetated wetlands unless they qualify only as vernal pools in which case they follow the setback distances described in  30526 the onehundredfoot buffer zone of an isolated vegetated wetland shall have the same performance standards as described below for buffer zones of other wetlands 3 definition  critical characteristics vernal pools and their associated onehundredfoot buffer zones are likely to be significant to the protection of wildlife habitat and rare animal habitat vernal pools constitute a unique and increasingly rare type of wetland that is used by many species of wildlife some of which are totally dependent on vernal pools and the surrounding upland area for their survival the area within 100 feet of a vernal pool is considered vernal pool habitat these areas provide the obligate vernal pool species with important nonbreeding habitat functions such as migratory pathways feeding shelter and overwintering areas many other species utilize vernal pools and vernal pool habitat for breeding and nonbreeding functions as well although they are not restricted to this type of wetland the protection of vernal pools and vernal pool habitat is essential for the survival of wildlife species that depend on these unique and threatened resource areas vernal pools do not need to be certified by the nhesp to be protected under the bylaw and regulations but must be certifiable according to the criteria described in these regulations the conservation zone for vernal pools under the bylaw is based on the size of the pool although size does not necessarily indicate value vernal pools less than 10000 square feet in size are protected with a twentyfivefoot conservation zone 1 a  30525 south hadley code  30526  and those 10000 square feet and greater in size have a fiftyfoot conservation zone vernal pools exhibit great variation in physical geographic hydrologic and vegetative conditions which makes it difficult to easily define them a vernal pool is a temporary freshwater body which in most years holds water for a minimum of two continuous months and is free of established reproducing fish populations the boundary of a vernal pool is the perimeter of the largest observed or recorded volume of water confined in said area in the event of conflict of opinion regarding the extent of water confined in the basin the commission shall follow the procedures described for vernal pools in the wpa regulations 310 cmr 10572a6 and 10572b3 a vernal pool is protected under the bylaw if it is shown on the south hadley vernal pool map in appendix d54 and meets one of the following criteria a the vernal pool has been certified by the nhesp the vernal pool contains evidence of breeding of any one or more of the following obligate indicator species spotted salamander bluespotted salamander jefferson salamander marbled salamander wood frog or the presence of fairy shrimp and evidence that the pool meets the physical criteria described in the nhesp guidelines for the certification of vernal pool habitat b in the absence of obligate indicator species the vernal pool contains evidence of breeding by at least two of the following facultative indicator species spring peeper american toad gray treefrog or fowlers toad and meets the physical criteria described in the nhesp guidelines for the certification of vernal pool habitat c 2 timing of evidence collection and type of evidence many of the indicators of vernal pools are seasonal for example most salamander egg masses are only found between march and may except marbled salamanders which breed in the fall wood frog chorusing usually occurs between late march and late may and often at night not all animals breed every year depending on site and seasonal conditions so evidence may be sparse or lacking in some years consequently failure to find evidence of breeding must be tied explicitly to those periods during which the evidence is most likely to be available 1 accordingly in the case of challenges to the presumption of a vernal pool designation the commission may require that the determination be postponed until the appropriate time period consistent with the evidence being presented the commission 2 b 54editors note appendix d is included as an attachment to this chapter  30526 general provisions  30526  may require its own site visits or those of a professional as necessary to confirm the evidence or lack thereof type of evidence accepted to verify an area as a vernal pool will be the same as described by the nhesp for its certification program in addition the commission may accept as evidence a statement signed under penalties of perjury attesting to the presence of vernal pool obligate indicator species in a pool from a competent source 3 presumption of significance where a proposed activity involves the removing filling dredging or altering of a vernal pool or its onehundred foot buffer zone the commission shall presume that the vernal pool and its onehundredfoot buffer zone are significant to the protection of wildlife habitat and rare species this presumption is rebuttable by a showing of clear and convincing evidence that the vernal pool or its buffer zone does not play a role in the protection of said interests when such evidence is based on the absence of any obligate or facultative indicator species the commission may require documentation of such absence of evidence from the spring time of two different years in the event that the presumption is deemed by the commission to have been overcome the commission shall make a written determination to this effect setting forth its grounds the determination that the basin is not a vernal pool is not permanent and may be overcome at a later date by the criteria listed in above c performance standards for vernal pools when the presumption set forth in of this section is not overcome the following standards shall apply to vernal pools their onehundredfoot buffer zone and their twentyfivefoot or fiftyfoot conservation zones no alteration of vernal pools will be permitted that will have an adverse effect upon wildlife habitat adverse effect means the alteration of any habitat characteristic listed below insofar as such alteration will following two growing seasons of project completion and thereafter substantially reduce its capacity to provide the important wildlife habitat functions listed in the wpa regulations 310 cmr 10602 these characteristics include the topography soil structure plant community composition and structure and hydrologic regime the procedure to evaluate whether a proposed project will have an adverse effect is described in the wpa regulations 310 cmr 10601 and 2 restoration and replication of altered vernal pool habitat shall be performed as described in the wpa regulations 310 cmr 10603 except the commission requires  or greater replication and may require other additional conditions as deemed necessary to guarantee success of replication and mitigation for the alteration 1 the conservation zone is a nodisturbance zone no activity shall be permitted within 25 feet or 50 feet depending on the size of the 2 d  30526 south

described below for the buffer zone 3 migratory pathways of vernal pool breeders work shall not be allowed that obstructs the migratory pathways of vernal pool breeding species 4 definition  critical characteristics for the purpose of these regulations an intermittent stream is that segment of a flowing watercourse that experiences naturally occurring sporadic flow interruptions such that it does not have a continuous sheet of surface water for four or more consecutive days in any consecutive twelvemonth period during nondrought conditions in areas not significantly impacted by beaver or other impoundments 1 the streams and rivers map in appendix e55 shows the maximum possibility of intermittent streams under the protection of the south hadley wetland protection bylaw but it does not determine which are intermittent and which are perennial that determination is made based on this definition and the criteria below under these regulations all flowing watercourses shall be considered perennial streams if they are shown as perennial streams on the most current usgs topographic map qualify under the dep perennial stream criteria in the wpa regulations 310 cmr 10582 or are shown as a

of a collection of books and other materials specifically selected to satisfy the informational recreational educational and cultural needs of library users  4274 service priorities the provision of popular materials and services is considered the top priority of the library patrons constantly seek materials in a variety of formats including books magazines newspapers audiovisual electronic and other media formats with the availability of libraries in the public schools and mount holyoke college the public librarys obligation to support formal learning and curricula is reduced in addition to materials and regular library services programs such as childrens storytime sessions and special events the summer reading program adult discussion groups and other programs sponsored by the library strive to meet the needs and interests of the librarys users a it is the librarys goal to furnish a comfortable and safe facility with adequate space to house both materials and services the library also strives to provide an adequate number of trained staff to assist patrons in using the library to their full potential and to contribute to the development of library collections and services the library accomplishes these goals 1 purchasing appropriate materials with available funds participating in the centralwestern massachusetts automated resource sharing system cwmars network centrally serving multitype libraries in western and central massachusetts 2 supplementing the collection by borrowing materials for patrons loan coordinated by the western massachusetts regional library system wmrls 3 using the regional reference service provided by wmrls to answer questions that are beyond the librarys capacities 4 5 participating in resource sharing efforts with area libraries offering

selection policy the board delegates the charge of administering the policy to the library director the director in turn may delegate the duty for selection weeding and maintenance to specific staff members based on their areas of responsibility expertise and interest however the decisions these staff members make concerning the collection will be subject to review by the library director who must answer to the trustees for collection development  4277 intellectual freedom acknowledging the librarys priorities described above it is the goal of the library to provide a collection that meets the demand for current and popular materials while providing a balance of older still relevant items through collection development that includes both acquiring and discarding materials the library strives to maintain a collection of materials that is current authoritative well used in good physical condition and available in a variety of media formats the library does not collect textbooks scholarly books and periodicals or other resources that are deemed more appropriate for the school academic or special library because the library participates in resource sharing regionally statewide and nationally such as wmrls and cwmars it does not attempt to purchase all items requested by patrons infrequently requested and specialized items that are beyond the scope of the collection are instead borrowed loan or patrons are referred to other libraries that own the material a the adult collection includes books magazines movies music electronic resources and other appropriate materials the collection serves older teens adults and senior citizens books include fiction and nonfiction in hardcover paperback and largeprint formats the library maintains a collection of popular magazines and newspapers and retains limited back issues for most titles the audiovisual collection includes movies music and other popular media formats b the youth collection includes books magazines movies

rights of the united states constitution specifically in regard to the right to publish and read diverse opinions as a public institution the library is committed to the principles of intellectual freedom and is cognizant of its obligation to provide as wide a spectrum of materials as possible furthermore the library endorses the freedom to read freedom to view and the library bill of rights and their interpretations issued by the american library association included in these statements is the commitment to honor the rights of the individual to use the library regardless of age race religion national origin or social and political views a librarians are responsible to direct patrons toward appropriate materials but will not restrict the use of the collection based upon the age of the user the library takes the position that the risk of not providing access to information and ideas is greater than the risk of providing it therefore the library staff will not act as in loco parentis b responsibility for the materials children borrow or library computers used rests entirely at the discretion of parents and guardians c the library reserves the right to control the use of rare andor fragile items in the collection such as local history materials to the extent required to preserve them from harm d the library director and delegated staff are responsible for the selection of library materials staff members make recommendations based on their experience and knowledge of library services their familiarity with the communitys needs and their knowledge of the existing collection a materials are judged on the basis of the work as a whole not on a part taken out of context by using the following criteria for acquisitions gifts and withdrawals the library strives to strengthen its collection fair and balanced selection process 1 popular interest and demand 2 critical reviews  professional journals  publishers catalogs 3 reputation popularity or significance of author accurate coverage of contemporary or historical topics issues and personalities 4 5 currency of information relation to existing collection  the balance of opinions including minority views 6 7 artistic expression originality imagination and presentation b  4277 general provisions  4278   4279 gifts all donated materials are reviewed as part of the selection process using

durability and condition 12technical merit and ease of use availability resources including interlibrary loan and the internet 13 in order to maintain a collection that is current in good condition well used relevant to community interests and reliable materials are withdrawn on a systematic and continuing basis a materials are discarded when they are judged to be dated or obsolete inaccurate seldom used in poor condition or otherwise no longer appropriate for the collection the availability of shelf space is also unfortunately a major consideration titles withdrawn due to loss damage or theft are not automatically replaced the criteria used in selection also apply to the process of weeding materials withdrawn from the library will be disposed of in a manner consistent with their quality and condition some materials may be sold for the benefit of the library materials judged to be too dated inaccurate or unattractive will be discarded b back issues of periodicals are kept for a specified period of time and then recycled the period of storage time for each periodical is determined by the continued need for the title to be available in the library space limitations may preclude some periodicals from being kept for extended periods of time c community involvement is a key principle in the development of the librarys collection patron suggestions for new acquisitions are always welcome as popular demand is an integral part of the selection criteria many materials not owned by the library can be obtained on loan from other institutions suggestions for the purchase of new a  4278 south hadley code  42711  materials should be in writing or a computer printout and include as much publishing information as possible the suggestion should also include the patrons name and contact information the selection criteria listed above will be applied to the request patrons may also voice their concerns over the inclusion of specific materials within the collection the board of library trustees believes that censorship is a purely individual matter and declares that while anyone is free to reject material of which one does not approve one cannot exercise this right to restrict the freedom of others the trustees and library director will remove no materials from the library except under a formal reconsideration request any library patron in good standing may request the reconsideration of materials owned by the library the steps for a formal request are as follows the customer will fill out and sign a request for reconsideration appended or submit an equivalent written and signed statement 1 the document will be forwarded to the library director who will attach hisher comments and forward this information to the library trustees for discussion at their next regularly scheduled meeting 2 the trustees and library director will discuss the issue in depth regarding use of the material within the library and make a formal recommendation 3 the
