employed by the planning board where the applicant demonstrates substantial compliance with the standards set forth in this ordinance as well as the bow master plan and  purpose 1502 intent a zoning was first implemented as a technique for separating incompatible types of land development thereby protecting lowintensity uses from the harmful or disagreeable impacts of highintensity uses however conventional zoning may produce its own set of undesirable side effects b as design and technology continually change in the marketplace new types of land uses are proposed which cannot be easily assigned to existing zoning classifications unfortunately desirable land developments may be denied appealed to the zoning board of adjustment where demonstrating a hardship may be required or subjected to lengthy rezoning procedures requiring a townwide ballot vote c performance standards measure the quantifiable impacts of each proposed development rather than prohibiting certain classes of land use performance zoning offers an alternative method for implementing community goals as outlined in the bow master plan while offering property owners a means to optimize the use of their land 1503 purpose the purpose of the a business development district a to attract environmentally acceptable commercial industrial recreational and institutional uses to the district  b to encourage
