in ic 3674 and 14284 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the common council of the city of attica does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations a  findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city of attica are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages b  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands fmake federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program c  objectives the objectives of this chapter are ato protect human life and health bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public dto minimize prolonged business interruptions eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas gto ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area d definitions  definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application a zone means portions of the sfha in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall

mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply 5zone ar areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply 6zone a99 areas subject to inundation by the one percent annual chance flood event but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an underconstruction federal flood protection system these are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system such as dikes dams and levees to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes zone a99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion no base flood elevations or depths are shown mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply accessory structure appurtenant structure means a structure that is
