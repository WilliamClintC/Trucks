land for the benefit of the city the school district the county and other taxing districts and to encourage the comprehensive design and integrated development of large tracts of land suitable for a variety of mutually supported commercial industrial and retail uses the general purposes of this planned unit district pud are served by the following basic principles a comprehensive planning of large tracts of land promotes the creation of jobs providing opportunities for the integration of various development projects and clearly identifiable growth centers in a region b comprehensive planning and different types of uses can be successfully integrated and provide functional convenience and efficiency in the provision of public services and infrastructure c comprehensive planning and integrated design with higher densities of development than are otherwise permitted in this be accommodated in a pud without loss of environmental or other quality the general benefits of higher density include greater productivity of land more efficient utilization of transportation and utilities more convenient access between different developments the potential for higher development returns that can be channeled towards provision of higher level pedestrian and open space amenities and a concentration within a limited area of the critical mass of people necessary to support varied uses d comprehensive planning and integrated design of large tract of land allow for better detailed definition and administration of architectural and landscape design controls the advantages of

exist from any authoritative source the flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations or base flood elevations determined andor approved by the floodplain administrator qfloodway 1a floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood discharge a floodway is typically determined hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated height in no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any point within the community 2the floodway is an extremely hazardous area and is usually characterized by any of the following moderate to high velocity flood waters high potential for debris and projectile impacts and moderate to high erosion forces rfreeboard a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management freeboard tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions such as wave

rate maps flood boundary and floodway maps and flood insurance studies lomcs are broken down into the following categories 1letter of map amendment loma a revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area a loma amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard area 2letter of map revision lomr a revision based on technical data that usually due to manmade changes shows changes to flood zones flood elevations floodplain and floodway
