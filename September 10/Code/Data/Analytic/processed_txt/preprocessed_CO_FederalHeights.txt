derived from the  81218124 and adopted  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the public b flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  8202013 statement of purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to critical facilities infrastructure and other public facilities such as water sewer and gas mains  electric and communications stations  and streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is located in a flood hazard area  8202013 methods of reducing flood losses the following methods may be used to reduce flood losses 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or

the underground relocation undergrounding of overhead lines wires and cables used for the distribution of electricity or the transmission of telecommunication services along with the removal of utility poles from cityowned property serves a wide variety of important public purposes b undergrounding enhances public safety by removing obstructions in the public rightofway mitigating the risk of vehicular collisions with utility poles  improving the sight lines for vehicular and pedestrian traffic along roadways  and mitigating the risk of hazards associated with negligent or inadvertent contact with overhead lines c undergrounding enhances the appearance and aesthetics of the city by removing unsightly lines and poles from public view  improving scenic vistas in and around city parks and natural areas and within the citys residential and commercial neighborhoods generally  and allowing the citys tree canopy to flourish without conflict with overhead utility lines d undergrounding enhances the safety and security of the electric and telecommunications lines by protecting the lines from damage due to inclement weather or accidents and thus preserves the continuity and reliability of electric and telecommunications services to the public at large e coordinated undergrounding projects in which all affected electric and telecommunication lines are relocated underground at the same time offer the most efficient way to achieve the benefits of undergrounding at the lowest possible cost for the owners of the lines and their customers f since  the city has included within its electric utility franchise certain undergrounding requirements for electric distribution facilities including the establishment of a fund for electric utility undergrounding projects as directed by the public works director g since  the city has included within its cable television franchises undergrounding requirements for cable television lines requiring the franchisee to relocate its overhead lines underground when other overhead utility lines are being relocated underground h because other telecommunications companies that maintain overhead lines including the citys local exchange telephone service provider have not heretofore been required by any city law or franchise to cooperate and participate in underground relocation projects on occasion telephone and other telecommunications lines have remained overhead and suspended from utility poles in locations where all other electric distribution and cable television lines have been relocated underground i the continued existence of overhead telecommunications lines and utility poles in a location where all other utilities have been relocated underground compromises public safety and the general welfare of the public j as a home rule city federal heights exercises broad inherent authority to regulate the use of city streets alleys parks parkways and other cityowned property under its police power k in addition to its home rule authority the colorado constitution and various state statutes recognize the authority of municipalities to regulate the placement of public utility structures and facilities on public property in general and utility poles and service lines in particular l the colorado supreme court has repeatedly recognized the authority of municipalities to require the relocation of public utilities at the utilitys expense in conjunction with municipal efforts to improve public property m pursuant to state statute crs  403115 providers of local exchange telephone

forth in this section are intended to provide general guidance in the development and review of site plans and building elevations recognizing that some flexibility is allowed given site specific conditions and the unique circumstances of the application the decision of approval shall be based upon whether the proposal complies with the development standards established herein and elsewhere in this any other adopted policies and whether the proposal substantially complies with the guidelines established in this section substantial compliance with the guidelines does not require compliance with each of the guidelines or substantial compliance with each individual guideline but rather a demonstrated attempt to comply with the guidelines with the result of compliance with the preponderance of the guidelines in their entirety those site development criteria that are reasonable for the intended use shall be required 1 vicinity considerations  a standards 1 access to public transit facilities shall be provided for by incorporating bus loading zones where necessary 2 the anticipated traffic impact shall be acceptable for adjacent road conditions or the proposal will include improvements to mitigate any traffic impacts b guidelines 1 the project should present logical onsiteoffsite pedestrian auto and bike connections 2 the overall project in terms of site layout screening and design should demonstrate a compatible relationship to adjacent uses 3 screening should be provided to mitigate unattractive views such as the rear elevation of buildings loading areas outdoor storage areas outside trash receptacles building or roofmounted mechanical equipment and sources of glare noise or other potential negative effects of development screening should be provided in a manner that screens unsightly views from public rightsofway pedestrian paths and adjacent properties screening may be achieved variety of means including setbacks planting fences walls site design architectural design and other such measures 2 site layout guidelines a the design and arrangement of elements of the site plan should exhibit a favorable relationship with the existing natural topography and natural water bodies and efforts should be made to incorporate existing desirable vegetation b the elements of the site plan should be designed to maximize the opportunity of privacy for adjacent land uses in particular residential land c the site layout should consider microclimate conditions and its impact on the safety and convenience of the public in particular entryways and pedestrian paths should be located in such a manner as to minimize snow and ice accumulation 3 building scale and design a standards 1 multiple buildings in single projects shall be varied in size and mass if there is change in building height throughout the site a transition from low buildings at the site perimeter to larger and taller structures on the interior of the site is required 2 buildings shall be separated from pavement areas with landscaping andor walkways 3 facades shall be articulated to reduce the massive scale and uniform appearance by incorporating horizontal relief projections and recesses at minimum horizontal intervals of 40 feet to provide visual interest changes in height and relief from long flat walls arcades display windows entry areas awnings or other such features and changes in color texture and material should be used to accomplish such purpose b guidelines 1 the building height mass scale orientation and configuration should be compatible with adjacent land uses and provide for harmonious and appropriate transitions where there are differences in character between different land uses 2 a single building complex should be stylistically compatible significant patterns or unifying elements such as architectural style materials colors and form should work together to express a single theme and to achieve design harmony and continuity pad buildings should match materials of main buildings structures within the overall development should be similar and have consistent design elements such as roof forms use of building awnings facade articulation and repetitive entry design elements 3 all facades of a building that are visible from adjoining properties andor public streets or paths should be treated with the similar degree of architectural style and detail of the front elevation 4 roof forms building height and parapet walls should vary to provide visual interest at building tops rooftops should contribute to the visual continuity of each development and should be considered as design elements seen from various viewpoints rooflines running in continuous planes should be avoided by offsetting or jogging the roof planes to add visual interest or reducing the scale to break up long continuous rooflines roof forms should be designed to correspond to and denote building elements and functions such as entrances arcades porches etc 5 the human scale of the site should be promoted use of canopies overhangs awnings windows decorative detailing lighting planters seating areas street furniture and accessories signage water features landscaping patterned walkways public art bicycle parking building materials and other elements which will enhance the human scale emphasis of the site 6 entryways to buildings should be emphasized utilizing architectural elements so that they are visible from the street this can be achieved in a number of ways including canopies or porticos overhangs recessesprojections arcades raised cornice parapets over the doors peaked roof forms arches outdoor patios display windows architectural details 7 exterior materials should be sufficiently durable to ensure stability maintainability and longevity 8 colors should be aesthetically pleasing to a reasonable person earth tone colors should be compatible with the project built and the natural environment should be used for the dominant color primary colors may be used for accent but should not constitute the dominant color of any structure reflective materials such as bright aluminum and glass as the primary building material that will generate glare should be avoided 4 vehicular circulation  parking  access a standards 1 the circulationparkingaccess system shall provide for the safe orderly efficient

circulation within the development shall be designed to provide safe and efficient turning movements for all anticipated service and emergency vehicles b guidelines 1 the internal circulation of projects involving multiple buildings should function as a whole and should include all necessary cross access easements where applicable to the extent possible adjoining and proximate projects should provide shared access 2 the proposal should demonstrate that adequate provisions have been made to limit the effects of vehicular noise and exhaust and to minimize paving 3 parking areas should be designed so that the lots do not visually dominate the site and so that the visual impact on the adjacent properties and from the public rightofway is minimized this may be achieved by careful placement of buildings distribution of parking throughout the site use of landscaping and topography or other innovative site planning techniques 4 where possible the use of low opaque walls andor bermed landscaping should be utilized to screen parking from peripheral streets 5 open spacelandscape considerations  guidelines a the project should provide for optimum preservation of natural site features including without limitation mature trees terrain groundwater and surface water wetlands riparian areas and drainage areas and incorporate these areas into the open space plan b the open space should be useable and functional and should be coordinated with adjacent open space where practical c the landscaping should provide for aesthetic enhancement and should utilize a variety of

scale and style appropriate to the development signage should be architecturally compatible in color and design with the associated structures and should not detract from the architectural character or aesthetic appeal of the community 4 the size of signs should afford businesses sufficient visibility and identification without becoming a dominant part of the landscape 5 the fencing should be designed to complement the structures on site as demonstrated by material design and color 7 public safety  guidelines a the site should have adequate access controls and secure barriers to prevent unauthorized access to the buildings grounds and restricted areas the site should have clear territory identity that differentiates private areas from public spaces and discourages trespassing b the site layout should be designed to provide natural surveillance that increases the probability of detection for offenders this would include clear lines of sight to building entrances and parking areas from the street and from inside the building c there should be provisions for adequate surveillance devices that protect the business and the public d the landscaping should be designed to exclude visual barriers that provide havens for law offenders e all vehicular use areas pedestrian circulation paths and exterior portions of buildings should be provided with adequate security lighting f the site should be designed to avoid the creation of blind areas that cannot be patrolled by police or security staff g site drainage should be designed to minimize water collection near building foundations entrances pedestrian ramps and service ramps as well as inadvertent ponding within vehicular parking areas 8 resource protection  environmental considerations  guidelines a the project should result in minimal cut and fill on the site the design of the buildings should conform as much as possible to the natural contours of the land and the site design should minimize erosion slope instability landslide mudflow or subsidence to the subject and adjacent properties b environmentally sensitive areas and significant existing vegetation should be preserved and protected no structures
