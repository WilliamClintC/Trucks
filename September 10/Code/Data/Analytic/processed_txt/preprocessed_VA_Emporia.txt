declared to be a part of this article and which shall be kept on file at the city offices 1 the floodway district is delineated for purposes of this article using the criterion that certain areas within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the onepercent annual chance flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point the
