authorization the legislature of the state has in the flood control insurance act texas water section  delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the town does ordain as follows of fact a the flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage of purpose it is the purpose of this division to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions     92665 5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this division uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  6 limit or prohibit development which does not comply with the towns comprehensive plan land use plan andor thoroughfare plan  and 7 require detailed floodplain evaluation of proposed development or floodplain alteration prior to permitting unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this division shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this division its most reasonable application alluvial fan flooding flooding occurring on the surface of an

conservation plan objectives a water supply has always been a key issue in the development of the state in recent years the growing population and economic development of north central texas have led to increasing demands for water supplies at the same time local and less expensive sources of water supply are largely developed additional supplies to meet higher demands will be expensive and difficult to develop it is therefore important that ntmwd and its member cities and customers make the most efficient use of existing supplies this will delay the need for new supplies minimize the environmental impacts associated with developing new supplies and delay the high cost of additional water supply development b recognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies the texas commission on environmental quality tceq has developed guidelines and requirements governing the development of water conservation and drought contingency plans for public water suppliers the best management practices established by the water conservation implementation task force established pursuant to sb1094 by the 78th legislature were also considered in the development of the water conservation measures the north texas municipal water district ntmwd also developed a model water conservation plan for its member cities and customers following tceq guidelines and requirements the towns water conservation plan was developed in concert with that model and with the ntmwds own water conservation plan c this plan includes measures that are intended to result in ongoing longterm water savings the drought contingency and water emergency response plan addresses strategies designed to temporarily reduce water use in response to specific conditions the objectives of this model water conservation plan are as follows 1 to reduce water consumption from the levels that would prevail without conservation efforts  2 to reduce the loss and waste of water     445665 3 to improve efficiency in the use of water  4 to document the level of recycling and reuse in the water supply  5 to extend the life of current water supplies by reducing the rate of growth in demand  and 6 to preserve supplies for essential uses under drought or water emergency conditions commission on environmental quality rules conservation plans the tceq rules governing development of water conservation plans for public water suppliers are contained in title 30 part 1 chapter 288 subchapter a rule 2882 of the texas administrative the purpose of these rules a water conservation plan is defined as a strategy or combination of strategies for reducing the volume of water withdrawn from a water supply source for reducing the loss or waste of water for maintaining or improving the efficiency in the use of water for increasing the recycling and reuse of water and for preventing the pollution of water the elements in the tceq water conservation rules covered in this conservation plan are listed

appendix b to this water conservation plan attached to b is based on the format recommended by the tceq for a water utility profile in adopting this plan the town will provide a draft utility profile to ntmwd for review and comment a final water utility profile will be provided to ntmwd upon adoption of and any updates to this plan of water conservation goals tceq rules require the adoption of specific water conservation goals for a water conservation plan the goals for this water conservation plan include the following 1 maintain the per capita municipal water use below the specified amount in gallons per capita per day in a dry year as shown in the completed table 41 2 maintain the level of unaccounted water in the system below twelve percent annually in 2013 and subsequent years 3 implement and maintain a program of universal metering and meter replacement and repair 4 increase efficient water usage water conservation ordinance order or resolution this ordinance is required by the ntmwd 5 decrease waste in lawn irrigation by implementation and enforcement of landscape water management regulations 6 raise public awareness of water conservation and encourage responsible public behavior by a public education and information program    447665 7 develop a system specific strategy to conserve water during peak demands thereby reducing the peak use table 41 fiveyear and tenyear municipal per capita water use goals gpcd description current average gpcd 5year goal gcpd 10year goal gpcd current 5year average per capita municipal use with credit for reuse 268 262 255 expected reduction due to lowflow plumbing fixtures projected reduction due to elements in this plan water conservation goals with credit for reuse water use records control of unaccounted water and leak detection and repair one of the key elements of water conservation is tracking water use and controlling losses caused by illegal diversions and leaks it is important to carefully meter water use detect and repair leaks in the distribution system and provide regular monitoring of unaccounted water 1 accurate metering of treated water deliveries from ntmwd water deliveries from ntmwd are metered by ntmwd using meters with accuracy of 2% these meters are calibrated on a monthly basis by ntmwd to maintain the required accuracy 2 metering of customer and public uses and meter testing repair and replacement a the provision of water to all customers including public and governmental users should be metered the town already meters all residential retail wholesale water users all internal water uses parks town facilities special uses firefighting and training where practical etc b prior to 2008 the town replaced a large percentage of its meters going forward all customer meters should be replaced at least every fifteen years and the town shall maintain all records necessary to ensure said replacements are completed in a timely manner 3 record management system as required by tac title 30 part 1 chapter 288 subchapter a rule 2882a2b the towns record management system allows for the separation of water sales    448665 and uses into residential commercial publicinstitutional and industrial categories this information shall be included in an annual water conservation report 4 determination and control of unaccounted water a unaccounted water is the difference between water delivered to the town from ntmwd and other supplies if applicable and metered water sales to customers plus authorized but unmetered uses authorized but unmetered uses include use for firefighting releases for flushing of lines uses associated with new construction etc unaccounted water can include several categories i inaccuracies in customer meters ii accounts that are being used but have not yet been added to the billing system iii losses due to water main breaks and leaks in the water distribution system iv losses due to illegal connections and theft v other b measures to control unaccounted water shall be a part of the routine operations of the towns utility department maintenance crews and personnel shall look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system meter readers shall watch for and report signs of illegal connections so they can be quickly addressed c unaccounted water should be calculated in accordance with the provisions of appendix b to b with the measures described in this plan the town hopes to maintain unaccounted water below twelve percent if unaccounted water exceeds this goal the town shall consider implementing a more intensive audit to determine the sources of and reduce the unaccounted water the annual conservation report is the primary tool that shall be used to monitor unaccounted water 5 leak detection and repair as described above town crews and personnel shall look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system areas of the water distribution system in which numerous leaks and line breaks occur shall be targeted for replacement as funds are available 6 monitoring of effectiveness and efficiency  annual water conservation report appendix c to b shall be used in the development of an annual water conservation report by the town this form shall be completed by march 31st of each year and used to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of the water conservation program and to plan conservationrelated activities for the next year the form records the water use by category per capita municipal use and unaccounted water for the current year and compares them to historical values the annual water conservation report shall be sent to ntmwd which will monitor water conservation trends 7 water conservation implementation report appendix a to b includes the tceqrequired water conservation implementation report the report is due to the tceq by may 1st of each year this report lists the various water conservation strategies that have been implemented including the date the strategy was implemented the report also updates the status of the fiveyear and tenyear per capita water use goals from the previous water conservation plan public education and information campaign the towns continuing public education and information campaign on water conservation includes the following elements    449665 1 utilize the water iq know your water and other

from ntmwd and does not have surface water supplies for which to implement a system operation plan ntmwds permits do allow some coordinated operation of its water supply sources and ntmwd is seeking additional water rights for coordinated operation to optimize its available water supplies b reuse and recycling of wastewater the town neither owns nor operates a wastewater treatment plant wastewater is treated by ntmwd which has the largest wastewater reuse program in the state ntmwd has water rights allowing reuse of up to 71882 acrefeet per year of this treated wastewater lavon for municipal purposes in addition ntmwd has also developed the east fork raw water supply project which can divert up to 157393 acrefeet per year based on treated wastewater discharges by the ntmwd when fully developed these two reuse projects will provide up to 44 percent of the ntmwds currently permitted water supplies ntmwd also provides treated effluent from its wastewater treatment plants available for direct reuse for landscape irrigation and industrial use c ordinances plumbing codes or rules on waterconserving fixtures the state has required waterconserving fixtures in new construction and renovations since 1992 the state standards call for flows of no more than 25 gallons per minute gpm for faucets 30 gpm for showerheads and 16 gallons per flush for toilets similar standards are now required nationally under federal law these state and federal standards assure that all new construction and renovations will use waterconserving fixtures d landscape water

objectives a the purpose of this drought contingency and water emergency plan is as follows 1 to conserve the available water supply in times of drought and emergency 2 to maintain supplies for domestic water use sanitation and fire protection 3 to protect and preserve public health welfare and safety 4 to minimize the adverse impacts of water supply shortages 5 to minimize the adverse impacts of emergency water supply conditions b a drought is defined as an extended period of time when an area receives insufficient amounts of rainfall to replenish the water supply causing water supply sources in this case reservoirs to be depleted in the absence of drought response measures water demands tend to increase during a drought due to the need for additional    452665 outdoor irrigation the severity of a drought depends on the depletion of supplies and on the relationship of demand to available supplies the ntmwd considers a drought to end when all of its supply reservoirs refill to the conservation storage pool commission on environmental quality rules the tceq rules governing development of drought contingency plans for public water towns are contained in title 30 part 1 chapter 288 subchapter b rule 28820 of the texas administrative the purpose of these rules a drought contingency plan is defined as a strategy or combination of strategies for temporary supply
