whereabouts of children is the accepted norm by a substantial majority of the community legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many communities over the

council finds it necessary for the health safety and welfare of the people sewed by the water division of the city utilities department to adopt crossconnection control standards which establish the requirements for the design construction and maintenance of connections to the public water supply these standards are supplemental but do not supersede or modify the state plumbing code and its latest revision under which the city operates cross reference state plumbing code adopted 72559 and revisions  1    purpose the purposes of this article are a to provide for the protection of the public potable water supply  b to isolate at the service connection any actual or potential pollution or contamination within the consumers premises  and c to provide a continuous systematic and effective program of crossconnection control  2    definitions backflow shall mean the flow of water or other liquids mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable supply of water from any source other than its intended source backflow preventer shall mean a device or means to prevent backflow double checkvalveassembly means an assembly composed of two single independently acting approved check valves including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connection for testing the watertightness of each check valve reducedpressureprinciple backflow prevention device means a complete assembly meeting applicable awwa standards and the requirements of the state plumbing code consisting of a hydraulically operating mechanically independent differential relief valve located between a minimum of two independently acting approved check valves these are located between two tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves with four properly placed resilientseated test cocks      operational criteria it is the primary responsibility of the water purveyor andor superintendent to evaluate the hazards inherent in supplying a consumers water system ie determine whether solid liquid or gaseous pollutants or contaminants are or may be handled on the consumers premises in such a manner as to possibly permit contamination of the public water system when a hazard or potential hazard to the public water system is found on the consumers premises the consumer shall be required to install an approved backflow prevention device at each public water service connection to the premises in accordance with this articles requirements the type of device shall depend on the degree of hazard involved  4    protective devices the type of protective device required shall depend on the degree of hazard as described in awwa manual m14 or as described below where more than one type of protection is possible the actual method utilized shall be at the discretion of the water purveyor andor superintendent after physical inspection of the hazard a in the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply there shall be no physical connection between said auxiliary water supply and the consumers water system which is served by the public water supply system where such connections are found disconnections shall be accomplished and the public water system shall be protected against the possibility of future connection by an approved reducedpressureprinciple backflow prevention device at the service connection b in the case of any premises where there is water or a substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the public water system the public water system shall be protect by an approved doublecheck valve assembly c in the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system the public water system shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device d in the case of any premises where because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions it is impossible or impractical to make a complete inplant crossconnection survey the public water system shall be protected by the installation of an approved reducedpressureprinciple backflow prevention device at the service connection  5    facilities requiring backflow protection a the following is a partial list of the facilities which may require reducedpressure principle backflow preventers at the service connection requirements are based upon the degree of hazard afforded the public potable water system 1 automatic car washes 2 auxiliary water systems 3 beauty parlors and barber shops 4 doctor and dental offices 5 exterminators 6 facilities with commercial boilers or chilled water system 7

accumulations of water surface or underground natural or artificial public or private which are contained within flow or border upon the state of any portion thereof     general provisions a introduction and findings the city council finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from developed land adversely affects the public health safety and welfare because 1 impervious surfaces increase the quantity and velocity of surface runoff which reduces percolation of water increases erosion and flooding  2 improper stormwater collection and conveyance adversely affects property and increases the incidence and severity of flooding which can endanger property and human life  3 increased erosion leads to sedimentation in stormwater management systems which decreases the systems capacity  and 4 many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff management practices b purpose 1 the purpose of this chapter is to set forth the minimum requirements for construction site erosion control and stormwater management associated with both future land development and existing developed land within the city these requirements will diminish threats to public health safety public and private property and natural resources of the city by establishing performance standards that will help to a protect life and property from dangers associated with flooding  b protect property from damage resulting from runoff or erosion  c ensure the annual runoff rates and volumes from post development site conditions mimic the annual runoff rates and volumes from predevelopment site conditions  d promote regional stormwater management by watershed  e provide a single consistent set of performance standards that apply to all developments  f protect water quality from nutrients pathogens toxic matters debris and other contaminants  g protect water quality from nutrients pathogens toxic matters debris and other contaminants  h promote infiltration and groundwater recharge  i provide a vegetated corridor buffer to protect water resources from development  j protect functional values of natural water courses and wetlands  k provide plant and animal habitat and support riparian ecosystems  l minimize sedimentation to the water resources of the city  m protect functional values of natural water courses and wetlands  n protect property from damage resulting from runoff or erosion  o control soil erosion and sedimentation to minimize soil deposition in streams and other receiving water bodies and storm drainage systems  p require implementation of best management practices to minimize the discharge of chemicals and other illicit discharges and pollutants either directly or indirectly into the streams rivers lakes and other bodies of water and into the citys drainage infrastructure  and q assure the city is and will remain in compliance with federal and state law 2 the application of this chapter and the provisions
