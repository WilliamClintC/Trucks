specific limitation of time but are generally intended to restrict further investments in such uses that would make them more permanent or less desirable the regulations also restrict further investment in noncomplying structures and lots of record that would increase the degree of noncompliance this for compatible nonconforming uses that the improvement of a nonconforming use may be desirable in unique circumstances to achieve additional protection of adjacent property and benefit the surrounding neighborhood this recognizes for redevelopment exceptions that new standards for
