lots with low runoff coefficients 2 all uses on undeveloped lots of record as of  where the difference between the runoff of a tenyear frequency rainfall as applied to the entire lot including the proposed improvements is less than or equal to one cubic foot per second when compared to the amount of total stormwater runoff generated from a twoyear frequency rainfall on the lot as it existed in its natural undeveloped state however following initial development should any deed transfer lot split resubdivision or addition reduce the computed lot area or increase the amount of impervious surface increasing the runoff by an amount greater than one cubic foot per second then stormwater detention shall be provided for the entire lot in conformance to the criteria in subsection c of this

special detention requirements the city council upon recommendation of the planning and zoning commission or at its own discretion may prescribe that a higher degree of stormwater detention be required if it is in the best interest of the general public the special detention requirement will normally be reserved for developments with large quantities of impervious surfaces where the drainage basin in which the development is located is experiencing flooding problems or where receiving stormwater facilities cannot accept the normal twoyear storm discharge e waivers stormwater detention requirements may be waived by the city council following receipt of sufficient written justification from the property owner indicating that it is not physically or economically feasible to detain stormwater and that such discharge will not be injurious to downstream properties in the drainage basin f evaluation of drainage system all developments and subdivisions which are required by this section to provide stormwater detention or installation of a public storm sewer system shall provide an evaluation of the 100year storm overflow from the developments primary drainage system the

public establishment of floodplain districts a statutory authorization the legislature of the state has in iowa delegated the responsibility to cities to enact zoning regulations to secure safety from flood and to promote health and the general welfare b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the community 2 such losses hazards and related adverse effects are caused by a the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood  and b the cumulative effect of floodplain construction on flood flows which causes increases in flood heights and floodwater velocities 3 this article relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the department of natural resources c classes of districts in order to classify regulate and restrict the location of trades and industries and the location of buildings designed for specific uses to regulate and limit the height and bulk of buildings erected or altered to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of lot areas and to regulate and determine the area of yards courts and other open spaces within and surrounding such buildings within established floodprone areas the city is hereby divided into three classes of floodplain districts the use height and area regulations are uniform in each class of district and the districts shall be known as the fw floodway district the ff floodway fringe district and the fp general floodplain district d purpose of districts it is the purpose of the floodplain districts to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private damages due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health 2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects 3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4 minimize prolonged business interruptions 5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard 6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize flood blight areas 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 9 reserve sufficient floodplain area for the conveyance of flood flows so that flood heights and velocities will not be increased substantially 10 ensure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance national flood insurance program 29108 572018 boundaries of floodplain districts a the areas of special flood hazard identified by the federal insurance administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled flood insurance study for the city dated  with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article the maps shall be referenced in this article as the official floodplain zoning map the boundaries of the floodway floodway fringe and general floodplain districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official floodplain zoning map when an interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries the zoning administrator or his official designee shall make the necessary interpretation any person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case and submit technical evidence b there shall be established and maintained by the zoning administrator of the city the official floodplain zoning map which shall indicate thereon or encompass the boundaries of the floodway floodway fringe and general floodplain districts provided for by this article the floodplain management regulations found within this article shall apply only within the floodway floodway fringe and general floodplain districts and shall be null and void and of no effect in areas not being mapped as being included in such districts it is not intended by this article to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this article imposes greater restrictions the provisions of this article shall prevail 29109 572018
