situation as the situation becomes more intense measures will be taken to defuse the situation and return the area to normalcy 2 intensity reduction phase in the event the potential emergency

obtained given all the conditions and variables influencing that particular situation 3 restoration of order phase the ultimate goal and the third phase is the restoration of law and order law and order is a relative term that can generally be equated to the state of normalcy in the community longterm maintenance of law and order will be the goal control force which accomplishes immediate control at the price of increased social hostilities and potentially greater violence will be avoided and alternate responses sought based on an estimate of the situation at that time b duties and

of adjustment may grant a variance it shall make the following three findings which shall be recorde permanent record of the case and shall include the factual reasons on which they are based a that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this article in order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships the board must find that the five following conditions exist 1 if he complies with the provisions of this article the applicant can secure no reasonable return from nor make reasonable use of his property merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting a variance moreover the board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this article that will make possible the reasonable use of his property 2 the hardship results from the application of this article to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship 3 the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property 4 the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates this article or who purchases the property after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived and then comes to the board for relief 5 the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread if other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice b that the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this article and preserves its spirit c that in the granting the variance the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been accomplished the board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health safety or general welfare 3 in granting the variance the board may attach such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed building structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this article if a variance for the construction alteration or use of property is granted such construction alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan 4 the board of adjustment shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application 5 a variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six months from the date of the decision 6 if the application calls for the granting of a major variance and if the board of adjustment decides in favor of granting the variance the board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed the preliminary record of the hearing shall include

proposed decision including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit the preliminary record shall be sent to the environmental management commission for its review as follows a if the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure no reasonable return from nor make any practical use of the property 85228  randleman nc ordinances unless the proposed variance is granted  and the variance if granted will not result in a serious threat to the water supply then the commission shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations the commission shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the board of adjustment if the commission approves the variance as proposed the board shall prepare a final decision granting the proposed variance if the commission approves the variance with conditions and stipulations the board shall prepare a final decision including such conditions and stipulations granting the proposed variance b if the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property without the variance  or the variance if granted will result in a serious threat to the water supply then the commission shall deny approval of the variance as proposed the commission shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the board of adjustment the board shall prepare a
