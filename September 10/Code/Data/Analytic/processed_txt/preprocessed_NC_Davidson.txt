disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  1101995 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or

impede the flow of floodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at or above or below their locations along the floodway  6 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  7 to provide sufficient drainage courses to carry abnormal flows of stormwater in periods of heavy precipitations  8 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  9 to meet the needs of the stream to carry floodwaters and protect the creek channels and floodplains from encroachment so that flood heights and flood damage will not be increased  10 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and 11 to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area c this article is intended to permit only that development within the floodplain which is

this regulation or this ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the floodplain regulations of davidson north carolina  statutory authorization the legislature of the state of north carolina has in of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare  findings of fact the flood hazard areas of davidson and davidsons land use jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life increased health and safety hazards destruction of property and disruption of commerce and governmental services inundation from flood waters results in public expenditures for flood protection flood disaster relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages floodplain overlay 18 district sections 181 general 1 182 definitions 3 183 general provisions 13 184 administration and enforcement 14 185 appeals and variances 22 186

it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  objectives the regulations of the special flood hazard areas herein set forth are intended to protect areas of designated floodplains subject to and necessary for regulating flood waters and to permit and encourage the retention of openland uses which will be so located and designed as to constitute a harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the town as provided in the comprehensive plans as such are adopted and amended from time to time the specific intent in establishing special flood hazard areas composed of floodways and flood fringe areas includes the following a to control uses such as fill dumping storage of materials structures buildings and any other works which acting alone or in combination with other existing or future uses would cause damaging flood heights and velocities by obstructing flows and reducing floodplain storage  b to protect human life and health  c to minimize the expenditure of public money for costly floodcontrol projects  d to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  e to permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in flood hazard areas and to assure such permitted uses will not impede the flow of flood waters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at or above or below their locations along the floodways  f to minimize prolonged business interruptions  g to protect existing drainage courses that carry abnormal flows of stormwater in periods of heavy precipitations  h to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains  floodplain overlay district i 182 definitions town of davidson nc d a v i d s o n p l a n n i

be increased  j to inform existing and potential property owners that property is in a special flood hazard area as well as the associated flood risks and development restrictions  k to minimize future flood losses by depicting community flood fringe areas on the flood insurance rate maps and  l to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas this ordinance is intended to permit only that development within the floodplain which is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and presents a reasonable social and economic use of land in relation to the hazards involved the regulations hereinafter set forth shall apply to all property located within the special flood hazard area as shown on the flood insurance rate maps
