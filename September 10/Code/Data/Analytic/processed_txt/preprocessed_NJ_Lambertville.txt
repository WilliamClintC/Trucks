the lawful and reasonable order or instructions of any such officer  49 curfew  491 findings and purpose 1990 2 the mayor and council of the city of lambertville hereby finds there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision normally provided by certain parents and guardians for juveniles under 18 years of age resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior including vandalism noisy and rowdy behavior breaking and entering public drinking and littering and harassment of residents the mayor and council further finds that the offensive activities of the juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances because the activities are easily concealed whenever police officers are present and that the establishment of reasonable curfew regulations will enable the community to better control the free and unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles the mayor and council further finds and has determined that a curfew meets a very real local need and that curfew ordinances in other communities have been a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency a curfew in lambertville is particularly appropriate in view of the basic residential nature of the community and the sense of the community that there is a proper time for the cessation of outdoor activities of juveniles that sense of the community is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this section which takes into consideration also the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of juveniles with potential risks incident to immaturity the mayor and council further finds that the community is not overcrowded and that there has been a decrease in the school population over the past years commercial recreational facilities are limited and there is little or nothing for juveniles to do outdoors but roam the streets after the curfew hours which this section establishes lambertville is basically a family community parental responsibilities for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm by a substantial majority of the community legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness in many communities over the years the mayor and council has determined that as parental control increases there is a likelihood that juvenile delinquency decreases that there is a need for nocturnal curfew for juveniles in lambertville and that the establishment of a curfew applicable to juveniles will reinforce the primary authority and  48 adopting ordinance  491 ao107 responsibility of parents and guardians over juveniles in

association with the delaware and raritan canal and its long history of settlement that has resulted in the rich and diverse architectural character of a riverfront town design standards are necessary to preserve this rich history by providing guidance to property owners in the renovation of existing structures and the development of new buildings the following guidelines and standards shall be used to prepare and review the physical visual and spatial character and overall appearance of site plan and subdivision applications for development in relation to the specific streetscape adjacent buildings and the central business district in general in this section guidelines are overall principles to be used in the design of sites standards are to be followed in the placement and design of buildings unless specifically waived by the approving authority a design guidelines 1 consideration of context the design of a building or structure shall be undertaken with clear and reasonable regard for adjacent and nearby buildings setbacks streetscape open spaces and site improvements 2 continuation of design elements existing architectural and urban design elements shall be used as guidelines in the overall design of a building or structure the physical visual and spatial characteristics of immediate and nearby buildings or structures shall be reinforced use of architectural and urban design elements to achieve a coherent organized development pattern within a blocks area 3 retention of historical context the distinguishing original qualities or character of the streetscape should not be altered by the removal or alteration of historic buildings or their architectural features buildings and structures should be recognized as products of a particular time or era and not altered to appear like another period b design standards 1 building mass the massing and height of the building should be similar to the ones that make up the rest of the streetscape example a one story ranch house would be incompatible with 2 1 2 story houses 2 building proportion the relationship of the buildings height to width in the front facade should be proportioned to be the same as nearby buildings example a low and wide prairie style house would be incompatible with narrow and tall federal or greek revival proportions characteristic of lambertville  z4066 lambertville code  z4066 ao528 3 architectural elements the elements in the facade such as windows doors sidelights and projections from it such as porches balconies or portecocheres should be proportional in height and width both within themselves and in relationship to the supporting wall as other structures in the streetscape example wide picture windows are incompatible with queen anne style windows which feature tall and narrow profiles 4 element spacing the spacing and size of exterior wall to the elements in the facade should be compatible with adjacent and nearby buildings examples modern windows which wrap corners are incompatible with prewwii buildings which lack this technological advantage a pent roof should not be larger than the roof of an addition or main roof 5 streetscape rhythm the relationship of the new building to side yards and the setback from the street should be similar to the existing pattern of development examples buildings should be set in line with the front edge of existing buildings side yards should be narrower than the width of the lot on which the building sits 6 building materials the use of building materials their texture and color should be visually compatible with existing buildings in the district example vinyl siding with an embossed wood grain is incompatible with wooden clapboard siding which is planed smooth 7 roof lines the shape roof line and slope of roofs including dormers chimneys and other projections should be compatible with nearby structures roof lines are a particularly important design feature because they strongly convey the mass of the building example a low pitched gable roof is incompatible with the mansard roof of the second empire style 8 landscape elements landscape elements such as individual trees and tree masses walls fencing and other materials should be compatible with the existing views from the street example a wooden stockade fence would not be compatible with wrought iron chain link fencing should not be used at all 9 ornamental features the exterior features of a building including ornamentation should be visually compatible with the architectural era of nearby buildings  z4066 adopting ordinance

of the environmental impacts associated with development on steep slopes and includes a map entitled slopes which depicts the areas of steep slope and their relative gradients lands which slope greater than 15% are widely recognized to warrant special development standards in order to protect properties below the steep slopes from nuisances such as stormwater flooding and slope erosion with sediment and debris deposition to minimize the cost of public services and facilities related to new development to preserve significant woodlands and wildlife habitat and to preserve natural visual amenities such as ridgelines and scenic vistas the special requirements of steep slopes have been recognized by the nj state planning commission the nj department of environmental protection and

alternatives to detention basins 1 tanks infiltration pits dry wells or other acceptable methods may be used for the purpose with appropriate consideration for groundwater pollution potential length of life and feasibility of continued maintenance consistent with njdep regulations and guidelines it is not necessary that stormwater management requirements be satisfied by means of detention basins the use of infiltration systems is recommended for the full water quality storm volume whenever possible certain types of infiltration practices are subject to the njdep discharge to groundwater regulations 2 nonstructural management practices such as cluster land use development open space acquisition conservation of agricultural and critical constraint lands stream encroachment and flood hazard control should be coordinated with detention requirements 3 volume control is encouraged such as trenches and dry wells infiltration facilities must be carefully analyzed for permeability of soil seasonal high water table and necessity for pretreatment of sediments in order to prevent clogging even more important it is absolutely essential that possible groundwater contamination be taken into account 4 the applicant will demonstrate that a there is at least three feet or more vertical separation between the bottom of the infiltration facility and the seasonal high water table proven by soil logs taken in the location of the proposed basin   z5223 adopting ordinance  z5224 ao601  z5225 flood and erosion control standards b the soil texture is sand loamy sand or sandy loam as described by the us department of agriculture soil permeability testing is required in the location of the proposed basin  c runoff is pretreated to remove tss total suspended solids prior to discharge into the infiltration facility  d the infiltration basin bottom is scarified after the basin is formed after which no machinery or equipment may enter within the basin  e the entire volume of runoff generated by the water quality design storm is contained in the infiltration facility and recharged into the ground within 72 hours  f an analysis is provided to demonstrate the safety and stability resulting from excess flows from the facility in the event of an outlet failure  g provision is made for additional capacity capable of holding an estimated 20 years of suspended load that bypasses pretreatment calculations shall be in accordance with the new jersey stormwater best management practice manual february 200 stormwater pollutant removal criteria 5 detention basins and berms may be seeded with a wildflower mix or planted with appropriate vegetation provided the function is not compromised a detention facilities a detention facility should accommodate site runoff generated from two ten and 100year twentyfourhour storms considered individually in each case a type iii rainfall as defined in soil conservation service publications runoff greater than that occurring from the 100year twentyfourhour storm will be passed over an emergency spillway or a bypass system detention will be provided such that after development the peak rate of flow from the site will not exceed the corresponding flows from the site prior to development detention basins alone do not reduce the increased volume of runoff caused by development  therefore the discharge rate must minimally be adjusted to safely control the increased volume it is possible for flooding in a given watershed to be aggravated by the combined effects of detention basins if the basins are improperly placed detention basins located in downstream areas hold back peak flows so that the flow coincides with the peak flow from upstream this situation must be investigated with supporting calculations of  z5224 lambertville code  z5225 ao602 downstream effects water quality controls are required at a minimum in all cases detention basins with a permanent pool of water must provide safety ledges andor gently sloping sides provisions must be made for proper water circulation control of algae insect control and continued maintenance including dredging to maintain proper depth dry detention basins should be shaped to blend with the natural topography the bottom of the dry detention basin must be at least two feet vertically above the seasonal high groundwater table dry detention basins are to be graded to provide a positive overland flow unless in the case of plunge pools or scour holes underdrains may be considered for assisting positive drainage b outlet devices in all cases multiple level outlets or other fully automatic outlets are to be designed so that discharge rates from the development for the design storms will not be increased from what would occur if the development were not constructed outlet waters must be discharged from the development at such locations and velocities as not to cause additional erosion or cause additional channels downstream of the development no outlets will be permitted directly into adjacent lands without proof of a zero increase in the rate of runoff and a stability analysis of the offsite channel if there is no stable outlet downstream an offsite easement must be obtained to provide a stable outlet outlets from detention facilities are to be designed to function without manual electric or mechanical controls location of the principal outlet should allow for easy vehicle access the outlet structure must be designed to withstand all anticipated pressures andor loadings outlet structures will involve multistage outlet systems the lowest outlet will be designed to achieve prolonged retention requirements for water quality control the remaining outlets located above the water quality peak detention pool elevation must control the required design storms debris and sediment will accumulate around the outlet structure trash racks with hinges or other devices are required to protect the outlet from clogging the inclined vertical bar rack is recommended for the lower stage outlets to facilitate debris removal the inside of the outlet structure should be depressed below the lowest outlet to minimize clogging of this outlet due to sedimentation c dams any stormwater basin that impounds water use of an artificial dike levee or other barrier may be subject to the new jersey dam safety standards all such dams must be designed constructed operated and maintained in compliance with said standards and all  z5225 adopting ordinance  z5225 ao603 other applicable laws and approved by the new jersey department of environmental protection the minimum top width of the embankment must be 10 feet side slopes of the settled embankment should not be less than three horizontal to one vertical the minimum elevation to the top of the settled embankment must be one foot above the water surface created by the maximum design storm passing over the emergency spillway in a completely clogged outlet structure condition design height of the basin embankment is required to be increased 10% where hauling equipment is used and 5% where compaction equipment is used d emergency spillways emergency spillways are required on all detention basins and will be designed to pass the entire scs 100year twentyfourhour postdeveloped peak discharge tributary to the detention basin at a minimum detention basins with dams subject to njac  the new jersey dam safety standards must comply with those emergency spillway requirements emergency spillways are to be located in cut sections wherever possible stable channels must be provided to convey stormwater emergency spillway to the discharge points discharge from the emergency spillway must also not cause soil instability both onsite and offsite e offsite drainage stormwater runoff from areas offsite may be passed across the development site without detention if the offsite drainage enters the detention facility provided for the development the detention facility design must handle this additional flow a point of interest analysis is encouraged to determine the change in runoff downstream of the site f uncontrolled runoff since it is difficult to control 100% of the development site stormwater runoff provisions must be made to regulate uncontrolled runoff to the maximum extent practical uncontrolled runoff is stormwater flow not tributary to detention basins or other stormwater control facilities on the development site the total peak runoff from the site after development cannot exceed predeveloped rates at all locations leaving the site therefore uncontrolled runoff will be allowed only if 1 the stormwater control facilities onsite are adequately sized to reduce the composite summation of controlled and uncontrolled peak rates of runoff to below predeveloped conditions for each tributary location offsite  z5225 lambertville code  z5225 ao604  z5226 interpretation if the terms of this section shall be in conflict with those of

planning and design llc 2 the uncontrolled runoff will not exceed predeveloped peak rates at the point of discharge uncontrolled runoff must be limited to overland and swale flows g joint detention facilities in many instances the provisions of separate detention facilities for a number of single sites may be more expensive and more difficult to maintain than provisions of joint facilities for a number of sites in such cases the city may be willing to consider provisions of joint detention facilities which will fulfill the requirements of this regulation in such cases the city may approve a properly planned staged program of detention facilities h detention facilities in flood hazard areas detention facilities proposed within flood hazard areas are required to be designed in accordance

requirements of this  1500 or the stormwater management plan the waiver may be granted where an applicant has demonstrated the inability or impracticality of strict compliance with  150 andor the stormwater management plan upon the following conditions the applicant must demonstrate one of the following 1 an inability to apply any of the best management practices and methodologies as defined and approved herein and in the stormwater management plan due to an extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely affecting the subject property or the structures thereon resulting in a peculiar and exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship  or 2 that the purposes of this  1500 and stormwater management plan can be advanced by a deviation from the best management practices and methodologies as defined and approved herein and in the stormwater management plan where the benefits of such deviation substantially outweigh any detriment in requesting a waiver as to any application the applicant may submit as reasons for the waiver the site conditions of the proposed project including soils types  thin soil cover  low permeability soils andor shallow depths to groundwater high groundwater levels unique conditions which would create an unsafe design or conditions which would provide a detrimental impact to public health welfare or safety the waiver cannot be granted due to conditions created by the applicant if the applicant can comply with the requirements of  1500 and the stormwater management plan of the size of the project the hardship is selfimposed and the board lacks jurisdiction to grant any waiver under this section the applicant must propose a suitable mitigation method of a mitigation plan which will conform as closely as possible to the design and performance standards of this  150 or nonstructural stormwater management measures governing stormwater quality quantity and groundwater recharge the mitigation plan shall include sufficient data and analyses including an alternatives analysis which demonstrate how onsite compliance is to be maximized the mitigation plan must provide stormwater management results compatible with the same huc14 watershed within which the subject project is proposed alternatively the mitigation plan may 1 provide for funding toward an offsite or regional stormwater control project if available and practicable or 2 fund an analysis to determine a more appropriate mitigation method to be presented to the board for approval  or 3 provide for equivalent treatment at an alternate location or 4 provide some other  z150013 adopting ordinance  z150013 ao671 equivalent water quality benefit if an onsite method is not proposed provided the results required herein are achieved the applicant shall be responsible for locating an appropriate site for mitigation of the performance section for which the waiver is sought the funding option shall be allowed only in situations where there will be no immediate impact upon a sensitive receptor contribution to a regional municipal or offsite mitigation plan shall be allowed for any application for one individual singlefamily residence when approved by the board receipt of the financial contribution shall be deemed to satisfy the mitigation requirement for that application the board having jurisdiction over the individual application may determine that due to the size of the project necessary to mitigate for the waiver it is not practical to require a mitigation project in all instances the board having jurisdiction over the application shall have the power to impose additional conditions as may be appropriate under the circumstances of the application the board shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions consistent with this section 1 showing the inability or impracticality of strict compliance with  1500 and the stormwater management plan and 2 justifying the approval of the applicants
