accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the borough and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment  07  01  2011  3252 stormwater management  3254  3252 purpose  the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and welfare within the borough by minimizing the damages described in  325la of this chapter designed to a manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems b utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems c encourage recharge of groundwater where appropriate and prevent degradation of groundwater quality d maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the borough and the commonwealth e preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams f provide proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater management facilities and bmps that are constructed in the borough g provide performance standards and design criteria for watershedwide stormwater management and planning h meet legal water quality requirements under state law including

5826039  07012011 preface history birdsboro was named after its founder william bird who took warrants for land on haycreek road and later ~ix penny creek as early as 173 7 on the banks of hay creek he established a forge in about 174 which was followed by other forges along the creek as well as a sawmill and gristmill between 1737 and 175 he took up warrants for about 1600 acres of land he died in 1761 marcus bird a son succeeded his father he enlarged his fathers work in haycreek and built a furnace on french creek at hopewell he was the largest producer of iron in america during the revolutionary war when berks county was constituted in 176 birdsboro was already a town of considerable size in 179 matthew brooke purchased all of the lands owned by the bird family including all forges and mills matthew brooke died in 1821 and his two sons became exclusive owners in 183 7 they later became organized in to the e & g brooke iron co and their influence made the growth of the town possible the borough of birdsboro has over the years passed process of legislative change common to many american communities while only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the borough subsequent growth of the community together with the complexity of modern life has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the borough the recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collection of these records is an important step in this evercontinuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records it must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept uptodate it was with thoughts such as these in mind that the borough council ordered the following codification of the borough s legislation contents of various chapters of the all currently effective legislation of a general and permanent nature enacted by the borough council of the borough of birdsboro including revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the borough council in the course of the codification 07  01  2011 birdsboro code division of divided into parts administrative legislation contains all borough legislation of an administrative nature namely that dealing with the administration of government that establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the municipal government and its departments general legislation contains all other borough legislation of a regulatory nature items of legislation in this part generally impose penalties for violation of their provisions whereas those in do not table of contents and grouping of legislation the table of contents details the arrangement of material alphabetically by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter the use of article designations has preserved the identity of the individual enactments and the titles of the articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate location of the individual enactments reserved chapters unassigned chapter numbers do not appear in the table of contents but are available for assignment to new enactments in this manner new subject matter can be included alphabetically pagination a unique pagenumbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit the first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a colon and the numeral l thus would begin on  1 by use of this system it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter or add new chapters without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages numbering of chapterrelated sectionnumbering system is employed in which the section number indicates the number of the chapter and the location of the section within that chapter thus the first section of would be 301 while the sixth section of would be 576 scheme the scheme is the list of section titles that precedes the text of each chapter these titles are carefully written so that taken together they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter taken separately each describes the content of a particular section for ease and precision of reference the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text 11 07012011 preface histories at the end of the scheme list of section titles in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter this history indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived including the enactment number if pertinent and the date of adoption in the case of chapters containing parts or articles derived from more than one item of legislation the source of each part or article is indicated in the text under its title amendments to individual sections or subsections are indicated by histories
