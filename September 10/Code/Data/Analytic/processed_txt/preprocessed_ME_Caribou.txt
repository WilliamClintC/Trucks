was repealed by city council on  historical note adopted by city council on   chamber of commerce repealed by city council  effective  article ii tax increment financing introduction state of maine law establishes tax increment financing tif as one of the few tools cities can use to assist in economic development activities tifs provide partnering opportunities between private developers and local government to realize greater economic benefits for the community these efforts may include new developments redevelopment or expansion of existing business operations while tifs provide the potential for cash influx to projects other tools may also be beneficial and should be seriously considered when requests for tif designation are made these other tools may include changing zoning or land use regulations streamlining review processes helping to get funding economic agencies private funding or city revolving loan funds utility services programs etc the city of caribou will generally consider use of tifs for all areas zoned for commercial development in an effort to build community and economic growth partnerships with both existing and new businesses special consideration will be given to projects proposed in the downtown district purpose the purpose of these guidelines is to outline standards that the city of caribou will use in considering applications for tax increment financing these guidelines are intended to be consistent with state laws as they may be updated from time to time state laws shall be utilized when any specific conflict between the two occurs notwithstanding these guidelines the creation of a tif agreement is a policy decision made on a casebycase basis by the caribou city council and the maine department of economic & community development tax increment financing is a not a right under maine law and meeting these guidelines should not be interpreted as creating any rights or entitlements in any application 589 definitions the following terms as may be used within this shall have the following meanings those terms which are not included herein but which are found in maine revised statutes title 30a pertaining to development districts within municipalities shall have the same meaning as provided in the state statutes commercial and industrial zones those land use zones adopted by the city of caribou which allow for uses of a primarily nonresidential nature retail those establishments identified as retail trade and wholesale trade under the 2017 north american industry classification system general considerations economic development projects are eligible for consideration when they meet the following standards  would not occur otherwise   create or retain employment opportunities   expand significantly the citys tax base  and  conform to the quality and types of development sought by the city as outlined in the zoning ordinance comprehensive plan and other policies enacted by the city council basic provisions once a tif district is created the city of caribou can utilize increment funds in two ways  first the city may bond for and install public infrastructure to be paid for with any generated tax increment funds and second the city may return tax increment funds directly to the investing business to cover project costs this second option is formalized credit enhancement agreement cea between the city and the benefiting parties because of the potential risk to the city in either of these cases special consideration needs to be given to the following 1 tax increment financing shall be revenue neutral or better to the city over the life of the district 2 applicants must provide all documentation deemed necessary by the city to substantiate the tif requirements and protect the citys economic and financial position 3 the applicant is obligated to apply for any state reimbursement programs for personal property andor real estate taxes 4 all applicants will be required to sign a professional fee consent form agreeing to reimburse the city for all outofpocket expenses including outside professional consulting costs eg legal accounting and advertising and expenses related to calling special council meetings printed documents travel postage etc which may be incurred as a result of the tax increment financing proposal such reimbursement is to occur whether or not tax increment financing is approved 590 5 if tax increment financing is approved an annual administrative fee equal to 1% of the incremental taxes reallocated back to the project will be charged 6 credit enhancement agreements must provide for a recapture of the benefits if the project should move to another municipality assignments will be allowed only for conventional commercial financing purposes or where the proposed assignee agrees to be bound by the same terms and conditions as the original applicant 7 invoices cancelled checks lien waivers and other documents supporting cost reimbursement proportional to the captured value must be substantiated with documentation from nonaffiliated companies 8 tax increment financing agreements of five years or less are highly preferred by the city when structured as a cea increased duration may be considered depending upon the magnitude of increased tax value job creation or economic benefits projects involving bonds for public infrastructure may be considered for the maximum time allowed by law 30 years 9 the city will not entertain requests from retail enterprises for credit enhancement agreements as a means of tax increment financing for onsite activities within a tif district unless such businesses or developments will create a minimum of 10 new full time equivalent fte jobs which pay 100% of the area median income  the city may however at its sole discretion consider requests from all retail enterprises for credit enhancement agreements to assist in the financing of necessary offsite public infrastructure improvements installed by the investing business and for which detailed financial documentation is provided 10 the city will not return to any investing business under any credit enhancement agreement more than eighty 80 percent in any one 1 given year 11 the city may deviate from provisions 810 when working with a project that will redevelop or repurpose properties held by a nontaxed entity for at least 5 years immediately prior to application for tif designation eg tax acquired properties school sites state holdings etc mandatory guidelines in all instances applicants for tax increment financing must demonstrate that the city of caribous participation is economically necessary and that participation is needed to undertake the project such justification is demonstrated by 1 a need to offset infrastructure costs unique to the site  or 2 a need to offset economic advantages available to a corporate entity if it should develop a project or expand operations outside of caribou  or 3 a lack of sufficient private or other public funding sources to meet the full capital investments needed to undertake a project 4 if the project creates significant

existing employment opportunities  2 the project creates longterm permanent and quality employment opportunities which will provide wages exceeding the area median income  3 the project contributes to the revitalization of the downtown district commercial and industrial zones designated growth areas or pine tree zone district 4 the project improves a blighted building or site in need of rehabilitation  5 the project creates public infrastructure facilities that have application beyond the particular development such as improvements to utilities telecommunications traffic patterns

establishment of districts 1 zoning districts a for the purposes of this the city is hereby divided into the following zoning districts 1 r1 residential district the r1 district encompasses most of the older residential neighborhoods and is located within convenient reach of business facilities the district is expected to contain most of higher density singlefamily type dwellings likely to be needed by the community certain additional uses which meet the requirements of this be permitted which will contribute to balanced neighborhoods and enhance the attractiveness of the community 2 r2 residential district the r2 district encompasses most of the older residential neighborhoods and is located within convenient reach of business facilities the r2 district is expected to contain most of the multifamily or apartment type dwellings likely to be needed by the community however in harmony with the established neighborhoods predominant land use will probably continue to be singlefamily residence as in the r1 district certain additional uses which meet the requirements of this be permitted which contribute to balanced neighborhoods and enhance the attractiveness of the community 3 r3 residential district the r3 district encompasses most of the area outside the urban center and is intended for the kinds of uses which have traditionally predominated in rural new england  forestry and farming farm residence and a scattering of varied uses not inconsistent with a generally open nonintensive pattern of land use the minimum lot size requirement is high in order to prevent overdevelopment where public sewers are not feasible and where a full range of urban services can not be provided economically 4 c1 commercial district the c1 district is intended primarily for commercial uses to which the public requires easy and frequent access centrally located and at the center of the existing downtown business district the c1 district is intended to encourage the concentration of commercial development to the mutual advantage of customers and merchants in order to protect the integrity of the c1 commercial zone residential dwelling space is not allowed on the first floor street level of buildings in the c1 zone accessory and incidental residential dwelling units may be developed on the floors other than the first floor street level with site design review and planning board approval no residential dwelling units maybe developed in the basement below street level unless the entire building is constructed of approved noncombustible materials and in compliance with the maine uniform building and energy mubec as type 1 or type 2 construction any residential dwelling unit in the c1zone must meet all requirements of site design review 13700 general requirements for land use all requirements of the life safety nfpa 101 and all requirements of the caribou building the maine uniform building and energy mubec 5 c2 commercial district the c2 district is intended primarily for commercial uses to which the public requires free and easy access and to provide for a wider range of associated activities in the business community than in the c1 district in order to protect the integrity of the c2 commercial zone residential dwelling units are not allowed on the first floor street level of buildings in the c2 zone accessory and incidental residential dwelling units may be developed on the floors other than the first floor accessory and incidental residential dwelling units may be developed on the first floor street level with site design review and planning board approval accessory and incidental residential dwelling units may be developed on the first floor only if 50% or greater floor space is maintained for commercial use with site design review and planning board approval any residential dwelling unit in the c2 zone must meet all requirements of site design review 13700 general requirements for land use all requirements of the life safety nfpa 101 and all requirements of the caribou building the maine uniform building and energy mubec 771 6 rc2 commercial district the rc2 district is intended for commercial uses to which the public requires free and easy access the lot size requirements are larger than other commercial districts since the area may not be serviced by public sewer and the set back requirements are greater since most rc2 districts are expected to be along major traveled roads 7 i1 industrial district the i1 district is to provide land which is conveniently located with respect to transportation and municipal services and where other conditions are favorable to the development of industry and which at the same time is so located as to prevent undesirable conflict with residential and business uses 8 i2 industrial district the i2 district is to provide land which is conveniently located to transportation facilities for business activities which require extensive land area but do not require close proximity to residential and commercial areas of the community and to promote such land use in the community while at the same time locating such activity as to prevent undesirable conflict with residential and business uses and reduce traffic congestion in these areas 9 h1 health related district the h1 district is intended primarily for health use or uses compatible with a hospital or healthrelated purpose located in the proximity of the cary medical center the h1 district is intended to encourage the concentration of medically related development for efficient land use b special

permitting authority as that for a new structure if such addition or expansion does not increase the nonconformity of the structure and is in accordance with subparagraphs a and b below a after  if any portion of a structure is less than the required setback from the normal highwater line of a water body or tributary stream or the upland edge of a wetland that portion of the structure shall not be expanded as measured in floor area or volume by 30% or more during the lifetime of the structure if a replacement structure conforms with the requirements of c3 and is less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland the replacement structure may not be expanded if the original structure existing on  had been expanded by 30% in floor area and volume since that date 822 b whenever a new enlarged or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee basing its decision on the criteria specified in c2 relocation below if the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure except for expansion in conformity with c1a above and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three 3 additional feet as measured from the uphill side of the structure from original ground level to the bottom of the first floor sill it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure 2 relocation a

practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting shall be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three 3 feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the

least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 3 reconstruction or replacement any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed or damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction

replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement 823 structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c1 above as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with c2 above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider in addition to the criteria in c2 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 4 change of use of a nonconforming structure the use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the planning board after receiving a written application determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water
