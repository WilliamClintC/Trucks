related subject are compiled this about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the

transportation mitigation fee   transportation mitigation fee a the city council of the city finds that future development within the city and within the coachella valley to the year 2010 will result in traffic volumes in excess of capacity on the regional system of streets arterials and highways now existing b the city council finds that failure to expand the capacity of the existing circulation system will cause unacceptable levels of congestion on the streets and arterials of the regional system c the city council also finds and declares that in the absence of this chapter imposing a fair share traffic fee upon new development existing and future sources of revenue are inadequate to fund substantial portions of the regional transportation system improvements needed to avoid unacceptable levels of congestion and related adverse impacts d the city council finds that exactions from development will construct only a portion of the local and regional facilities and that the adoption of this transportation uniform mitigation fee article will raise the additional revenues needed to construct the improvements to accommodate traffic that will be generated by development of land within the city and within the coachella valley e the city council also finds that the coachella valley area transportation study has determined the extent to which the new development of land will generate traffic volumes impacting the roadway system and that this chapter establishes a fair and equitable method for distributing the unfunded costs of transportation improvements necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by such development f the city council further finds that the regional transportation improvements and the transportation uniform mitigation fee established by this chapter are based on the findings of the 1987 coachella valley area transportation study whose policycommittee members represented all nine cities in the coachella valley and riverside county this study has established that growth in the year 2010 will affect the entire regional transportation system and therefore the area of impact for future development is the entire coachella valley as defined in this chapter the study made the following additional findings 1 population and employment within the coachella valley is expected to double by the year 2010 and would cause levels of service e and f as defined in the national academy of sciences 1964 highway capacity manual and as updated in the 1985 highway capacity manual special report 209 on existing streets and arterials 2 the coachella valley area transportation study shows that by the year 2010 the coachella valley will increasingly become a more integrated and interdependent valley most as intercity trips for both residents and visitors 3 the 1987 coachella valley area transportation study modeled and evaluated the effect of projected growth to the year 2010 on all major streets and highways in the coachella valley and found that without expansion the transportation system would suffer severe congestion further the study showed that the recommended transportation improvements would accommodate the traffic anticipated in the year 2010 at the desired level of service c 4 in the year 201 according to the coachella valley area transportation study the valley will remain a selfcontained community where jobs and the labor force are wellbalanced the increase in intercity travel however will result in an increase in average trip length 5 existing and future sources of public revenues are insufficient to fund all the needed transportation improvements 6 the revenues generated by this transportation mitigation fee will provide the additional funds necessary to construct the transportation improvements and provide the additional capacity needed by the year 2010 to accommodate the traffic generated by the development of land in the city and in the coachella valley 7 the transportation mitigation fee is a fair and equitable method of distributing the cost of transportation improvements among the developments which will generate the increased traffic g the city council adopts all findings and incorporates by reference all findings contained in the following reportsstudies attached as exhibits on file in the office of the city clerk 1 coachella valley area transportation study dated

adopted except that 3 are not adopted and chapters 3 25 and 2 and 11032 are adopted  11117   expressed findings the city of coachella finds the following the fire department hereby finds that the proposed amendments to the fire reasonable and necessary because of local climactic geologic and topographical conditions within the city of coachella this finding is supported and based upon the following express findings which address each of these conditions and present the local situation which make the proposed amendments necessary i climatic conditions a the city of coachella located in riverside county is located in southern california and covers a vast and varied geographic area the base climate in western riverside county consists of semiarid mediterranean weather patterns eastern riverside county is a desert area with mohave desert temperatures and weather patterns those two primary areas are divided by the san bernardino mountain range both areas outside of the mountain terrain annually experience extended periods of high temperatures with little or no precipitation hot dry winds which may reach speeds of 70 mph or greater are common to the area examples are santa anafoehn winds afternoon surfaceheating generated winds and prevailing desert winds these climatic conditions cause extreme drying of vegetation and common building materials frequent periods of drought and low humidity add to the fire danger this predisposes the area to large destructive fires conflagration which necessitates rapid identification locating and extinguishment of all fires in the smallest stage possible in addition to directly damaging or destroying buildings these fires are also prone to disrupt utility services throughout the county obstacles generated by a strong wind such as fallen trees street lights and utility poles will greatly impact the response time to reach an incident scene during these winds the inability to use aerial type firefighting apparatus would further decrease our ability to stop fires in large buildings and place rescue personnel at increased risk of injury b although riverside county and the city of coachella occasionally experiences periods of significant drought the county can also experience periods of substantial rainfall annual rainfall varying from three 3 inches in blythe to over thirty three 33 inches in pine cove when riverside county does experience heavy rain or rain over a period of days or weeks many areas of the county are subject to flooding runoff from rain drains either naturally into rivers washes and creeks or into flood control facilities flash flooding is also a common problem especially in the coachella valley and the easterly portions of the county flash flooding is typically associated with short duration high intensity precipitation events often associated with summer thunderstorms such events can occur even during a drought c water demand in densely populated southern california far exceeds the quantity supplied by natural precipitation  and although the population continues to grow the alreadytaxed water supply does not california is projected to increase in population by nearly ten million 10000000 over the next quarter of a century with fifty 50 percent of that growth centered in southern california due to storage capacities and consumption and a limited amount of rainfall future water allocation is not fully dependable this necessitates the need for additional and onsite fire protection features it would also leave tall buildings vulnerable to uncontrolled fires due to a lack of available water and an inability to pump sufficient quantities of available water to floors in a fire d these dry climatic conditions and winds contribute to the rapid spread of even small fires originating in highdensity housing or vegetation these fires spread very quickly and create a need for increased levels of fire protection the added protection of fire sprinkler systems and other fire protection features such as identification and notification will supplement normal fire department response by providing immediate protection for the building occupants and by containing and controlling the fire spread to the area of origin fire sprinkler systems will also reduce the use of water for firefighting by as much as fifty 50 to seventyfive 75 percent ii topographical conditions a natural the topographical conditions of riverside county varies from three hundred 300 feet below sealevel flat desert communities to mountains over ten thousand 10000 feet in alpinelike areas of the san bernardino mountain range in between these areas developable slopes of twentyfive 25 percent and greater generally occur throughout the foothills riverside county extends from orange county to the state of arizona and is mixed with congested urban areas rural lands and wild lands a large number of sensitive habitats for various animal species and vegetation consist within large open space areas between major urban centers that impact building and structure location which impedes emergency access and response this variety in regions contributes to an increased emergency response time which necessitates cooperation between local agencies b traffic and circulation congestion is an artificially created obstructive topographical condition which is common throughout riverside county c these topographical conditions combine to create a situation which places fire department response time to fire occurrences at risk and makes it necessary to provide automatic onsite fireextinguishing systems and other protection measures to protect occupants and property iii geological conditions located within riverside county are several known active and potentially active earthquake faults including the san andreas san jacinto and elsinore fault in the event of an earthquake the location of the epicenter as well as the time of day and season of the year would have a profound effect on the number of deaths and casualties as well as property damage the major form of direct damage from most earthquakes is damage to construction bridges are particularly vulnerable to collapse and dam failure may generate major downstream flooding buildings vary in susceptibility dependent upon construction and the types of soils on which they are built earthquakes destroy power and telephone lines  gas sewer or water mains  which in tum may set off fires andor hinder firefighting or rescue efforts the hazard of earthquakes varies from place to place dependent upon the regional and local geology ground shaking may occur in areas sixtyfive 65 miles or more from the epicenter the point on the ground surface above the focus ground shaking can change the mechanical properties of some fine grained saturated soils where upon they liquefy and act as a fluid liquefaction a previous earthquakes in southern california have been accompanied by disruption of traffic flow and fires a severe seismic event has the potential to negatively impact any rescue or fire suppression activities because it is likely to create obstacles similar to those indicated under the high wind section above with the probability of strong aftershocks there exists a need to provide increased protection for anyone on upper floors of buildings b road circulation features located throughout the county also make amendments reasonably necessary located county are major roadways highways and flood control channels that create barriers and slow response times hills slopes street and storm drain design accompanies with occasional heavy rainfall causes roadway flooding and landslides and at times may make an emergency access route impassable there are areas in riverside county that naturally have extended emergency response times that exceed the five minute goal california health and safety 7 and 189415 require that the modification or change be expressly marked and identified as to which each finding refers therefore the city council finds that the following table sets forth the 2016 california fire that have been modified and the associated local climatic

satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of  part 2008  part 2008 variance procedure   nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  part 2008  part 2008   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles iv and v of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the riverside county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  part 2008  part 2008   appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or

system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  part 2008  part 2008 appendix appendices 10 alluvial fan advisory hazards of alluvial fan development alluvial fans present a unique flood hazard environment where the combination of sediment slope and topography create an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not provide reliable protection active alluvial fan flooding is characterized by flow path uncertainty combined with abrupt deposition and erosion as a result any area of an alluvial fan may be subject to intense flood hazards the technology of mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of water and debris flows for alluvial fans is still in the early development stage the federal emergency management agency fema has formulated a mapping procedure for the purpose of defining the likelihood of flood hazards on inundated alluvial fan zones to be used for flood insurance purposes and general floodplain regulation referred to as the fema alluvial fan methodology an active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three related criteria a flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex  b abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or debris flow loses its competence to carry material eroded from a steeper upstream source area  and c an environment where the combination of sediment availability slope and topography creates an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not reliably mitigate the risk inactive alluvial fan flooding is similar to traditional riverine flood hazards but occurs only on alluvial fans it is characterized by flow paths with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in the reliable mitigation of the hazard counter to active alluvial fan flooding hazards an inactive alluvial fan flooding hazard is characterized by relatively stable flow paths however areas of inactive alluvial fan flooding as with active alluvial fan flooding may be subject to sediment deposition and erosion but to a degree that does not cause flow path instability and uncertainty an alluvial fan may exhibit both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive alluvial fan flooding hazards the hazards may vary spatially or vary at the same location contingent on the level of flow discharge spatially for example upstream inactive portions of the alluvial fan may distribute flood flow to active areas at the distal part of the alluvial fan hazards may vary at the same location for example with a flow path that may be stable for lower flows but become unstable at higher flows more detailed information can be found at femas website guidelines for determining flood hazards on alluvial fans at  alluvial fans and lomrs the nfip does not allow for the removal of land from the floodplain based on the placement of fill lomrf in alluvial fan flood hazard areas the nfip will credit a major structural flood control project lomr process that will effectively eliminate alluvial fan flood hazards from the protected area details about map revisions for alluvial fan areas can be found in the federal regulations at title 44 alluvial fan task force as stated in ab 2141 longville statutes of 2004 the state of california department of water resources will convene an alluvial fan task force aftf the aftf will produce an alluvial fan model ordinance for local communities and a recommendations report to the legislature as of march 200 the ordinance and report are projected to be completed by 2007 20 higher standards recommended by the state of california this ordinance meets the minimum standards required to participate in the national flood insurance program community adoption of higher standards can be applied towards credit under the community rating system crs program and result in reduced premiums

and nonconforming development standards or performance standards 2 to specify the circumstances and conditions under which nonconformities may continue to exist 3 to limit the number and extent of nonconformities by prohibiting or limiting their enlargement or extension  their reestablishment after abandonment  and their alteration or restoration after partial destruction 4 to discourage the survival of nonconformities where they adversely affect the intent and purpose of this chapter and the general plan or the maintenance development use enjoyment or economic values of other property in the vicinity 5 to set time limits on the continuance of nonconformities based upon the nature of the use the character age and value of the development and the degree of friction or objectionableness b definitions 1 nonconformities nonconformities shall consist of three major classifications either singly or in combination a nonconforming uses b nonconforming development standards and c nonconforming performance standards 2 nonconforming use the use of land or structures which use was previously lawful but which no longer complies with the applicable district regulations where the

structures or only minor structures are on the land 4 nonconforming development standards and performance standards land activities and structures are subject to numerous standards most of which are defined in physical terms and subject to measurement a nonconforming standard of use occurs when a use or structure which was previously lawful no longer complies with certain standards either as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or as a result of subsequent applicable amendments the applicable standards are development standards a project area minimum  b project

affecting nonconformities shall begin on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or subsequent amendments thereto or changes in the zoning map whichever is the cause of such nonconformity exceptions to the time period calculation are those periods affecting types of nonconformities which are slated for termination by age and type of structure rather than by the date of this chapter b contamination nonconformities may be continuously maintained provided there is no alteration or addition to any structure nor any enlargement of area space or volume occupied by such nonconformity except as otherwise provided in this chapter c maintenance ordinary repairs and maintenance may be made to a nonconformity subject to the following provisions 1 maintenance shall not include structural alterations except those required by law or except those to make the structure and use conform to the standards and use regulations of the district in which it is located 2 in any period of twelve 12 consecutive months work may be done on any structure which is subject to nonconformity regulations on ordinary repairs or on repairs or replacement of nonbearing walls fixtures

nonconformity be increased 3 nothing contained in these provisions shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any officer of the city charged with protecting the public safety upon order of such officer d enlargement extension or relocation a nonconformity shall not be enlarged in volume or extended

shall not be changed to another use except to a use permitted in the district in which the use is located or to another nonconforming use of the same nature or to a more restricted nonconforming use  provided that the planning commission either by general rule or by written findings in a specific case shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconformity such changes may be subject to conditions imposed by the commission  a change to another nonconforming use shall riot be construed to extend the termination date if any of the original nonconformity f nonconforming lot 1 in the rs or rm zones a singlefamily dwelling and customary accessory structures may be erected on any lot which is only nonconforming with respect to lot area and lot width standards 2 in the rm zones where the nonconformity is only by lot area or lot width in no case shall more than one dwelling unit be permitted on a lot with an area of less than

connected with public acquisitions 1 where a structure is located upon a lot a portion of which is acquired for any public use by condemnation purchase dedication or otherwise by any governmental entity such structure may be maintained upon the remaining portion of said lot and may thereafter be used maintained or repaired without relocating or altering the same to comply with the development standards of this chapter further if such structure is partially located upon the site being acquired for public use it may be relocated upon the same lot or premises without observing the required yard space adjacent to the new lot line created by such acquisition and without reducing the number of dwelling units to conform to the development standards of the district in which it is located if only a portion of an existing structure is acquired for public use the repair remodeling or reconstruction of the remainder of such structure which was made necessary by such acquisition shall conform to the provisions of the building code any portion of the structure which is not required to be repaired remodeled or reconstructed by reason of said acquisition shall not be required to be made to conform to the provisions of the building code unless it would otherwise be required to conform thereto independently of and in the absence of said acquisition of only a portion of the structure 2 if a lot does not comply with the development standards of the district due to an acquisition of a portion thereof for public use or if a legally existing nonconforming lot is reduced in size due to an acquisition of a portion thereof for public use the remainder of said lot not acquired for public use so long as said remainder is not smaller in area or width than onehalf of the minimum area or width required for the zone in which it is situated may be utilized for the purposes in the same manner as though it lawfully exist ed at the time the regulations with which it does not conform became effective  provided that this paragraph shall not affect any structure previously and legally existing on said remainder h structures under construction any structure under construction for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the date of this chapter may be completed and used in accordance with the provisions of this chapter or any amendment thereto provided 1 that construction or proposed use of such structure is not at said operative date in violation of any other ordinance or law  2 that such structure is completed within one year from said operative date  3
