areas of the city of blanchard oklahoma are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 1511 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 2405  15403 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 2405  15404 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this section uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in the times of flood or in case of excessive increase in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  1512 3 control the alteration of natural flood plains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the

velocities when flowing full of not less than two 20 feet per second based on kutters or mannings formula using an n value of  use of other practical n value will be approved for the longer pipe sections if deemed justifiable on the basis of research or field data presented the following are the minimum slopes which should be provided especially where the depth of flow may be small and are desirable minimums in all parts of the system under special conditions if full and justifiable reasons are given slopes slightly less than those required for the two 2 foot per second velocity when full may be permitted such decreased slopes will only be considered where the depth of flow will be 03 of the diameter or greater for design average flow whenever such decreased slopes are selected the engineer must furnish with his report his computations of the depths of flow in such pipes at minimum average and peak rates of flow it is recognized that such flatter grades may cause additional
