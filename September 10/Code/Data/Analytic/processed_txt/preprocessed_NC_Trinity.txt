be officially known as the universal stormwater management program it is referred to herein as this ordinance authority the trinity city council is authorized to adopt this ordinance pursuant to north carolina law including but not limited to article 5 of the constitution of north carolina  city of trinity  north carolina general statutes 1432147 and rules promulgated by the environmental management commission there under  session law 2006246   185 and floodway regulation   planning and regulation of development   findings it is hereby determined that development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this ordinance therefore the trinity city council establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge purpose a general the purpose of this ordinance is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges into municipal stormwater systems it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and post8 development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  and protect water and aquatic resources b specific this ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1 establishing decisionmaking processes for development that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water resources  2 requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding stream bank erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establishing minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establishing design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural stormwater bmps that may be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encouraging the use of better management and site design practices such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establishing provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater bmps to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety  7 establishing administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans for the inspection of approved projects and to assure appropriate longterm maintenance 8 coordinating site design plans that include open space and natural areas with the city of trinity subdivision  open space standards also zoning open space requirements 9 controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate stormwater system 10 assigning responsibility and processes for approving the creation and maintenance of adequate drainage and flood damage prevention

practice or condition in violation of this ordinance shall be subject to the remedies penalties andor enforcement actions in accordance with this article persons subject to the remedies and penalties set forth herein may include any architect engineer builder contractor developer agency or any other person who participates in assists directs creates causes or maintains a condition that results in or constitutes a violation of this ordinance or fails to take appropriate action so that a violation of this ordinance results or persists  or an owner any tenant or occupant or any other person who has control over or responsibility for the use or development of the property on which the violation occurs for the purposes of this article responsible persons shall include but not be limited to 1 person maintaining condition resulting in or constituting violation an architect engineer builder contractor developer agency or any other person who participates in assists directs creates causes or

land the owner of the land on which the violation occurs any tenant or occupant of the property any person who is responsible for stormwater controls or practices pursuant to a private agreement or public document or any person 33 who has control over or responsibility for the use development or redevelopment of the property remedies and penalties the remedies and penalties provided for violations of this ordinance whether civil or criminal shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy provided by law and may be exercised in any order a remedies 1 withholding of certificate of occupancy the stormwater administrator or other authorized agent may refuse to issue a certificate of occupancy for the building or other improvements constructed or being constructed on the site and served by the stormwater practices in question until the applicant or other responsible person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violations described therein 2 disapproval of subsequent permits and development approvals as long as a violation of this ordinance continues and remains uncorrected the stormwater administrator or other authorized agent may withhold and the city of trinity planning and zoning board may disapprove any request for permit or development approval or authorization provided for by this ordinance or the zoning subdivision andor building regulations as appropriate for the land on which the violation occurs 3 injunction abatements etc the stormwater administrator with the written authorization of the city manager may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement to correct a violation of this ordinance any person violating this ordinance shall be subject to the full range of equitable remedies provided in the general statutes or at common law 4 correction as public health nuisance costs as lien etc if the violation is deemed dangerous or prejudicial to the public health or public safety and is within the geographic limits prescribed by north carolina gs  160a193 the stormwater administrator with the written authorization of the city manager may cause the violation to be corrected and the costs to be assessed as a lien against the property 5 stop work order the stormwater administrator may issue a stop work order to the persons violating this ordinance the stop work order shall remain in effect until the person has taken the remedial measures set forth in the notice of violation or has otherwise cured the violation or violations described therein the stop work 34 order may be withdrawn or modified to enable the person to take the necessary remedial measures to cure such violation or violations commentary a stop work order is an important tool where as in the case of stormwater violations the consequences of delay in halting illegal activity can result in significant harm to the environment and public health safety or welfare however the enabling authority for use of a stop work order by local governments is unclear as a practical matter if a legal challenge is brought to a local governments use of a stop work order it is unlikely to result in negative consequences for the local government since the legal remedy would likely consist of the courts invalidation of the stop work order if a local government chooses to include this stop work provision it should do so in consultation with legal counsel and an accelerated appeal process pursuant to article 205 appeals should be provided for situations where a stop work order is applied one way to accelerate the appeal process is to shorten the timeframe for review of appeals a special or emergency board of adjustment meeting could be called so that a party seeking to challenge a stop work order would achieve a speedy resolution of the matter b civil penalties violation of this ordinance may subject the violator to a civil penalty to be recovered in a civil action in the nature of a debt if the violator does not pay the penalty within 30 days after notice of the violation is issued by the stormwater

of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision d a sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification protection or directing persons

are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above f these regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the
