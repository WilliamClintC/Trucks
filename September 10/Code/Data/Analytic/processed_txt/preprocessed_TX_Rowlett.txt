chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments for example if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 61 and 62 is desired to be added such new section would be numbered 615 new articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or in the case of articles may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the case of divisions may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject the next successive number shall be assigned to the new article

position of the section within the chapter thus the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 12 and the first section of chapter 6 is 61 under this system each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments for example if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 61 and 62 is desired to be added such new section would be numbered 615 new articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or in the case of articles may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the case of divisions may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject the next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division new chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters page numbering system the page numbering system used in volumes i and ii is a prefix system the letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume the number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion in the case of a chapter of the ordinances the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter in

the rational method which is based on the principle that a maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge the formula for calculation of runoff by the rational method is table 522 calculation of runoff by rational method q   cia where q   the maximum rate of discharge expressed in cubic feet per second c   a runoff coefficient which varies with the topography soil soil cover land use and moisture content of the soil at the time the runoff producing rainfall occurs this runoff coefficient shall be based on the ultimate use of the land as recommended by the land use plan for the city and shall be selected from table 1 of this chapter on the basis of the use shown on land use and zoning map of the comprehensive zoning ordinance for the city if an area has had a change of zoning to give the area land use for which the c in table i is higher than use shown on land use and zoning maps the higher c factor shall be used i   rainfall intensity in inches per hour from the applicable curves of figure 1 time of concentration or duration of rainfall for use in

that the rate of runoff created by the development of their property does not exceed the rate of runoff resulting from that which presently exists the runoff rate which will exit the project shall not be greater than that volume or velocity determined defined design criteria as outlined in this chapter when development can or does provide direct drainage outlet works into lake ray hubbard consideration will be given to allow the design of storm runoff without detention or retention within the project limits 3 the two basic methods suggested for predicting the volume of runoff with time and the peak flow rate are the rational method and the unit hydrograph method the rational method may be used for drainage areas less than or equal to 200 acres drainage basins that exceed 200 acres must use the unit hydrograph method the soil conservation service technical release no 55 is an acceptable unit hydrograph method when the rational method is used and detention is required the volume of water supplied by the design storm may be calculated by converting the runoff rate during a specific duration to volume the inflow volume should be determined for a period of at least twice the time concentration for the site retention and detention are two generalized types of storm runoff storage used to control the rate of runoff all detention ponds should be designed to empty within a

authorization findings of fact purpose and methods the legislature of the state of texas has in the flood control insurance act texas water delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council of rowlett texas does ordain as follows  922008 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of rowlett are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  922008 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  922008 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards

master thoroughfare plan mtp is a component of the rowlett comprehensive plan cp the future land use plan map flup recommendations in the cp must have land uses so situated that the ability to move people goods and services safely and efficiently can be achieved or else the functions of the flup will be severely limited therefore this mtp has to be a component of the cp because of the inseparability between land use and the transportation system this rowlett mtp establishes a vital link between land use and transportation facilities and services needed to support growth while it can be argued that the transportation system is global for purposes of this mtp the broadest context is the north central texas council of governments mobility 2025 plan this plan serves the cog region and is cogs latest longrange metropolitan transportation plan within the mobility plan area is the draft combined rowlettsachsemurphywylie thoroughfare plan which was prepared by cog with technical assistance by the staffs of these four municipalities the data in this proposed fourcity plan serves as the subregional context for this rowlett mtp previous mtp studies previous mtp and related studies that further aid in placing this rowlett mtp in context are the following  tricity thoroughfare plan rowlett c when adopted this rowlett mtp will repeal this ordinance  city of rowlett

feasible rowlett staff and officials use the rockwall county plan goals objectives and policies introduction a fundamental purpose of the rowlett mtp is to coordinate the movement of people goods and services within the city the goals objectives and policies in the plan are produced to serve the public interest individual proposals for transportation services may at times be in conflict with the literal application of these guidelines therefore all goals may not be met in all instances and their application by the city planning and zoning commission and city council will reflect a weighing of the issues involved in resolving the conflicts that naturally arise in individual circumstances the goals objectives and policies g o & p of the mtp are designed to create a safe and efficient transportation system for all persons who live work or visit within the city in addition to providing the planning basis and overall direction for transportation functions in rowlett the go & p can

objective that can complement objective 307 above is the following  objective 312  the city will actively pursue cmao stp enhancements or other grant funds to implement its nonmotorized program the regional perspective introduction transportation planning and functions extend beyond the borders of municipalities therefore this mtp will discuss the regional planning perspective regarding transportation planning so that the local rowlett mtp perspective can be placed in context the draft combined rowlettsachsemurphywylie thoroughfare plan the following information in this section 3 represents a synopsis of the draft combined rowlettsachsemurphywylie thoroughfare plan this information was prepared by nctcog on  to aid the rowlett city council and the planning and zoning commission during their joint work session held in november 2000 to address this fourcity thoroughfare plan mtp this joint work session served to refine the fourcity draft mtp which led to the specific rowlett mtp recommendations described in section 4 of this document the cog staff has indicated that it intends to finalize this fourcity mtp after the proposed president george bush turnpike pgbt formerly known as sh 190 alignment is finalized that updated cog plan will also include modeling of the finalized pgbt alignment in addition to modeling the rowlett mtp recommendations as described in section 5 of this rowlett mtp and as adopted by the rowlett city council the purpose therefore is to ultimately have a fourcity mtp integrated with the rowlett mtp as per the specific recommendations in section 4 of this document this cog synopsis is comprised of 21 pages however rowlett staff removed pages 15 and 18 which describe roadway classifications and cross sections that are currently not compatible with rowlett designations rowlett and cog staff intend to make these designations compatible as part of future mtp updates thoroughfare plan draft thoroughfare planning

thoroughfare plan staging schedule 2015  2025 the local perspective introduction the essence of the rowlett mtp is reflected in this section regarding the local perspective which focuses mainly on the transportation modes that service the city of rowlett however as stated earlier the local perspective takes on greater meaning as understood within the regional perspective previously discussed the data described in the regional perspectives section therefore serves as the broader context by which to place the rowlett local perspective further this section 5 represents a refinement of the draft combined rowlettsachsemurphywylie thoroughfare plan this refinement has been prepared by the rowlett planning and zoning commission city council and staff also this refinement represents the more detailed and precise rowlett mtp needs based on the understanding of rowlett officials and staff a multimodal system this rowlett mtp is a multimodal plan the term multimodal means that a community uses a variety of systems to transport people goods and services and for a variety of reasons therefore rowlett has the following transportation modes that can serve the city  dfw love field and local airports these airport facilities serve rowlett residents and businesses for international national and regional aircraft services  amtrak this national commuter railroad system can serve rowlett residents locations within the dallas area there could be direct connection to amtrak via future dart lightrail linkage  m k & t railroad this railroad provides the city and the region with freighthauling services  dallas area rapid transit dart this commuter lightrail system will serve rowlett citizens and will provide lightrail linkages to other municipalities and areas in the dallas area it will aid in enhancing rowletts and the regions economic development as well as the quality of life  bus system the bus system is a function of the dart lightrail program and therefore serves to integrate these two systems also the school districts provide school buses to accommodate students attending school in the rowlett area  the road thoroughfare system  this rowlett mtp mainly addresses the road thoroughfare system serving rowlett and its region  hike and bike trail system this movement system will add to the citizens quality of life and can also be perceived as a component of and linkage to the rowlett park recreation and openspace system as such it will also add to rowletts already excellent quality of life  lake ray hubbard the use of watercraft on lake ray hubbard represents a quality of life factor in rowlett and is also part of the citys recreational system  pedestrianoriented conceptual downtown plan city staff has begun preliminary evaluations toward the purpose of developing a downtown plan that will have among its features pedestrianoriented elements that will enhance the human scale and walkability within the rowlett downtown district also within this downtown plan area dart facilities will be located thereby making this lightrail system part of the downtown function  the collector system for the technological research tr zoning district see the rowlett master thoroughfare plan map in this section the rowlett mtp graphics this section contains four graphics that illustrate the proposed rowlett mtp these are  the rowlett master thoroughfare plan  thoroughfares that currently function as collectors in rowlett  rowlett hikebike trail system  combined rowlett thoroughfare plan which depicts thoroughfares that function as collectors and the rowlett mtp all existing and proposed physical developments must be evaluated against these graphic representations on a consistent basis or else it will be difficult for rowlett to develop an incremental efficient and consistent transportation system appropriate coordination with other agencies and funding are also major plan implementation techniques see also section 5 proposed president george bush turnpike  unfixed alignment the proposed eastern extension of the president george bush turnpike formerly known as sh 190 as depicted on the rowlett mtp represents a consistent commitment to this proposed location of the corridor and unspecified alignment as determined and supported by rowlett city officials since 1994 this roadway project is now being considered as a tollway rather than a freeway at the request of local governments because of limited federal and state transportation funding available in the dallasfort worth region consideration of this project as a tollway will help finance the project faster and reduce implementation time see the enclosed map that indicates two alignment alternatives for the proposed president george bush turnpike  unfixed alignment dated february 2001 this commitment is further reinforced state highway 190 land use corridor study city of rowlett texas rowlett resolution no 22195c  the rowlett comprehensive plan adopted  and the rowlett zoning ordinance adopted  the proposed collector system for the technology research tr zoning district the rowlett mtp map indicates the tr zoning district and a proposed collector system to serve thoroughfare functions within and adjacent to this tr district the benefits of illustrating this collector thoroughfare are the following  the first developer within the district will not dictate the location and configuration of the collector system thereby potentially disrupting the overall efficient design functioning and lotting arrangement within the district  the overall land area within the district will be able to more efficiently function with a collector designed for the purpose of effectively serving all the potential lots and developments within the district  the planning and construction of safer and more efficient access to the president george bush turnpike formerly known as sh 190 can be increased by relating the tr collector location and configuration in conjunction with the ultimate president george bush turnpike formerly known as sh 190 alignment frontage road system and access points  more efficient marketing and design of the tr district can occur as a result of a collector system better correlated with land use planning and development kirbyliberty grove road kirbyliberty grove road shall be planned as a sixlane divided thoroughfare however should president george bush turnpike be constructed such that any portion of kirbyliberty grove road is an access road for the turnpike those portions shall be constructed with only four lanes of traffic master thoroughfare plan map b exhibit a 852003  exh a 1172006  exh a 7242012   5202014  exh a 4212015 exh a 4212015 exh a 4212015 master thoroughfares that currently function as collectors in rowlett hikebike trail system combined master thoroughfare plan b exhibit b 852003 proposed eastern extension implementation introduction as is true of all plans in order to be effective they must be implemented the following implementation techniques will serve to implement this rowlett mtp  although this could be a transportation goal an implementation tool would be to identify and prioritize transportation system needs to meet current and future travel demands based on the rowlett comprehensive plan such prioritization can include financial payment opportunities in conjunction with the staging and development of future utility systems within rowlett implementation techniques  coordination with the completed combined rowlettsachsemurphywylie thoroughfare plan and the rockwall county thoroughfare plan adopted this coordination will provide regional integration to aid in continued safe and efficient transportation functioning  coordination with the rowlett comprehensive plan rowlett zoning ordinance rowlett subdivision regulations and other applicable city plans codes and ordinances this mtp is actually a major component of the rowlett comprehensive plan cp therefore recommendations in the cp must be coordinated with the recommendations in this mtp to aid in achieving compatibility with land use and transportation requirements similarly the mtp recommendations must be coordinated with the requirements in the rowlett zoning ordinance subdivision regulations and other applicable city plans codes and ordinances  coordination with rowlett development reviews the goals objectives and policies in conjunction with the mtp maps in section 4 that depict the recommended rowlett transportation system must be consulted and enforced as part of the development review process for zoning platting and site plan evaluations it is at this level that the rowlett longrange transportationplanning program must be initiated not to do so could cost lost opportunities that could jeopardize the integrity of the rowlett mtp system  capital improvement program cip the cip serves to prioritize needs and funding related to major programs serving the city the cip related to traffic roads and transportation will aid in addressing these needs on a priority basis thereby hopefully adequately providing funds in a timely manner to keep maintenance of road systems at a safe and efficient level etc and to otherwise support the ongoing establishment of the overall rowlett transportation system conclusion this rowlett mtp in conjunction with the rowlett comprehensive plan is a major growthmanagement and traffic management tool through the thoughtful planning and implementation of rowletts multimodal transportation system rowletts already excellent quality of life will be maintained and enhanced for existing and future generations of rowlett residents and businesses the major thoroughfares and collectors reflected in the plan as well as the hikebike trail system are fundamental adjuncts to the ongoing and thoughtful land use planning that has occurred for decades in this city comprehensive planning programs the rapid growth of rowlett over the past decades in conjunction with the rapid growth of the surrounding dallas region is a major call for ongoing and thoughtful land use and transportation planning in the city as stated in section 5 implementation of this  and other rowlett plans  must be a consistent commitment by staff and city officials finally citizens staff and officials must continuously keep the vision of a city with a high quality of life
