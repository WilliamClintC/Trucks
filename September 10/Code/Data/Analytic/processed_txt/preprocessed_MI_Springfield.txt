density shall not exceed 171 rooms per acre  2 the number of dwelling units permitted per acre shall be determined by the following schedule a all singlefamily detached dwellings and attached cluster dwellings shall count as six rooms  b all fourbedroom units in multiplefamily structures shall count as five rooms  c all threebedroom units in multiplefamily structures shall count as four rooms  d all twobedroom units in multiplefamily structures shall count as three rooms  e all onebedroom units in multiplefamily structures shall count as two rooms  f all efficiency units in multiplefamily structures shall count as one room  3 for the purpose of determining the number of bedrooms in units in multiplefamily structures all plans showing onebedroom twobedroom or threebedroom units and including a den library or other extra room shall count such extra room as a bedroom for the purpose of computing density  4 no more than 50 percent of the total rooms permitted on the site shall be in multiplefamily dwelling units  5 no more than five percent of the total rooms permitted on the site as multiplefamily dwelling units shall be efficiency type apartments  6 public open space such as park sites and public and private road rightsofway except for major thoroughfare may be included in computing the area of the parcel and therefore the related density nonresidential use areas and those areas proposed for the development of churches and related activities shall be excluded in computing the area of the parcel and therefore the related density a maximum of 50 percent of the horizontal surface of all natural or manmade bodies of water located entirely within the planned residential development project shall be permitted to be computed as a portion of the required 15 percent private common open space the horizontal surface of all bodies of water shall be excluded from the computation of density b in order to protect abutting land on the periphery of the planned residential development the following rules shall control 1 where the adjacent land is zoned r1 r2 or r3 the planned residential development shall provide for singlefamily development to a depth of not less than 330 feet along such boundary so as to make this area conform to the abutting onefamily area  provided that this 330foot depth may be penetrated by an elementary school site park golf course or other related open space which is recorded in perpetuity for such purpose the only building permitted in this 330 feet shall be a onefamily residence  2 the requirement of subsection b1 of this section may be waived by the planning commission where the abutting land is not platted and if the planning commission determines that there is a reasonable basis for believing that the adjacent land may be developed in other than singlefamily usage because the master plan indicates other than singlefamily and the conditions of the land at such boundary indicate that multiplefamily development would preserve the natural terrain and vegetation to a greater extent than singlefamily along this common boundary c common open space shall be provided on the basis of at least 15 percent

plat  1601  app a  1601 subdivision open space plan a the intent of the subdivision open space plan is to promote the following objectives 1 provide a more desirable living environment by preserving the natural character of open fields stands of trees brooks hills and similar natural assets  2 encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of residential areas  3 encourage a more efficient aesthetic and desirable use of open area while recognizing a reduction in development costs and allowing the developer to bypass natural obstacles on the site  4 encourage the provision of open space within reasonable distance to all lot development of the subdivision and to further encourage the development of recreational facilities b modification to the standards outlined in this division may be made in the r1 and r2 onefamily residential districts when the following conditions are met 1 the lot area in all onefamily residential districts which are served by a public sanitary sewer system may be reduced up to 20 percent in the r1 district this reduction may be accomplished in part by reducing lot widths up to ten feet in the r2 district this reduction may be accomplished in part by reducing lot widths up to five feet these lot area reductions shall be permitted provided that the dwelling unit density shall be no greater than if the land area to be subdivided were developed in the minimum square foot lot areas as required for each onefamily district under this division all calculations shall be predicated upon the onefamily districts having the following gross densities including roads r1   33 dwelling units per acre  r2   44 dwelling units per acre 2 rear yards may be reduced to 30 feet when such lots border on land dedicated for park

void all previous approval  8 under this subdivision open space approach the proprietor shall dedicate sufficient park area so that each final plat is within maximum density requirements  provided however that any entire park within a single block shall be dedicated as a whole  1602  app a  1602 onefamily clustering option the intent of this section is to permit the development of onefamily residential patterns which innovation will introduce flexibility so as to provide for the sound physical handling of site plans in situations where the normal subdivision approach would otherwise be restrictive to accomplish this development the following modifications to the onefamily residential standards as outlined in this division shall be permitted subject to the conditions imposed in this section 1 in all onefamily residential districts onefamily clustering shall be permitted in those parcels having at least one of the following characteristics a in all onefamily residential districts onefamily clustering shall be permitted in an area generally parallel to and not to exceed 360 feet in depth on those unsubdivided parcels of land having frontage on a major thoroughfare of at least 120 feet and being so located as to provide transition plan flexibility between such major thoroughfare and adjacent onefamily development 1 the planning commission may vary this 360 feet of depth wherein it shall find that the parcel is of a narrow dimension and would not permit sound development of that portion remaining after the 360 feet of depth were subtracted from the total depth 2 the planning commission may vary the 360 feet of depth when the development of the remaining portion of the parcel in question would due to topography or existing abutting development more properly be related to the development on the 360 feet of depth b an unsubdivided parcel which would make sound physical development under the normal subdivision approach impractical due to shape andor dimension c an unsubdivided parcel which contains a floodplain or poor soil conditions which results in a substantial portion of the total area of the parcel being unbuildable soil test borings floodplain maps or documented evidence must be submitted to the planning commission in order to substantiate the parcels qualification for cluster development d those parcels of land containing major topographic problems which in the opinion of the planning commission would make sound physical development under the normal subdivision approach impractical e an unsubdivided area which the planning commission finds to be characterized by major stands of trees streams or other watercourses which as significant natural assets ought to be preserved such conditions making sound development of the site under normal subdivision approaches undesirable requests for qualification under these conditions must be supported by documented evidence which indicates that the natural assets would qualify the parcel under this option 2 under this section attached onefamily homes shall be permitted when such homes are attached common party wall which does not have over 50 percent of its area in common with an abutting dwelling wall  by means of an architectural wall detail which does not form interior room space  or common party wall in only the garage portion of adjacent structures there being no common party wall relationship permitted other portion of the residential unit the maximum number of units attached in the manner described shall not exceed four in a cluster 3 the maximum density permitted under this section including roads shall be as follows r1   33 dwelling units per acre r2   44 dwelling units per acre r3   65 dwelling units per acre 4 the minimum floor area for all units constructed on any portion of the site under this option shall be at least equal to the minimum floor area required for the onefamily residential district in which the cluster is to be constructed 5 yard requirements shall be provided as follows a spacing between any grouping of four clustered onefamily units or less and another grouping of such structures shall be equal to at least 30 feet measured between the nearest points of the two groupings  b all such clusters shall be so situated as to have one side of the grouping abutting onto a common open space  c that side of a cluster adjacent to a private service drive or private lane shall not be nearer to such drive or lane than 20 feet with the garage portion of the structure and not nearer than 25 feet with the living portion of the structure  d that side of cluster adjacent to a dedicated street shall not be nearer to such street than 30 feet except that on lands immediately adjacent to an interior dedicated street which is part of the comprehensive site plan submitted under this section and having slopes in excess of 15 percent  for each one percent over 15 percent the front yard may be reduced by five feet and in no instance shall a structure be closer to the road rightofway line than ten feet  e this nature of cluster when abutting a front yard of an existing recorded subdivision which is not a part of the
