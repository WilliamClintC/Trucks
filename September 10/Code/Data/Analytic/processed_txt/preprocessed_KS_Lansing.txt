on  1 the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12741 et seq and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the governing body of lansing kansas does ordain as follows a the special flood hazard areas of the city of lansing kansas are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated flood plain causing increases in flood heights and velocities 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this ordinance uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps i selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations fis ii calculation of water surface profiles that are based upon a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood iii computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point iv delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height v delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood purpose  objectives a it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize public and private losses described in   to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d and kar 5444 by

2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction 3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard 4 control the alteration of natural flood plains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters 5 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage 6 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands b the objectives of this article are to 1 protect human life and health 2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects 3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4 minimize prolonged business interruptions 5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in flood plains 6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas and 7 insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this

shape signs mounted on or displayed as an irregular shape shall be measured by the smallest area of up to two standard geometrical shapes that can encompass the entire sign mounting figure 16 general area calculations typical method for measuring typical sign shapes  irregular signs are measured within the smallest area of up to two geometric shape that contains the entire sign 1 general provisions land development code 6 city of lansing b detached signs the area of the sign shall be computed by the entire area of the face of the structure cabinet or module enclosed by the border of the frame c wall window or other buildingmounted signs any building mounted sign mounted on a background shall be measured by the area of the background if mounted directly on the wall the area shall be computed by means of the smallest single and continuous perimeter of up to two standard geometric shapes that enclose the outer limits of the writing emblem or other display gaps in writing emblems or other display which are greater than two times the height of the sign area when using the same single continuous perimeter above may be subtracted from the calculation of the sign area but shall be interpreted as two signs the area of the wall or window area for the purposes of determining an allowed percentage shall be the total surface of the wall or window visible in an elevation view d decorative elements embellishments such as pole covers framing decorative roofing and support structures shall not be included in the area of the measurement if they contain no writing emblem or other display e doublefaced signs where the sign faces of a doublefaced sign are no more than three feet apart at any location only one face will be measured in computing sign area if the two faces of a doublefaced sign are of unequal area the area of the sign will be the area of the larger face in all other cases the areas of all faces of a multifaced sign or the surface area of objects will be added together to compute the area of the sign f height sign height is measured from the existing lowest grade directly below the sign to the highest point on the sign or sign structure g clearance sign clearance is measured from the highest point of the ground directly below the sign to the lowest point on the sign structure enclosing the sign face c computation of time the following rules
