variance would not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances cvariances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 4flood insurance notice the zoning administrator must notify the applicant for a variance that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance actions 5general considerations the community may consider the following factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses in floodplains
