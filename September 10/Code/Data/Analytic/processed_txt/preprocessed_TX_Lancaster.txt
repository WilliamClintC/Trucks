should consider the natural topography and soil conditions in an attempt to limit the erosion potential 15 install temporary filtration measures at storm drain inlets c effect of approval of plan 1 it is to be understood that the approval of an erosion and sedimentation control plan by the department of public works does not constitute recognition by the city that the erosion and sedimentation control plan will prevent any or all public erosion nuisances by approval of the erosion and sedimentation control plan the city does not warrant that the measures required by the plan will be sufficient to prevent future public erosion nuisance and the city waives no rights to pursue any legal remedies both under this article and all other applicable ordinances and laws 2 if for any reason after an erosion and sedimentation control plan is approved by the department of public works a public erosion nuisance occurs on property addressed by said plan the approval of said plan shall not be a defense or bar to prosecution under this article d construction or building activity on single lot or tract any construction or building activity occurring on single lots or tracts including home

devices 3 where property adjacent to public land slopes toward said public lands on a steeper grade than  horizontalvertical permanent slope stabilization measures shall be taken such as retaining walls rock or concrete riprap etc the approval of construction plans or a building permit does not constitute a recognition by the city that any or all erosion nuisances will be prevented failure to address erosion control on any construction plans or building permit does not relieve the applicant of responsibility to comply with the requirements of this article additionally approval of plans or a permit by the city shall not be a defense to or bar to prosecution under this article e disclaimer of liability the planning considerations given in this article for erosion controls rely on a degree of erosion and sedimentation control and flood protection that is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and that is based on scientific engineering and economic considerations this article does not imply    374618 that erosion and sedimentation controls will survive inundation by runoff from storms or that land below such controls will be absolutely free from flooding or flood damages this article shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages or erosion or sedimentation damages whether to persons or property that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder this article is not sought to be a substitute to other federal state and local laws and regulations concerning drainage and flood control f stop work orders all development improvement and construction on any land which is in violation of the provisions of this article may be halted and stopped by

and sedimentation nuisance or violation will generally consist of two problems i a failure on private property to stabilize soils against erosion  and ii subsequent sedimentation onto public property causing unsightly or bothersome situations the city shall have the right as set forth in this section to remedy either or both problems and require the responsible party to pay the cost incurred 1 when deemed necessary by the director of public works and upon expiration of the notice period required in section b if action has not begun by the party responsible for the violation the city may take action to remove or clean up bothersome sedimentation on public property the cost incurred will be billed to the responsible party and payment due within thirty 30 days of the mailing of such statement this action by the city is in addition to the fines that may be levied for such violation it should also be understood that the condition of the private property that failed to prevent the erosion might still constitute a violation of this article 2 in the event that the party responsible for a violation shall fail to make hisher private property or property within their control comply with this article or begin action to cause compliance within the notice period provided for herein the director of public works or hisher designee may take action for abatement on said private

legislature of the state has in the flood control insurance act texas water section  delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council of the city does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 152019   377618 unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this article

noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards    534618 6 in the event an act of god war strike riot or other catastrophe has been established the user shall control production of all discharges to the extent possible until such time as the reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided b bypass 1 for the purposes of this section a bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections 3 and 4 of this section 3 a if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the superintendent andor control authority at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible b a user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times

waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours 4 a bypass is prohibited and the superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and iii the user submitted notices as required

adopted  article 2408 stormwater management provisions a statutory authorization the legislature of the state has delegated the responsibility to local governments to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses and manage the floodplains in areas under their jurisdiction b findings of fact 1 the drainageways creeks and flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in the loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses could be created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that increase flood heights and velocities and by placing structures and other improvements vulnerable to floods in flood hazard areas 3 the development of land causes large quantities of soil to be displaced and transported to downstream locations this soil displacement can create significant soil erosion and sedimentation problems although erosion is a natural process excessive levels of erosion may result in potentially destructive consequences a buildup of sediment degrades water quality destroys valuable environmental resources and obstructs watercourses and storm drains which can cause flooding thereby damaging public and private lands and property these problems result in a serious threat to the health safety and general welfare of the city streams and floodplain areas in the city are valuable resources to the citizens in that they provide recreational opportunities improve the aesthetics of the community convey stormwater runoff and filter out water quality pollutants c statement of purpose stormwater management policies shall govern the planning design construction operation and maintenance of storm drainage and erosion control facilities within the city this article sets forth the minimum requirements necessary to provide and maintain a safe efficient and effective drainage system within the city and to establish the various public and private responsibilities for the provision thereof further the purpose of this article is the following 1 protect human life health and property 2 minimize the expenditure of public money for building and maintaining flood control and storm drainage projects and cleaning sediment out of storm drains streets sidewalks and watercourses 3 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric service telephone and sewer lines streets bridges and drainageways due to stormwater runoff and erosion 4 help maintain a stable tax base and preserve land values 5 provide assistance upon request to potential buyers if property is in an area of special flood hazard    539618 6 manage stormwater runoff and the sediment load in that runoff from points and surfaces within new and existing developments 7 establish a reasonable standard of design for development which prevents potential flood and erosion damage 8 reduce the pollutant loading to streams ponds and other watercourses 9 minimize prolonged interruption of business and the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding 10 preserve the natural beauty and aesthetics of the community 11 obligate those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard to assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood loss in order to accomplish its purposes this section uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters 4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands e scope of authority except as exempted by section  any person firm utility corporation or business proposing to develop land or

of the development calculations and limitations    561618 a general 1 the selection of an appropriate method for calculating runoff depends upon the size of the drainage area contributing runoff at a most downstream point of a project the rational method is acceptable for situations in which the drainage area is generally less than 160 acres a unit hydrograph method is required for situations with larger drainage areas these methods are described in the stormwater design manual 2 runoff computations shall be based upon fully developed watershed conditions in accordance with the citys latest land use projections b drainage improvements required for development 1 all developments shall provide for any new drainage systems the improvement of any existing drainage systems channel

proposed development and if offsite improvements are required as a result of the proposed development the developer shall be responsible for constructing the needed improvements 4 if no stormwater master plan for a given watershed addressing downstream drainage systems has been prepared or the factors upon which a previous stormwater master plan was based have been substantially changed as determined by the public works director the developer shall at the developers sole cost and expense have a downstream analysis prepared in accordance with the stormwater design manual criteria by a

current zoning or proposed zoning  d the existing 100year flows in excess of the existing systems capacities within the watershed if any  e the various facilities and total cost of construction to provide downstream drainage systems with adequate capacities for the 100year full development flows within the watershed  and f the proportionate share of increased runoff attributable to the development of each undeveloped tract within the watershed this will be based upon the incremental increase in    562618 stormwater runoff from each undeveloped tract at full development compared to the total increase from full development in the entire watershed above the existing 100year flows 5 portions of the watershed which lie outside the city limits shall be analyzed and accommodated as if fully developed 6 financing of onsite and offsite drainage facilities shall be in accordance with section  funding of improvements of this article c limitation of runoff calculations to verify

principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge the rational method formula and design parameters for utilizing the formula for runoff calculation are contained in the stormwater design manual e procedure for drainage areas greater than 160 acres 1 for drainage areas in excess of 160 acres where the use of the rational method does not provide reliable results a unit hydrograph method shall be used the use of a unit hydrograph calculation shall be

one acre up to 2 acres c since the site is typically small and surrounded by residential type land uses this zoning would have the appearance of a spot zone it is not an illegal spot zone however if it is called for in the comprehensive plan or if it serves a need in the neighborhood a similar neighborhood convenience center within 14 mile of a proposed center would be an indication that the need for such a center is already being met d while the uses allowed in this district are intended to be located within or adjacent to residential areas care must be taken to insure that adjacent residential uses are protected uses with excessive amounts of traffic noise or litter are not intended for this district areas where two or more corners of an intersection are intended to have

materials noise vibration smoke pollution fire and explosive hazard glare and any other potentially adverse influences such as the use of hazardous materials b this zone is intended for industrial parks and larger cleaner types of industries the manufacturing uses should be conducted within a totally enclosed building any activities conducted outside should be screened and buffered and no external effects such as excessive noise or odor should extend beyond the property lines the sites for such uses are typically a minimum of two acres and average 5 to 10 acres with a significant amount of land dedicated to landscaping c because this is a limited industrial zone with substantial screening and buffering requirements limited industrial uses are suitable for high visibility locations such as along the freeway or within a reasonable distance of residential areas residential uses should be discouraged from locating near the industrial district to protect the industries from residential complaints d areas should not be zoned to this use unless they are located on or close to an arterial capable of carrying commercial and truck traffic they should be located close to major 1478 truck routes internal streets in such developments should be sized and strengthened to accommodate truck traffic each industry should work with the city to insure the water pressure and capacity is adequate to provide fire protection for that particular industry before such industry is developed industries should also work with the city to insure that the water wastewater and drainage capacity is adequate before the industry is developed 2 permitted uses in general industrial parks and larger cleaner types of industrial uses are allowed 3 special standards no building or

development regulations development  general a purpose the purpose of this to provide for the creation of planned development zoning districts pd districts pd districts are intended to provide for the development of land as an integral unit for single or mixed use in accordance with a pd concept plan that may include uses regulations and other requirements that vary from the citys zoning from other ordinances rules or regulations of the city pd districts are intended to implement the goals and objectives of the citys comprehensive plan but may be accompanied by specific amendments to provisions of the comprehensive plan the parks and open space plan or the thoroughfare plan pd districts are also intended to encourage flexible and creative planning to ensure the compatibility of land uses and to allow for the adjustment of changing demands to meet the current needs of the community by meeting one or more of the following purposes  to provide for a superior design of lots or buildings   to achieve a mixture of uses and or residential unit types   to provide for increased recreation andor open space opportunities for public use   to provide amenities or features that would be of special benefit to the property users or community   to protect or preserve natural amenities and environmental assets such as trees creeks ponds floodplains slopes or hills and view corridors   to protect or preserve existing historical buildings structures features or places  or  to provide an appropriate balance between the intensity of development and the ability to provide adequate supporting public facilities and services b nature of pd districts and minimum standards each pd district is intended to be a freestanding zoning district in which land uses and intensities of land use may be tailored to fit the physical features of the site and to achieve compatibility with existing and planned adjacent uses in order to ensure that a pd district implements the policies of the comprehensive plan and to further ensure that the pd district is in accordance with a comprehensive plan of zoning regulation it is necessary to establish minimum standards for residential and nonresidential uses proposed for the pd district that must be incorporated within an ordinance adopted by the council the pd  1 land use a uses unless otherwise provided by the pd only those uses authorized by the citys zoning permitted in pd districts b location the location of all authorized uses shall be consistent with the pd concept plan and pd site plan 14146 2 open space standards a public and private open space unless otherwise provided by the pd a minimum of twenty percent 20% of the gross land area within the entire pd district shall be devoted to open space consistent with the open space requirements of the citys parks and open space plan at least 80% of all homes should be within 800 feet of a publicly accessible park of at least 15000 sf open space for pd districts may be satisfied by either public or by a combination of public open space and open space held in common unless otherwise provided by development regulations established by the city council open space requirements specified in this subsection are in addition to requirements for site landscaping and buffering public open space shall be dedicated to the city or contain an easement on title as being open to public use b preservation of natural features unless otherwise provided by the pd pd concept plan c floodplain areas shall be preserved and maintained as open space  and d significant stands of native trees and shrubs shall be preserved and protected from destruction or alteration e open space allocation open space requirements shall be satisfied for each phase of a multiphased residential development if open space is not to be provided proportionally among phases of development the applicant must execute a reservation of open space in a form that will assure the city that such open space will be provided the city may require that all open space within the district must be provided prior to completion of development within the district 3 other minimum development standards dimensional and area standards unless otherwise provided by the pd dimensional and area standards for uses shall be the most restrictive standards authorized by the citys zoning the same or similar uses c pd plans required there are three types of plans that may be required as part of the development process within a pd district each successive plan may modify the previous plan provided that it does not substantially change the general intent of the original pd district each successive plan becomes part of the zoning the property and replaces the previously approved plan 1 pd concept plan the pd concept plan is mandatory and is intended to be used as the first step in the pd development process it establishes the most general guidelines for the pd district by identifying the land uses and intensities thoroughfare locations and open space boundaries including public trail systems it may include images of intended style and type of development the concept plan illustrates the integration of these elements into a master plan for the whole pd district the pd concept plan establishes the development standards for the pd district 2 pd development plan a pd development plan is optional and is intended to be used where appropriate as the second step of the pd development process it may be required by the pd ordinance or it may be submitted voluntarily by the property owner a pd development plan constitutes an amendment to the approved pd concept plan and pd may be used where the developer requests or the council requires certain standards for the pd district to be specified after initial establishment of the pd district a 14147 pd development plan includes more detailed information as to the specific development standards and land uses including their boundaries the purposes of a pd development plan are to allow flexibility in the development process by deferring specification of all development standards at the time of pd district creation and to enable developers to satisfy conditions imposed on creation of the district prior to submittal of a pd site plan 3 pd site plan a pd site plan is mandatory and is the final step of the pd development process the purposes of a pd site plan are to assure that the development of individual building lots parcels or tracts within the pd district are consistent with the approved concept plan and development plan if any and to assure that the standards applicable within the pd district are met for each such lot parcel or tract a pd site plan shall continue to be valid for a period of two years after it is

surface elevation either upstream or downstream due to a 5year 10year 50year or 100year storm if the discharge from the area proposed for development would increase the water surface elevation above predevelopment conditions on any property owned by third parties due to any of such storms then such peak discharge must be regulated to the extent necessary to eliminate the increased water surface elevation the regulation of discharges to eliminate such increases may be achieved using either onsite or offsite storm water management facilities such as detention areas retention areas and infiltration and sedimentation ponds b content the preliminary drainage study shall 1 contain a topographical map of the area proposed for development to a scale not smaller than 1 inch   200 feet  2

governments to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses and manage the floodplains in areas under their jurisdiction therefore the city council of the city of lancaster texas does ordain this findings of fact the drainage ways creeks and flood hazard areas of the city of lancaster texas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in the loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses could be created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that increase flood heights and velocities and by placing structures and other improvements vulnerable to floods in flood hazard areas the development of land causes large quantities of soil to be displaced and transported to downstream locations this soil displacement can create significant soil erosion and sedimentation problems although erosion is a natural process excessive levels of erosion may result in potentially destructive consequences a buildup of sediment degrades water quality destroys valuable environmental resources and obstructs watercourses and storm drains which can cause flooding thereby damaging public and private lands and property these problems result in a serious threat to the health safety and general welfare of the city of lancaster streams and floodplain areas in the city of lancaster are valuable resources to the citizens of lancaster in that they provide recreational opportunities improve the aesthetics of the community convey storm water runoff and filter out water quality pollutants c statement of purpose storm water management policies

within the watershed at full development based on current zoning or proposed zoning 4 the existing 100year flows in excess of the existing systems capacities within the watershed if any 5 the various facilities and total cost of construction to provide downstream drainage systems with adequate capacities for the 100year full development flows within the watershed and city of lancaster storm water management  the proportionate share of increased runoff attributable to the development of each undeveloped tract within the watershed this will be based upon the incremental increase in storm water runoff from each undeveloped tract at full development compared to the total increase from full development in the entire watershed above the existing 100year flows portions of the watershed which lie outside the city limits of lancaster shall be analyzed and accommodated as if fully developed financing of onsite and offsite drainage facilities shall be in accordance with funding of improvements of this limitation of runoff calculations to verify downstream adequacy shall be performed to the nearest major receiving stream or downstream to the point where the developed property is no more than

the maximum developed for the site in the drainage analysis 2 if the downstream analysis demonstrates there is not adequate capacity for fully developed watershed condition the developer shall be required to either a limit discharge to predevelopment conditions or less or b improve downstream structures to handle the entire fully developed watershed conditions and proceed with site discharge equivalent to the maximum developed for the site in the drainage analysis d procedure for drainage areas less than 160 acres computation of storm water runoff for drainage areas less than 160 acres shall be by the rational method which is based on the principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge the rational method formula and design parameters for utilizing the formula for runoff calculation are contained in the storm water design manual e procedure for drainage areas greater than 160 acres for drainage areas in excess of 160 acres where the use of the rational method does not provide reliable results a unit hydrograph method shall be
