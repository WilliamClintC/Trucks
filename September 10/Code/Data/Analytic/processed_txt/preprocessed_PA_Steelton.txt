parental control increases the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases and there is a need for the nocturnal curfew for the minors which will achieve under local conditions the purposes hereinbefore stated a for the purposes of the curfew the following terms phrases words and their derivations shall have the meanings given herein borough  the borough of steelton dauphin county

ending  am and beginning totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home to implement that thought with additional precision and precaution numerous exceptions are expressly defined in  515 so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presencetype curfew ordinance more and more exceptions become available with increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended by use of the meaningful phrase be or remain found constitutional in baker v borough of steelton 17 dauph 17 1912 a decision properly classified in thistlewood v trial magistrate for ocean city 204 a2d 688 691 md 1964 as relating to a curfew ordinance of the remaining type street  a way or place of whatsoever nature open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel the term street includes the legal rightofway including but not limited to the cartway of traffic lanes the curb the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved and any grassplots or other grounds found

in the borough administrative offices and police station year of age  continues from one birthday such as the 17th to but not including the day of the next such as the 18th birthday making it clear that 17 or fewer years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase under 18 years of age the latter phrase in practice unfortunately having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that eighteenyearolds might be involved similarly for example 15 or fewer years of age means under 16 years of age b when not inconsistent with the context words used in the present tense include the future words in the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include the plural the word shall is always mandatory and not merely directory a at  pm for minors

curfew a when accompanied by a parent of such minor b when accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said parents place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area c when exercising first amendment rights protected by the united states constitution such as the free exercise of religion freedom of speech and the right of assembly such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by first delivering to communications center personnel at the borough municipal building at 123 north front street where and by whom highpriority messages to the chief of police are regularly received a written communication signed by such minor and countersigned if practicable by a parent of such minor with their home address and telephone number addressed to the chief of police of the borough specifying when where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night during hours when the curfew otherwise applicable to said minor in the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such communication d in case of reasonable necessity but only after such minors parent has communicated to the borough police station personnel the facts establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and destination a copy of such

notice indicating the place and probable time of termination has been given in writing to and duly filed for immediate reference by the chief of police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the police station thus encouraging here as in other exceptional situations conduct on the part of minors involved in such activities and striking a fair balance for any somewhat conflicting interests  515  515  g when authorized by special permit from the chief of police carried on the person of the minor thus authorized as follows when necessary nighttime activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this then recourse may be had to the chief of police of the borough either for a regulation as provided in or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant upon the chief of polices finding of necessity for the use of the streets to the extent warranted by a written application as judicially approved in people v walton 161 p2d 498 502503 cal app 1945 signed by a minor and by a parent of such minor if feasible stating the name age and address of such minor  the name address and telephone number of a parent thereof  the height weight sex color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of such minor  the necessity which requires such minor to remain upon the streets during the curfew hours otherwise applicable  and the street or route and the beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and hour the chief of police may grant a permit in writing for the use by such minor of such streets at such hours as in the chiefs opinion may reasonably be necessary in an emergency this may be handled by telephone or other effective communication with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously either to the chief of police or if unavailable to the police officer authorized by the chief of police to act on his behalf in an emergency at the police station h when authorized by regulation issued by the chief of police in other similar cases of reasonable necessity similarly handled but adapted to necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis normally such regulation by the chief of police permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity media and agencies such as the schools and shall define the activity the scope of the use of the streets permitted the period of time involved not to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary to implement the purposes of this curfew when the minor carries a certified card of employment renewable each calendar month when the current facts so warrant dated or reissued not more than 45 days previously signed by the chief of police and briefly identifying the minor the addresses of his home and of his place of employment and his hours of employment j when the minor is with parental consent in a motor vehicle this contemplates normal travel from excess of caution this clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement borough of steelton this also exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in the borough of steelton k when the minor is 17 years of age if and when the chief of police shall have determined by formal rule first reported to and approved by the  515 curfew  515   516 parental responsibility it shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow such minor to be

expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parents legal custody it is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility objective test it shall afortiori be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor  517 police procedures a policeman of the borough upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of the curfew normally shall take the minor to the borough police station where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor whereupon they shall be interrogated this is intended to permit ascertainment under constitutional safeguards of relevant facts and to centralize responsibility in the officer there and then on duty for accurate effective fair impartial and uniform enforcement and recording thus making available experienced supervisory personnel the best of facilities and access to information and records in the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate a policeman on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in determining age borough council spread upon its minutes and so reported in the press finding the facts as to the extent minimal of juvenile delinquency in such age group permitting such rule currently in the best interests of said minor and of the borough finding that the curfew be relaxed then the chief of police by such formal rule covering a period of time designated therein or until rescission thereof not exceeding one year from the date thereof may take appropriate action excepting designated minors minors in a defined group or area or all minors as the current facts may warrant 17 years of age at the date or attaining 17 years of age during the period that such formal rule is and remains in effect l each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations such as provisions for notification are severable as hereinafter provided but here reemphasized  and additional also severable exceptions broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled respectively in elementary junior high and high schools will be considered by the borough council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student government associations school personnel citizens associations ward precinct and neighborhood spokesmen parents officers and persons in authority concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency  515  517   518

the governing body of the borough finds that a stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and increased runoff flows and velocities which overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increases the cost to the public to manage stormwater b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the borough and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater f federal and state regulations require certain boroughs to implement a program of stormwater controls these boroughs are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes g nonstormwater discharges to borough separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the borough  931 stormwater management  933

stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes e focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources f maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses g meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa 4a to protect and maintain existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all streams h prevent scour and erosion of
