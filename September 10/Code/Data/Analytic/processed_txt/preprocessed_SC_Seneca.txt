encourage all residential water customers to voluntarily reduce overall monthly water usage to seventy 70 percent of the customers monthly average if voluntary reduction of usage is not successful the city and seneca light and water may at its option implement the following excessive use rate schedule for water tier i 0  225 gallonsreu regular rate tier ii 226  400 gallonsreu two 2 times regular rate tier iii over 400 gallonsreu three 3 times regular rate c impose a drought surcharge per thousand gallons of water that increases with higher usage the general principle behind the drought surcharge is that the fee is imposed on water use in excess of seventy 70 percent of normal monthly use the drought surcharge is a temporary fee imposed during the current water supply shortage and is not a costbased rate the drought surcharge is temporary and will be terminated at such time as the city and seneca light and water determines the water supply is above the trigger levels d if the conservation measures of the article or plan prove inadequate to mitigate the effects of the drought conditions or water supply availability the city and seneca light and water may take additional

authorization the legislature of the state of south carolina has in sc laws title 5 and title 6 and amendments thereto delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of seneca south carolina does ordain as follows b findings of fact the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this article to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the article prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this article are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of the article are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this article is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs d lands to which this article applies this article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city as identified by the federal
