treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventative maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph 3 below are met 3 a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and c the user has submitted the following information to the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days i a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance ii the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and iii steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance 4 in any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof 5 users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards 6 users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails b prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in of this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its cdps permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements pursuant to 40 cfr a2 the affirmative defense outlined in paragraph b of this not apply to the specific prohibitions in paragraphs c1 3 and 6 of c bypass 1 for the purposes of this section  a bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs c3 and c4 of this notice a if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the director at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible b a user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times  and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass the director may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours 4 bypass is prohibited and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under paragraph c3 of this director may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its
