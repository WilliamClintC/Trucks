instead of subdividing an entire tract of land into lots of conventional size and arrangement a similar number of lots can be arranged on the land in a more innovative fashion which better fits the topography and natural attributes of the site the remaining land in the tract that has not been built upon shall be set aside for open space or integrated among the housing units and reserved for usable common open space this open space designation shall be held in a form of ownership that will prevent it from being further subdivided or developed zoning town of londonderry nh    the purpose for establishing this section is to promote a development pattern that creates areas of useable and accessible open space provides land for open space prevents disruption of natural topography and drainage systems maintains the rural and open character of the undeveloped area of the town  protects historically significant buildings resources andor landscapes  protects valuable wildlife areas  allows for attractive site design  encourages a more environmentally practical utility and street network  and assists the town in the goals of protecting open space and providing housing alternatives as outlined in the master plan  objectives a to provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of land b to preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater floodplains wetlands streams steep slopes woodlands and wildlife habitat c to permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure including paved surfaces and utility easements necessary for residential development d to reduce soil erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development e to encourage interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community f to encourage contiguous green space with adjacent jurisdictions g to encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood h to encourage street design that reduces traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries i to encourage construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles j to conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space k to protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic activity l to preserve important historic and archaeological sites  general regulations a applications of regulations this conservation subdivision option is available as a use by right in the ari zoning district the applicants shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning ordinance and all other applicable regulations except those that are incompatible with the provisions

and which require the construction of a new roadway to access newly subdivided lots shall be required to utilize the conservation subdivision requirements of this section for any subdivision of the land for housing development b housing density determination the maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following methods at the discretion of the applicant zoning town of londonderry nh    1 calculation method the maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning 2 where public sewer is not available the maximum density for a conservation subdivision using the calculation method will be established by using table 33 of of this ordinance and computing a total soil carrying capacity of all allowed soils found in the parcel proposed for subdivision the soil carrying capacity of any soil is to be calculated by dividing the given area of any soil type by the required area for that soil type found in table 33 the resulting number shall be multiplied by 85 percent to obtain the maximum number of dwelling lots permitted in the conservation subdivision 3 where public sewer is available the maximum density will be established by using table 32 of of this ordinance divided by the total area of the entire parcel to be subdivided 4 in using the calculation method for determining the maximum number of lots the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel a slopes over 25% of at least 5000 square feet contiguous area  b the 100year floodplain  c drainage easements  and d wetlands that meet the definition of this ordinance 5 yield plan method the maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan prepared by the applicant in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible the plan does not have to meet formal requirements for a site design plan but the design must be capable of being constructed given site feature and all applicable regulations c lot area and shape 1 the minimum lot size prior to subdivision for a conservation subdivision is 20 acres in common beneficial ownership the minimum frontage for the development shall be a contiguous 100 feet and of sufficient length to provide safe access for a rightofway of at least 50 feet 2 minimum lot size a for lots connected to public or community water and sewer the minimum lot size in a conservation subdivision shall be one half  acre in size b for lots connected to public or community sewer but utilizing an onsite well for water service the minimum lot size in a conservation subdivision shall be one half  acre in size c for lots connected to public or community water but utilizing an onsite septic system the minimum lot size in a conservation subdivision shall be one half  of the total calculated minimum lot size using table 33 of of this ordinance or  acre whichever is greater d for lots serviced by an onsite well and an onsite septic system the minimum lot size in a conservation subdivision shall be the total calculated minimum lot size using table 33

criteria all density bonuses are subject to approval of a conditional use permit from the planning board and each bonus is computed on the base density as defined in c above for example if a conservation subdivision was approved for 100 units and had two density bonuses of 10% each the total authorized units would be 120 not 100 x 11 x 11   121 a where the proposed conservation subdivision plan shows 50% or more of the total parcel as open space protected as such in perpetuity the development may be awarded a density bonus of 10% b public access bonus where the public is granted access to the open space or a small 5 spaces or less offstreet gravel parking area for people to access open space is provided the development may be awarded a density bonus of 5% the intent of the bonus is permit pedestrian use the planning board may reasonably restrict the use of motorized vehicles c agricultural lands and use bonus where the development protects agriculturally valuable lands and provides for their use as such in perpetuity the development may be awarded a density bonus of up to 10% the planning board shall on a casebycase basis determine the bonus percentage by considering the size of the project the quality of the soils and the number of acres of farmland preserved the open space portion preserved for agricultural use must be at least three and onehalf 35 contiguous acres and must be reasonably accessible to receive the maximum bonus it must either have been historically farmed or contain prime statewide or locally significant agricultural soils as shown on nrcs soil maps d additional protection bonus  where the development is able to protect unique characteristics including the following it may be awarded a total density bonus under this up to

in the administration of parking requirements set forth in of the site plan regulations when it finds that at least one of the following criteria is met and such deviations are consistent with the purpose and intent of the zoning site plan regulations a the applicant is able to demonstrate of similar uses or similar facilities that the actual parking demand for the property is significantly different from the requirements of can document that there have been no parking shortages at such studied sites b the applicant is requesting a permanent shared parking arrangement for a multitenant site a mixeduse development or a shared parking agreement with an adjacent property c alternate transportation modes are available to be implemented and the applicant has demonstrated to the

rooms assigned to each use and the days and hours of operation of each use for each day of the week and for any seasonal variations in operations b a complete and accurate description of the number of employees and their respective shifts if applicable c to calculate optimal parking requirements based on an estimated peak operating time for mixeduse developments commercial centers and sites with multiple users start by computing the parking required for each use separately utilizing the parking requirements in table b the computation should set predetermined time periods over the course of 24 hours for both weekdays and weekends eg  pm to  am  am to  am  am to  pm and  pm to  pm the first calculation assigns the percentage of total users for each time period the second calculation assigns the parking requirement for each use to determine how many parking spaces are required for each time period the result of this exercise will show the highest number of parking spaces anticipated at any one time period which becomes the parking requirement for the site ii in all cases at least twothirds 23s of the number of required parking spaces shall be provided 3 future parking the planning board may require the submission of a future parking plan as part of the site plan approval if required the board shall allow a reduction in the number of parking spaces actually constructed as long

defined as follows 1 disability glare the eyes lineofsight contact with a direct light source which causes a partial blindness 2 footcandle a unit of measure for illuminance a unit of illuminance on a surface that is everywhere one foot from a uniform point source of light of one candle and equal to one lumen per square foot 3 full cut off type fixture  a luminaire or light fixture that  by design of the housing does not allow any light dispersion or direct glare to shine above 90 degree horizontal plane from the base of the fixture full cutoff fixtures must be installed in a horizontal position as designed or the purpose of the design is defeated and disability glare will result 4 horizontal illuminance the measurement of brightness from a light source usually measured in footcandles or lumens which is taken light meters sensor at a horizontal position 5 light trespass light from an artificial light source that is intruding into an area where it is not wanted or does not belong 6 uplighting any light source that distributes illumination above a 90 degree horizontal plane 7 uniformity ratio u ratio  describes the average level of illumination in relation to the lowest level of illumination for a given area example u ratio   for the given area the lowest level of illumination 1 should be no less than 25% or 4 times less than the average 4  level of illumination b purpose it is the goal of this section to provide further guidance to developers in implementing the lighting sections of the londonderry zoning it is also the goal of this section to establish minimum requirements for lighting for all nonresidential projects nonresidential projects include multifamily proposals recognizing that inappropriate and poorly designed or installed outdoor lighting causes unsafe and unpleasant conditions limits residents ability to enjoy the nighttime sky and results in unnecessary use of electric power conversely it is also recognized that some outdoor lighting is appropriate in areas such as civic commercial and industrial centers to ensure appropriate lighting while minimizing its undesirable side effects the following regulations are established c general requirements 1 that all exterior lights and illuminated signs shall be designed located installed and directed  of 100 revised 1102018 in such a manner as to prevent objectionable light and glare across the property lines and disability glare at any location on or off the property the maintained horizontal illuminance recommendation set by the illuminating engineers society of north america ies shall be observed see appendix light 1 2 all parking area lighting shall be full cutoff type fixtures 3 uplighting is not permitted externally lit signs display building and aesthetic lighting must be shielded to prevent direct glare andor light trespass over property lines in excess of 02 footcandles except at driveway intersections with streets or at interconnections with adjacent parking lots the lighting must also be as much as physically possible contained to the target area internally lit signs are acceptable provided that they meet the requirements of the londonderry zoning all building lighting for security or aesthetics will be full cutoff or a shielded type not allowing any upward distribution of light flood lighting is discouraged and if used must be shielded to prevent i disability glare for drivers or pedestrians ii light trespass beyond the property line and iii light above a 90 degree horizontal plane unshielded wallpack type fixtures are not acceptable 5 adjacent to residential property no direct light source will be visible at the property line at ground level or above 6 all nonessential lighting will be required to be turned off after business hours leaving only the necessary lighting for security nonessential can apply to display aesthetic parking and sign lighting 7 when outdoor lighting

part of its site plan approval 8 lighting of gas stationconvenience store aprons and canopies all of the above standards shall apply as well as the standards in appendix light 2 9 when an outdoor lighting installation is being modified extended expanded or added to the entire outdoor lighting installation shall be subject to the requirements of this section 10 expansion additions or replacements to outdoor lighting installations shall be designed to avoid harsh contrast in color and or lighting levels 11 electrical service to outdoor lighting fixtures shall be underground 12 proposed lighting installations that are not covered in this section may be approved if the planning board finds that they are designed to minimize glare do not direct light beyond the boundaries in excess of 02 footcandles of the area being illuminated or onto adjacent properties or streets and do not result in excessive lighting levels the uratio for any site may not be greater than  13 for the purposes of these regulations the mounting height of a lighting fixture shall be defined as the vertical distance from the grade elevation of the surface being illuminated to the bottom of the lighting fixture ie luminaire 14 temporary 3 months holiday lighting during the months of november december and january shall be exempt for the provisions of this section provided that such lighting does not create dangerous glare or adjacent streets or properties 15 the planning board may modify the requirements of this section if it determines that in so doing it will not jeopardize the intent

purpose the purpose of this annex is to provide guidelines in order that the community and its citizens can recover from the effects of a disaster as rapidly as possible own initiative and with state andor federal assistance b authorities  the authorities for this annex are those as stated in authorites c situation 1 the length of the recovery period will vary depending on the type and magnitude of the disaster and the community may have to begin recovery operations without assistance for an indefinite period until state andor federal assistance becomes available help from state andor federal sources would become available when and if the communitys capability to perform the necessary recovery operations is exceeded however in spite of the completeness of recovery operations londonderry could not expect to return to predisaster normality either physically economically or mentally 2 manpower equipment and supplies are the tools necessary to accomplish the recovery operations and an indeterminate number of people and amounts of equipment and supplies would probably survive any type of disaster the citizens would probably agree to help each other voluntarily if unaffected by the disaster this community would assist to the best of its capabilities affected communities to recover 3 priority in recovery operations must be given to providing the survivors with shelter food water medical treatment clothing and sanitation facilities restoration of communications capabilities must also be accorded a high priority contaminated areas must be secured from entry until the state division of public health deems these areas safe instructions on the use or nonuse of contaminated foods andor water will be disseminated 4 damage assessment economic impact and human needs reports should be completed as soon as possible so that the federal emergency management agency fema may adjudge the criteria for federal disaster assistance the state emergency management agency would help the community to apply for various federal disaster assistance programs as proscribed in the state emergency management plan d organization  under the general direction of the manager all departments with their manpower and equipment would be involved in recovery operations along with volunteer manpower and equipment from local sources town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety

sufficiently and the damaged area has been deemed safe to enter recovery operations must begin based on priorities determined by the manager under the direction of the town council rescue and treatment of the injured clearing of essential streets and roads and restoring communications capabilities and public utilities are the highest priority operations the manager must assess the communitys capability to perform these functions and request local andor state assistance where town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  52 deficiencies exist human

of nh maintain a disaster response plan to assist affected communities in damage assessment and affected citizens in claims settlements and can be contacted emergency management 3 as soon as the preliminary damage assessment and human needs assessment reports are completed this information must be transmitted to the state emergency management agency for compilation with reports from other communities the governors recommendation to the president or to selected federal agencies for assistance is based on the information received in these reports fema in turn makes its recommendations to the president who will then make the decision on the type of disaster declaration to be issued 4 the type or types of federal assistance that would be available are dependent upon the type of declaration received the federal emergency management agency fema and the state disaster office will provide the lead in dispensing available federal assistance the communitys responsibilities and

of this annex is to recognize that there are potential dangers to the lives and property of the citizens of londonderry and that there are programs available to prevent or lessen the effects of these dangers b authorities  the authorities for this annex are those as stated in authorities and applicable local zoning ordinances c situation 1 the comprehensive hazard analysis shows that the community could be subjected to the damaging effects of several hazards various programs are available to prevent or lessen these effects in order that these mitigation programs be effective certain regulations andor ordinances must be enacted by the community and must be accomplished during a precrisis period 2 the citizens would be receptive to initiating mitigation programs when the potential benefits are properly explained private companies which might present potential hazards to the community would cooperate with officials to plan for mitigating these hazards the state emergency management agency would be available to explain these programs and to assist in the plans preparation 3 the community currently is participating in the regular phase of the national flood insurance program and has enacted regulations against building in flood plains without floodproofing etc d organization town council manager emergency management director planning council zoning board building inspector town

hazardous materials highhazard dams etc d a tiedown ordinance for mobile homes e industrial zoning regulations 2 by recognizing that it is generally less expensive to mitigate the damaging effects of a disaster than it is to recover from them the citizens can provide themselves with a greater measure of safety and security also the community should realize that many federal disaster assistance programs now require that state andor local funding in the amount of 25% be used to match the federal funding of 75% in this manner the federal government is encouraging communities to enact

destructiondomestic terrorism contingency plan a introduction  general the ability of federal state and local government agencies to respond to and respond decisively to terrorist attacks against our citizens when they happen domestically was codified in presidential decision directive 39 pdd39 this directive built upon previous directives for combating terrorism and further defined the strategic and planning functions that provided for interagency coordination the responsibility for the management of this domestic threat was given to the fbi as the lead federal agency lfa for the operational response to a weapons of mass destruction wmd incident the federal emergency management agency  fema is responsible for preparing for or responding to the consequences of a wmd incident with participation by the us public health service healthmedical the epa hazmat and environmental and the doe radiological as necessary these federal decisions recognize that wmd incidents are multidisciplinary multijurisdictional events that require a broad interagency planning and response approach as well as a cooperative partnership between federal state and local governments the south eastern new hampshire hazardous materials mutual aid district senhhmmad recognizes the potential for these types of events the purpose of this plan is to define the supporting role that the senhhmmad communities provide in wmd situations this plan defines the scope of responsibility that the senhhmmad hazmat team has in responding to wmd events where the local community and the local plan have been overwhelmed due to the size or consequence of the event b differences between wmd and other incidents 1 wmd incidents may involve mass casualties and damage to buildings or other types of property however there are several factors surrounding wmd incidents that are unlike any other type of incident that must be considered when planning a response emergency responders ability to identify aspects of the incident eg signs and symptoms exhibited by victims report them accurately and protect themselves will be essential to maximize the use of critical local resources that may occur at the local level some of the recognition factors that first responders should use to detect the possible occurrence of wmd incidents would be the following a the situation may not be recognized as a wmd event until there are multiple casualties some chemical and biological agents may not be detectable by methods used for detection of explosives radiological material and firearms most chemicalbiological agents can be carried in containers that look like ordinary items chapter x  emergency management plan contd town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  61 functional annexes  weapons of mass destructiondomestic terrorism contingency plan b differences between wmd and other incidents contd 1 there may be multiple events eg one event in an attempt to influence another events outcome 2 responders are placed at a higher risk of becoming casualties because biological and chemical agents are not always readily identifiable 3 responders may become contaminated before recognizing the agent involved emergency responders may in addition be targets for secondary releases or explosions 4 contamination of critical facilities and large geographic areas may result victims may carry an agent unknowingly to public transportation facilities businesses residences doctors offices walkin medical clinics or emergency rooms they do this because they do not realize that they are contaminated 5 the scope of the incident may expand geometrically and may affect the mutual aid system airborne agents flow with the air current and if disseminated via ventilation systems may carry the agents far from the initial source 6 there will be a stronger public reaction in wmd incidents than with any other types of incidents the thought of exposure to a chemical or biological agent or radiation evokes terror in most people the fear of the unknown also heightens the public response 7 time is working against the responding elements the incident can expand geometrically and very quickly in addition the effects of some chemicals and biological agents worsen over time there is a potential for the resuspension of the agent to an airborne state of contamination thus time is of the essence in onscene activity this should be tempered with the realization that the incident is a crime scene 8 local support facilities such as fire stations police stations public drinking water disinfecting facilities and utility stations and communication facilities may be at risk as targets c crisis and consequence management 1 crisis management addresses the causes of a terrorism incident the identity motivation and capability of the terrorists and the weapons they employ crisis management is a law enforcement function senhhmmad recognizes that the law enforcement role is to measure to identify acquire and plan the use of resources needed to anticipate prevent and or to resolve a threat of act of terrorism chapter x  emergency management plan contd town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  62 functional annexes  weapons of mass destructiondomestic terrorism contingency plan c crisis and consequence management contd 1 in a terrorist incident a crisis management response may include traditional law enforcement missions  such as intelligence surveillance tactical operations behavioral assessment negations forensics and investigations other functions such as technical support missions agent identification search render safe procedures transfer and disposal and limited decontamination 2 the fbi is designated as the lead agency for crisis management in this role the fbi traditionally employs a topdown command approach this system manages a crisis from an fbi command post which brings in the necessary assets to respond and resolve the threat or incident these activities primarily coordinate the law enforcement actions responding to the cause of the incident with state and local agencies providing support 3 during a crisis situation the fbi special agent in charge sac of the local field division will establish a command post to manage the threat based upon a graduated and flexible response a this command post structure generally consists of three functional groups command operations and support it is designed to accommodate participation from other agencies as appropriate b when the threat or incident exceeds the capabilities of the local fbi field division the sac can request additional resources from the regional fbi divisions fbihq and the critical incident response group cirg located in quantico virginia to augment existing crisis management capabilities 4 in a terrorist threat of incident the traditional fbi command post is expanded into a joint operations center joc incorporating a fourth functional entity the consequence management group the consequence management group consists of representatives from federal state and local consequence management organizations these groups address the prerelease and postrelease consequence operations this expansion of the command post into a joc allows the fbi to manage crisis and consequence operations concurrently 5 consequence management addresses how the incident affects or potentially might affect public health safety and the environment consequence management includes measures to protect public health safety and the environment to restore essential government services and to provide emergency relief to governments businesses and individuals affected by the consequences of terrorism chapter x  emergency management plan contd town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  63 functional annexes  weapons of mass destructiondomestic terrorism contingency plan c crisis and consequence management contd 6 consequence management contd in an actual or potential terrorist incident a consequence management response will be managed by fema using structures and resources provided by the federal response plan these efforts will include support missions as described in other federal operations plans such as predictive modeling protective action recommendations and mass decontamination 7 state and local governments will most likely be the first to respond to the consequences of terrorism  the federal government will provide assistance as required state and local agencies may have authorities that overlap federal jurisdictions 8 unlike crisis management the federal government does not have primary responsibility for consequence management but supports state and local governments fema using the federal response plan directs and coordinates all federal response efforts to manage the consequences in domestic incidents for which the president has declared or expressed intent to declare and emergency fema employs a bottomup approach in coordinating the federal response thorough the frp marshalling federal resources state emergency management center eoc in support of the local government 9 the fbi has developed a fourtiered system of describing a developing situation and the thresholds at which particular federal wmd assets should in general be called upon to respond to incidents or threat condition the threat levels are a threat level 4  minimal threat received threats do not warrant actions beyond normal liaison notifications or placing assets or resources on a heightened alert agencies are operating under normal daytoday conditions b threat level 3  potential threat intelligence or an articulated threat indicate a potential for a terrorist incident however this threat has not been assessed as credible 1 this should initiate the credibility assessment process 2 notify fbi immediately 3 as part of the ongoing contingency planning process during the developing crisis deployment plans for followup resources should be made should they be required

plan c crisis and consequence management contd 1 the fbi has developed a four tiered systemcontd c threat level 2  credible threat a threat assessment indicates that the potential threat is credible and confirms the involvement of wmd in the developing terrorist incident intelligence will vary with each threat and will impact the level of the federal response led by the fbi the federal focus will be on law enforcement actions taken in the interests of public safety and welfare and is predominantly concerned with preventing and resolving the threat fema will support the federal response with consequence management planning and prepositioning of tailored resources as required the threat increases in significance when the presence of an explosive device of wmd capable of causing a significant destructive event before actual injury or loss is confirmed alternatively when intelligence and circumstances indicates a high probability that the device exists in this case the threat has developed into a wmd terrorist situation this requires an immediate process to identify acquire and plan the use of federal augmentation to state and local authorities in response to the potential consequence of a terrorist use or employment of wmd 1 deployment of the domestic emergency support team dest to provide assistance should be considered or requested as the situation develops and warrants followup resources should be requested 2 a joint operations center joc should be established to manage the developing crisis in the interagency environment incorporating law enforcement planning concerns with consequence management concerns d threat level 1  wmd incident a wmd terrorism incident has occurred which requires an immediate process to identify acquire and plan the use of federal augmentation to state and local authorities in response to limited or major consequences of a terrorist use or employment of wmd this incident has resulted in mass casualties the federal response is primarily directed toward public safety and welfare and the preservation of human life 1 fema would lead the federal governments efforts to respond to the devastation management in support

management concerns with the law enforcement effort the perpetrators may have additional devices the investigation should continue under the joc command concept until the threat of additional devices is mitigated  or other contingencies regarding the incident are resolved the incident site may expand to multiple sites which can be strategically coordinated by the joc 2 authorized personnel only should approach all chemical biological or nuclear material which includes the hazardous materials response unit 3 untrained personnel should inspect known or suspected chemical biological or nuclear materials fieldtesting and transportation for lab testing is to be coordinated with the hazardous materials response unit d incident response  role of senhhmmad in crisis and consequence management any violent act or an act dangerous to human life that may include weapons of mass destruction that serves to intimidate or coerce the citizens and political subdivisions living under the senhhmmad jurisdiction is of great concern to our member communities 1 preemergency  crisis management as it relates to senhhmmad will be a proactive process that is evolutionary in nature it is our commitment to train all senhhmmad personnel in the basic response concepts in terrorism and wmd incidents in addition to that the senhhmmad hazmat team has been trained in the 16 hour national fire academy course in emergency response to terrorism also members of the hazmat team are encouraged to attend the cobra wmd hazardous materials technician training course at the center for domestic preparedness chapter x  emergency management plan contd town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  66 functional annexes  weapons of mass destructiondomestic terrorism contingency plan d incident response  role of senhhmmad in crisis and consequence managementcontd 1 it is the responsibility of each local community to identify and preplan those facilities and locations that may have some sensitivity as potential targets for terrorist activities some examples of these types of facilities might include a fire stations police stations communications centers planned parenthood clinics government facilities medical facilities utility facilities power plants churches water purification facilities communication infrastructures public transportation modes b this pre planning process should be incorporated into the local plans in order for senhhmmad personnel to access and implement the preplan actions crisis management refers in a general sense to pre emergency activities 3 senhhmmad is striving to meet its responsibilities in terrorism response by preparing its personnel for such contingencies the preplanning function is incumbent upon the local community with the support and cooperation of the senhhmmad in helping prepare for terrorist incidents member communities can plan prepare train exercise strategies and tactics that can minimize the potential for harm to the general population and the district responders when responding to terrorism incidents with the potential for wmd some local considerations that can be assessed in the local community are a resources need to protect populations b level of public awareness education and training c evacuation routes d availability of sufficient resources e site security and agency responsibilities 4 the emergency response challenge for the local communities within senhhmmad is indeed profound the recognized protocols observed by the local communities as well as the senhhmmad response team shall be implemented at all incidents involving or suspected to involve wmd it is recognized that if the incident is a potential act of terrorism it is also a crime scene it is understood that crime scene considerations will be a complicating factor in emergency response operations chapter x  emergency management plan contd town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  67 functional annexes  weapons of mass destructiondomestic terrorism contingency plan e emergency response operation  initial response 1 it is imperative that all senhmmad consequence personnel shall remain focused on reducing the impact of the event as safely and efficiently as possible all responders shall follow established senhhmmad standard operating procedures sops at all times public safety will largely depend on the ability of our responders to effectively conduct hazard and risk analysis of the affected population it is recognized by federal agencies that strategies used by the senhhmmad hazmat team during hazardous materials incidents should be applied to a terrorist event 2 the safety of the public will in large measure depend on the ability of the responders to effectively conduct a hazard and risk analysis of the affected area and population the most effective way to realize these goals is implement rapid decisions based on sound sizeup techniques which consider the implementation of public protection measures when escalating dangers exist these practices and procedures shall take into consideration the health and safety of the responders at all times 3 it is a challenging task at any significant incident to continually gather information and factor in the information and translate that into the best decision all recognized risk management principles shall be applied in order to reduce the risk to tolerable levels in any given circumstance 4 protection of senhhmmad personnel is based on avoiding or minimizing exposure principals of time distance and shielding proven tactical methods used in conventional hazmat situations that include  isolation evacuation denial of entry and hazard identification should be implemented a selfprotection measure for senhhmmad personnel is to understand the various types of harm that members may be exposed to the acronym tracem can be utilized to understand the concepts thermal radiological asphyxiation chemical etiological mechanical 5 during a large scale wmd event senhhmmad personnel shall consider the following options for the protecting of the public a evacuation of all threatened populations a protection in place for all b combination of evacuation and protection in place by evacuating some populations and protecting others in place chapter x  emergency management

materials containers 5 other anomalies h plans tentative escape routes and refuge assembly points i prepare for emergency decontamination on arrival and during all phases of the incident 7 although the incident may overwhelm the first arriving district units efforts to gain control must start immediately regardless of the resources on hand the concept of work zones should be implemented when task oriented activities are taking place the emphasis is on firefighter health and safety and this should be of the utmost concern to local incident commanders the senhhmmad team in these types of operations will respond identically to the rules and standard operating procedures that have been adopted for convention hazmat response chapter x  emergency management plan contd functional annexes  weapons of mass destructiondomestic town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  69 terrorism contingency plan contd f concept of operations  biological agents 1 the most practical method of initiating infection using biological agents is mists sprays and fumes which are in essence fine particles that are sprayed over or upwind of a target because of the size of the particles they have the potential to be inhaled an aerosol may be effective for some time after the delivery the aerosol will be deposited on such items as clothing equipment and soil when the clothing is used at a later time interval or if dust is stirred up the public as well as first responders may be subject to secondary contamination 2 biological agents may be able to be delivered routes of entry into the body other than the respiratory tract individuals may be infected or contaminated of the agent natural body functions as eating and drinking or direct contact with the skin or mucous membranes openings in the protective clothing of the responders full respiratory protection scba with level chemical protective clothing is essential 3 biological agents are unique in the fact that symptoms of exposure may occur minutes hours days or weeks after an incident has occurred the time required before symptoms are observed is dependent on the agent used there are currently no monitoring devices available for first responders to use for determining if biological agents are involved in an incident work continues on developing test methods but often the first clue will come from blood tests or by other means used by medical personnel another method is by observing possible symptoms of people exposed in the area g concept of operations  chemical agents 1 as in conventional hazmat responses there are many clues that may be present to indicate that a wmd event has occurred some of the clues are a unusual numbers of dying animals are present b lack of insect life if normal insect activity is absent check the ground or water surfaces or interfaces for dead insects c numerous individuals are experiencing unexplained waterlike blisters wheals bee sting like and or rashes d numerous individuals are exhibiting serious health problems ranging from nausea to disorientation to having difficulty breathing to convulsions to death these types of occurrences should make it apparent that there is a mass casualty event in progress chapter x  emergency management plan contd functional annexes  weapons of mass destructiondomestic town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  70 terrorism contingency plan contd g concept of operations  chemical agents contd 1 as in conventional hazmat responses there are many clues contd e there is the presence of unusual liquid droplets numerous surfaces exhibit oily droplets or film  numerous water surfaces have an oily film these conditions should be abnormal to the current weather conditions ie no recent rain and not the accumulation of pollen or algae f unusual and or unscheduled spraying of the environment g abandoned spray devices such as chemical sprayers used by landscaping crews h unexplained odors are present it is important to note that the particular odor is completely out of character with the surroundings for instance the smell of garlic which would be indicative of a mustard agent i the possible mixing of critical agents presents an additional concern to first responders because this process will make it extremely difficult to identify the type and the toxic constituents of the chemical agent remember in such cases the only way to begin identification of the chemical agent is to observe the symptoms present in the victims first responders should take caution because without advance warning first responders may become victims in such an incident the health and safety of first responders is of paramount concern if first responders become part of the problem the entire delivery of services breaks down h concept of operations  nuclear and radiological 1 the problem with radiation is that it is an invisible hazard unless the responding local community has adequate radiation detection equipment or if the source material is clearly marked and identified there is a strong chance that the initial identification will go unnoticed by responders additionally there is no single instrumentation device that is capable of detecting all forms of radiation the technology is still only capable detecting each separate types of radiation 2 the primary consideration of first responders is respiratory protection scba and personal protective equipment in sufficient quantity to protect senhhmmad personnel when presence of alpha or beta particles are detected or suspected chapter x  emergency management plan contd functional annexes  weapons of mass destructiondomestic town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  71 terrorism contingency plan contd h concept of operations  nuclear and radiological contd 3 the following are some general concerns that should be considered when responding to an incident involving nuclear or radiological materials a if it is known or believed that radioactive material has been released it should be assumed that personnel and property might be contaminated this means clothing equipment vehicles buildings and the ground b experts such a health physicians radiological and safety offices or department of energy experts will be needed to identify the exact nature of the nuclear or radiological material c if the source of contamination is known a hot line outside perimeter of a hot zone needs to be established to prevent further contamination of the area and personnel if the source is unknown the limits of the contamination must be found so a hot line and clean area can be established d prior to establishing a hot line a determination will have to be made as whether the radioactive material is or is not scattered around the area and has or has not contaminated shoes clothing uncovered head and arms or legs vehicles equipment and other material in the area e a radiological monitoring expert or a health physician must make estimates of an individuals radiation exposure doses this is a matter for experienced radiation monitoring experts however all first responding senhhmmad personnel should ideally be equipped with individual dosimeters so such experts can measure the amount of exposure in event that an incident occurs involving radiation material the health and safety of response personnel is critical personnel should be advised of the hazards and operations should be defensive in nature risk and exposure of senhhmmad personnel after a risk assessment process has occurred shall be to a minimized due to the fact that protection strategies are limited f senhhmmad response personnel must be evaluated for contamination by conducting the following protocols 1 perform a survey of clothing ambulances police cruisers equipment etc before undertaking further action or activity 2 if contamination is detected items such clothing should be discarded in a container marked radioactive  do not discard personal hygiene including appropriate selfwashing and or showing should occur chapter x  emergency management plan contd town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  72 functional annexes  weapons of mass destructiondomestic terrorism contingency plan contd h concept of operations  nuclear and radiological contd 3 the following are some general concernscontd f senhhmmad response personnel must be evaluated for contamination by conducting the following protocols contd 1 if in contaminated areas district first responders must be surveyed by a radiation survey meter the measurements must be recorded any levels of concern are indicative of emergency medical monitoring for those individuals affected cleaning and decontamination will continue until a responsible and competent individual indicates the all clear g equipment shall be surveyed and if indications from a competent persons will dictate the method to accomplish these procedures 4 the rescue of victims is dependent on what type of radioactive material is involved in the incident the important thing is to remove the victims from the source area remember the longer individuals and response personnel remain in the hot zone the higher the dose of radiation that will be absorbed i concept of operations  alpha particles  as long as first responders have scba and firefighting gear is donned the level of protection provided by fire gear is sufficient for the rapid removal of victims this is the same procedure currently in existence within the senhhmmad for any hazmat situation j concept of operations  beta particles  scba and fully encapsulating level a will not be enough to work in the source area quick in and out carry and drag of victims away from the source may be the only way to rescue victims this should only be conducted when the risk assessment process identifies this is the only viable method of removing victims k concept of operations  gamma xray and neutrons  typical effective shielding materials such as lead for gamma radiation and hydrogen containing materials for neutron radiation are not practical shielding materials for neutron radiation and are not practical shielding materials for first responders they are too heavy the only effective way is to decrease the exposure to first responders is to limit the amount of time in the hazardous environment this option should be only considered as last resort careful consideration should be given before committing personnel to this type of operation if the presence of nuclear or radiological material is suspected personnel should not enter the area under any circumstance without respiratory protective equipment an appropriate action would be to cordon off the suspect area and prevent entry of any personnel until the proper monitoring can be initiated town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare

events 1 in the event that a wmd event is occurring or has occurred the state of new hampshire wmd emergency notification resource list should be consulted for the appropriate notification a copy of this updated list follows on page of this document 2 when it has been determined that the situation requires a response beyond the capabilities of the local fire department derry fire dispatch shall be notified that a wmd event is in progress bear in mind that the appropriate level of response from the district is a level four activation because of the potential for or actual release of a wmd such indicators of a wmd are located in the form located on page of this document 3 life safety for responders is critical to the success of any response to wmd events senhhmmad has determined that these types of incidents will be handled identical to conventional hazmat responses therefore all federal state and local health and safety regulations will be followed  and team operations will be

local responders prior to the arrival of the senhhmmad team 5 the senhhmmad has identified the janes chembio handbook as the resource tool for all responders within the district for the purposes of this plan it shall be adopted as the field manual for use in any and all wmd potential or actual events this tool can be integrated with other recognized resources such as but not limited to the north american emergency response guidebook dot guidebook and the niosh pocketguide for chemicals and the senhhmmad scariepm form all of which are resources currently recognized as valuable in hazmat operations 6 the agent indicator matrix located on  of the chembio handbook is a critical tool in helping first responders to help determine the agent type by gathering information on the scene bear in mind that this tool is designed to give the best approximation of the agent used but is not considered definitive until confirmed by hazmat or medical personnel however this tool can help responders learn of the effects and the treatment algorithms for particular chemicals or agents town of londonderry adopted  title iv  public health safety welfare revised  74 chapter x  emergency

crime scene management and protocol procedures control measures 1 to prevent further contamination to personnel crowd control is imperative victims people inside the hot zone when you arrived should be contained and unauthorized individuals should not be allowed to enter the hot zone 2 maintain inner and outer perimeters in conjunction with law enforcement 3 maintain clear routes of entry and exit for emergency vehicles and personnel 4 direct victims showing no signs of exposure to a holding area inside the hot zone but well away from the decon station for evaluation by the hazmat team 5 all individuals showing signs of contamination should be directed to the hot zone for immediate decon procedures 6 most victims will leave the scene to get medical attention at a facility prior to the arrival of response personnel this necessitates that similar crowd control and decon be set up at those facilities 8 it is conceivable that emergency responders could become exposed to an agent during an incident it is vital that personnel do not panic if they suspect that there has been an actual or potential exposure although the levels of ppe issued to firefighters does not offer chemical protection many cases the awareness of a wmd event may not happen for a time during the response survival and prevention of further exposure depends on the steps taken to remove the agent or chemical

3 litter patient decon remember these procedures should not supercede notification of the senhhmmad team but serve as a stop gap measure until the team can be deployed the rule of thumb for response
