be the per student allocation for each school classification for each school district thereupon the village board may determine the percentage of estimated children to be served by each such school classification from each family unit and may apply each percentage against the per student allocation for each school classification for each school district thereby determining the payment to be made by the subdivid~r as each family units is initially occupied 706  dedication and development of detention ponds or funds in libu thereof a contribution of and development of detention ponds or funds
