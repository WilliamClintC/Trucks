agreement must be recorded with the deed if a variance is granted and the accessory structure is not elevated or dry flood proofed the conditions in apply the board of zoning appeals shall notify in writing any applicant to whom a variance is granted to construct or substantially improve a building or structure with its lowest floor below the elevation required by these regulations that the variance is to the floodplain management requirements of these regulations only and that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk with rates up to $25 per $100 of insurance coverage a record of all variance actions including justification for issuance shall be maintained pursuant to j of this application for a variance a the owner of property or the owners authorized agent for which a variance is sought shall submit an application for a variance to the floodplain administrator b at a minimum the application shall contain the following information name address and telephone number of the applicant and property owner  legal description of the property  parcel map  description of the existing use  description of the proposed use  site map showing the location of flood hazard areas designated floodway boundaries flood zones base flood elevations and flood protection setbacks  description of the variance sought  and reason for the variance request

elevation required by these regulations the application shall include a statement signed by the owner that if granted the conditions of the variance shall be recorded on the deed of the property 3 considerations for variances the floodplain administrator shall request comments on variance applications from mde nfip state coordinator and shall provide such comments to the board of zoning appeals in considering variance applications the board of zoning appeals shall consider and make findings of fact on all evaluations all relevant factors requirements specified in other sections of these regulations and the following factors a the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others b the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage c the susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents if applicable to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner d the importance of the services to the community provided by the proposed development e the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to or are subject to less flooding or erosion damage f the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable or if the facility is a functionally dependent use g the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development h the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and hazard mitigation plan for that area i the safety of access to the property in times of flood for passenger vehicles and emergency vehicles j the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site k the costs of providing government services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges l the comments provided by mde nfip state coordinator 4 limitations for granting variances the board of zoning appeals shall make an affirmative decision on a variance request only upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause good and sufficient cause deals solely with the physical characteristics of the property and cannot be based on the character of the improvement the personal characteristics of

physical characteristics of the property increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant c a determination that the granting of a variance for development within any designated floodway or flood hazard area with base flood elevations but no designated floodway will not result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations d a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in additional threats to public safety  extraordinary public expense nuisances fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws e a determination that the building structure or other development is protected by methods to minimize flood damages f a
