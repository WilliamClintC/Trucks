general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed designated key boxes may be accomplished by the utilization of one uniform key system a the flood hazard areas of the township of rochelle park are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and government services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored cause damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss a to protect human life and health b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public d to minimize prolonged

the text of this chapter clearly demonstrates a different meaning when not a elevated levels of nutrients particularly phosphorus in surface water bodies can result in excessive and accelerated growth of algae and aquatic plants eutrophication excessive plant growth can result in diurnal variations and extremes in dissolved oxygen and ph which in turn can be detrimental to aquatic life as algae and plant materials die off the decay process creates a further demand on dissolved oxygen levels the presence of excessive plant matter can also restrict use of the affected water for recreation and water supply b while healthy vegetated areas are protective of water quality by stabilizing soil and filtering precipitation when fertilizers are applied to the land surface improperly or in excess of the needs of target vegetation nutrients can be transported by mean of stormwater to nearby waterways contributing to the problematic growth of excessive aquatic vegetation most soils in new jersey contain sufficient amounts of phosphorus to support adequate root growth for established turf over time it is necessary to replenish available phosphorus but generally not at the levels commonly applied other target vegetation such as vegetable gardens and agriculturalhorticultural plantings will have a greater need for phosphorus application as will the repair or establishment of new lawns or cover vegetation a soils test and fertilizer application recommendation geared to the soil and planting type is the best means to determine the amount of nutrients to apply timing and placement of fertilizer application is also critical to avoid transport of nutrients to waterways runoff fertilizer applied immediately prior to a runoffproducing rainfall outside the growing season or to impervious surfaces is most likely to be carried away by means of runoff without accomplishing the desired objective of supporting target vegetation growth therefore the management of the type amount and techniques for fertilizer application is necessary as one tool to protect water resources  16039 reserved  16041  inconsistent with the context words used in the present tense include the future
