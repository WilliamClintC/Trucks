in nature note dont be hoodwinked by the placement at the back of the book they are designed to meet a couple of objectives first the 2013 charter revision represents the most comprehensive reorganization and restructuring of the charter since the enactment of the home rule charter in 195_ the footnotes reference the sections of the 1993 charter so that the reader may actually be able to reconstruct the changes the thrust of these notes is to establish a pathway to understand and follow the transition from the current charter to the proposed revised charter furthermore these endnotes refer to the special acts other historical documents and source materials the annotation was commenced within both budget and time constraints and should be viewed in that context for example if a section has no historical reference may simply mean that there was not sufficient time to burrow the versions of the charter or special acts to locate the historical foundation for the provision these footnotes should not be relied upon as a definitive research tool or as the foundation for authoritative conclusions of the facts contained herein they should be simply guideposts to the further research that will be necessary to reach any reach such conclusions or objectives 1 modification of the current preamble note a the time this charter was considered in 2013 federal law made it illegal

considerations for granting of fdp variances  in passing upon applications the commission shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance  and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity of the facility of a waterfront location in the case of a functionally dependent facility  6 the availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges  upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of the ordinance the commission may attach such conditions to the granting of fdp variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance  conditions for variances 1 fdp variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief and in the instance of a historical building a determination that the fdp variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building  2 fdp variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship and a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create a nuisance cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 any applicant to whom a fdp variance is granted shall be given a written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage 4 records of all appeal actions shall be maintained and any fdp variances shall be reported to the federal emergency management agency upon request   7113  penalties for violation violation of the provisions of this ordinance or failure to comply with any of its

singlefamily areas of relatively small total size but of unique and irreplaceable value to the community as a whole the specific purpose of these districts is to stabilize and preserve the lowdensity residential character of these areas to the maximum possible extent to this end the use of land and buildings within these areas is limited primarily to singlefamily homes the particular character size and surroundings of these areas create little need for the location within their boundaries of further such nonresidential uses as generally support a lowdensity residential area and the location of any further such uses within these areas would undesirably limit or diminish the number of homes in them it is hereby found and declared that these regulations are necessary for the protection of these areas and that their protection is essential to the maintenance of a balanced community of sound residential areas of diverse types all rs2 districts are subject to the general provisions for residence districts set forth in as well as to all other provisions of this ordinance uses permitted in an rs1 district a building or other structure may be erected altered arranged designed or used

these standards is hereby declared to violate the spirit of this ordinance and the general purpose and intent of these regulations a variance for conversion of an existing building to a greater number of dwelling units may be granted only in accordance with the following standards a it must be clearly demonstrated that continued use of the building with its existing number of dwelling units would create such hardship as would practically destroy or greatly decrease its value provided that 1 the evidence offered to demonstrate such hardship shall not relate to such deterioration of the building as would suggest its removal and reuse of the land for singlefamily detached dwellings in accordance with the provisions of these districts  and 2 before granting a variance for conversion of a principal building the board shall find that such hardship cannot be sufficiently mitigated by subdivision of the lot for one or more additional lots conforming to the standards of these districts for singlefamily detached dwellings or by conversion of an existing accessory building to a singlefamily detached dwelling where such subdivision or such conversion would have a lesser impact upon the surrounding area than would conversion of the principal building to a greater number of dwelling units in accordance with the standards of this paragraph 3 b the building shall have been erected more than 30 years before conversion and any increase of its gross floor area beyond 20% during the ten years immediately preceding conversion shall not be deemed to contribute to hardship under subparagraph 11a3a or be considered in determining the maximum number of allowable dwelling units under subparagraph 11a3c of this paragraph 11a3 c any variance granted for conversion of a building to a greater number of dwelling units shall be for the minimum number of dwelling units necessary to mitigate the hardship and in no case for more dwelling units than are allowable under the requirement that the building and lot in question contain an average of 1500 sq feet  of gross floor area  7500 sq feet  of lot area  and 60 feet  of average lot width per dwelling unit after conversion in the

the surrounding area compared with the public need for them at particular locations such uses and features are therefore treated as special exceptions 1 where provided for elsewhere in this ordinance the board of zoning appeals may in appropriate cases after public notice and hearing grant special exceptions 2 where an existing use or feature which is permitted only by special exception is proposed to be extended or substantially altered in a manner which would in any way change the character or intensity of the use or feature such proposed extension or substantial alteration shall be treated as a special exception under this section 3 special exceptions shall be granted only where the board of zoning appeals finds that the proposed use or feature or the proposed extension or substantial alteration of an existing use or feature is in accord with the public convenience and welfare after taking into account where appropriate a the nature of the proposed site including its size and shape and the proposed size shape and arrangement of structures  b the resulting traffic patterns and adequacy of proposed offstreet parking and loading  c the nature of the surrounding area and the extent to which the proposed use or feature might impair its present and future development  d the proximity of dwellings churches schools public buildings and other places of public gathering

attached such additional conditions and safeguards as are deemed necessary to protect the neighborhood such as but not limited to those listed in paragraph 63c3 of this ordinance failure to comply with any such condition or safeguard shall constitute a violation of this ordinance 6 in the following types of special exception cases which involve more than conventional questions of use and may have a significant impact on surrounding areas and a substantial relationship to the comprehensive plan of the city the board of zoning appeals shall following its hearing refer the case including all exhibits to the city plan commission which shall submit an advisory report on such factors as it may deem relevant to the board within 30 days after receiving all records and documents in the case

or lot is one which existed lawfully whether by variance or otherwise on the date this zoning any amendment thereto became effective and which fails to conform to one or more of the applicable regulations in the zoning such amendment thereto 2 such nonconformities are incompatible with and detrimental to permitted uses  structures and lots in the zoning districts in which they are located  they cause disruption of the comprehensive land use pattern of the city  they inhibit present and future development of nearby properties  and they confer upon their owners and users a position of unfair advantage 3 it is a fundamental principal of zoning law that nonconformities are not to be expanded and that they should be abolished or reduced to conformity as quickly as the fair interests of the parties will permit this principle is declared to be the intent of this ordinance 4 it is the further intent of this ordinance that existing nonconformities shall not cause further departures from the zoning therefore the existence of any present nonconformity anywhere in the city shall not in itself be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance for any other property b general provisions 1 notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance a nonconforming use  structure or lot as defined by subsection 67a above may be continued except as otherwise specified in this section 67 2 no nonconformity shall be deemed to have existed on the date this zoning any amendment thereto became effective unless a it was in being on a continuous basis and to its fullest extent on

changes of title or possession or right of possession of property except in the case of nonconforming lots under section 67e1 c nonconforminguses 1 no nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged extended or altered and no structure or part thereof devoted to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged extended constructed reconstructed or structurally altered except in changing the use to one which

nonconforming use  3 change of use  a no nonconforming use of land or of a structure shall be changed to any use which is substantially different in nature and purpose from the former nonconforming use  except such uses as are permitted in the district in which they are located unless a special exception is granted under subsection 63d of this ordinance upon a finding among other things that the new use will have a lesser impact upon the surrounding area than the old one b where any change is proposed to be made to a use that is permitted in the district only by special exception such change may be made only special exception granted under subsection 63d of this ordinance c when a nonconforming use has been changed to a conforming use  it shall not thereafter be changed to any use not permitted in the district in which the use is located d when a nonconforming use has been wrongfully changed to any use which is substantially different in nature and purpose from the former nonconforming use  such change shall be deemed to constitute abandonment of the former nonconforming use under subparagraph 67c6b of this ordinance 4 in order to assure that structures containing nonconforming uses will be maintained in safe and decent condition for so long as such nonconforming uses continue nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prohibit a work in any period of twelve consecutive months on ordinary repairs and replacement of existing materials with similar materials placed in the same manner to an extent not exceeding 20% of the current replacement value of the structure excluding the value of land the cost of preparation of land and the value of any foundation adaptable to a conforming use  as determined by the zoning enforcement officer zeo  or b any work required by the codes and ordinances of the city or ordered by any city official charged with protecting the public health safety or welfare if such work does not enlarge or extend a nonconforming use or otherwise increase any nonconformity 5 in order to assure that the fair interests of the parties will be protected nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prohibit the restoration of any structure and its use where such structure has been destroyed by any means out of the control of the owner to an extent of 50% or less of its replacement value excluding the value of land the cost of preparation of land and the value of any foundation adaptable to the conforming use  at the time of destruction provided the restoration of such structure and its use in no way increases any former nonconformity and provided further that restoration of such structure is begun within one year of such destruction and diligently prosecuted to completion within two years following such destruction

structure or land or structure and land in combination is located b the term abandonment as used therein shall mean the voluntary discontinuance of a use  when accompanied by an intent not to reestablish such use  any one of the following shall constitute prima facie evidence of intent to abandon 1 any positive act indicating such intent  or 2 any conscious failure to take all necessary steps to resume the nonconforming use with reasonable dispatch in the circumstances including advertising of the property for sale or for lease  or 3 in the case of a structure or of a structure and

governed by subsection 67d however lack of required screening or other safeguards improper use of outdoor areas excessive area occupied by a use  improper arrangement of parking loading or driveways and similar deviations shall be deemed nonconforming uses under this subsection 67c 12 all nonconforming uses shall be subject to the same regulations for arrangement and operation as those that would apply if they were conforming uses  unless such regulations conflict with other applicable regulations see especially section 46 concerning outdoor areas and 48 concerning performance standards d nonconforming structures 1 structures failing to meet any requirement of this ordinance other than use  including lack of required parking or loading shall not be enlarged extended constructed
