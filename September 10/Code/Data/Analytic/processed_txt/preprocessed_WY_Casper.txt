casper municipal code 1989 ____________ a codification of the general ordinances of the city of casper wyoming ____________ beginning with supplement no 35 supplemented by municipal ____________ > preface the casper wyoming municipal originally published by book publishing company in 198 has been kept current by regular supplementation by matthew bender & company inc its successor in interest beginning with supplement no 35 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of robert l mullen city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 35 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers this supplement brings the code up to date no 619 adopted  municipal capital circle sw tallahassee fl 32310 8002622633 how to use your code this code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with supplement no 35 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end these history notes can be cross referenced to the table

applicable to the laws of the municipality as the statutes are revised these references will be updated crossreference table when a code is based on an earlier codification the crossreference table will help users find older or prior code references in the new code the crossreference table is located near the end of the code under the tabbed divider tables this table lists the prior code section

of the ordinance if the ordinance is codified the chapter or chapters will be indicated example 204 612 904 if the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified such as budgets taxes annexations or rezones the disposition will be special if the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code usually at the direction of the municipality the disposition will be not codified other dispositions sometimes used are tabled pending number not used or missing beginning with supplement no 35 this table will be replaced with the table and disposition list table and disposition list beginning with supplement no 35 a table and disposition list has been added for use in tracking legislative history located in the back of this volume this table is a chronological

dec 4 201 repealed the former ch 918   and enacted a new ch 918 as set out herein the former ch 918 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  part adopted 1994   purpose and findings the city council does hereby find that a it is the intent of council in enacting this chapter to recognize free speech rights for all citizens while at the same time protecting the coexistent rights for all citizens to enjoy safe and convenience travel in public spaces free from intimidating conducts threats and harassment that stem from certain types of abusive solicitation or that may give rise to interference with others activities if they occur in particular settings and contexts  b council finds that there are numerous forms of solicitation that are not in and of themselves inherently threatening or aggressive including vocal requests for a donation  carrying or displaying a sign requesting donations  shaking or jingling a cup of change  and ringing a bell in compliance with any applicable noise ordinance  and c however council finds that aggressive and intrusive solicitation threatens the security privacy and freedom of movement of both residents and visitors  and d council also finds that the presence of solicitors in certain specific areas such as near to or adjacent to automatic teller machines adjacent to sidewalk cafes open window cafes at public bus stops and in public garages in the nighttime create reasonable concerns by citizens objectively worried about their privacy freedom of movement and personal security  and e council further finds that certain forms of solicitation impede the orderly flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and leads to concerns regarding traffic and public safety including that of the solicitor particularly in congested roadways and sidewalks as defined below to include highly traveled areas lines to enter buildings historic districts with narrow sidewalks or on traffic medians or the obstructing of traffic on highspeed or highvolume streets and highways  and f this chapter is not intended impermissibly to limit an individuals right to exercise free speech associated with solicitation  rather it aims to impose specific time place and manner restrictions on solicitation and associated conduct in certain limited circumstances  namely limiting aggressive panhandling panhandling at locations or times deemed particularly threatening and dangerous and panhandling in places where people are a captive audience and there is a wish to avoid or reduce a threat of inescapable confrontations intimidation or over reaching  and g in promulgating this chapter council seeks to impose regulations that are narrowly tailored to serve the aforementioned significant governmental interests    definitions a aggressive begging panhandling or solicitation includes the following forms of conduct 1 confronting someone in a way that would cause a reasonable person to fear bodily harm  2 accosting an individual by approaching or speaking to the individual or individuals in such a manner as would cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon his or her person or upon property

directed has made a negative response either verbally by physical sign by attempting to leave the presence of the person soliciting or by other negative indication  b blocking the passage of the individual solicited  or c otherwise engaging in conduct that could reasonably be construed as intending to compel or force a person to accede to a solicitation 6 acting with the intent to intimidate someone into giving money  or 7 other conduct that a reasonable person being solicited would regard as threatening or intimidating in order to solicit a contribution or donation b areas with heightened personal security concerns include the following locations 1 areas within or within twenty feet of a public parking garage between dusk and dawn  2 areas within twenty feet of a public bus

political solicitation includes conduct that falls within the definition in subsection e of this section but only such conduct that involves requests for contributions presented in writing without speaking oral requests for contributions that do not constitute aggressive panhandling begging charitable or political solicitations or other activities that do not fall within the definition of

concerns are implicated accordingly passive panhandling begging charitable or political solicitation is expressly permitted as provided herein    aggressive panhandling begging charitable and

traffic corridors as identified in this chapter give rise to an increased risk of injury to solicitors on medians traffic congestion and traffic accidents that may affect drivers or solicitors 2 alternative sites this chapter provides ample alternative sites for passive begging panhandling charitable and political solicitation in areas that do not give rise to enhanced public safety concerns

especially dangerous in order to assure that these regulations are grounded in appropriate governmental concerns are narrowly tailored and allow alternative avenues for communication c prohibitions 1

corridor plan dated september 200 as may be amended from time to time this formbased code is also intended to encourage land uses that promote vibrant commerce social interaction and a wide variety of housing types where people can live work shop and play all within proximity and walking distance the intended goal of the formbased code is to create a complimentary extension of the downtown with its own unique character and design and to provide a framework for achieving the desired builtform characteristics of a downtown including similar densities building materials building orientation building heights architecture and a diversified mix of complimentary and interrelated land uses the formbased code consists of a regulating plan building envelope standards and design standards the code is comprised of five interrelated elements 1 zoning district narrative describing purpose intent applicability and design 2 a regulating plan that describes the areas within the development project where specified building types may be located 3 building envelope and street standards that describe the allowable height disposition and use for the specified building types and rightofway travel lane center median parking terrace andor sidewalk and alleyway width for the specified thoroughfares 4 design standards for guiding specific aspects of building and site design 5 the regulating plan and building envelope and street standards apply to new facilities such as buildings streets parking lots etc the design standards apply to existing and new facilities a design principles the code is based on several fundamental design principles 1 mixing of uses vertically within structures and horizontally upon sites allows for greater market flexibility sharing of support facilities such as parking reducing the necessity for short vehicle trips while promoting walking and biking and leading to a more sustainable city 2 buildings should be placed close to the sidewalk and street to better define and enliven the public realm and economize resources such as land and utilities 3 building types that support multiple uses and are flexible or adaptable over time are preferable to highly specific singleuse typologies that may more easily become obsolete 4 increased density helps afford increased private and public realm amenities such as brick and stone building exteriors and streetscaping 5 a more enhanced public realm with interconnected sidewalks plazas landscaped parkways and trails promotes and support social interaction and healthier living b using the regulating plan the regulating plan illustrates the proposed street and block layout for the old yellowstone district and south poplar street corridor and specifies new structures by building type permitted on each block the plan includes a typical representative photograph of each specific building type along with a corresponding legend indicating which building types are permitted in each of the four

vehicular and pedestrian traffic in parking facilities the enhancing of personal security and the deterring of vandalism while conserving energy and minimizing maintenance they provide minimum guidelines but are subject to variations based upon sound engineering judgment retailers especially bigbox stores usually prefer higher levels of illuminance than specified herein to attract customers or to more strongly address perceptions of personal security needs generally speaking parking lots and parking structures have vehicular speeds that are much lower than roadways more importantly the primary purpose of the lighting here is to benefit the pedestrian it is intended that a driver or pedestrian looking at the brightest spot in the field of view will also be able to detect an object in the dark areas within the field of view this detection can only occur if the maximumtominimum illuminance is limited to a range that the human eye can see table 1 recommended maintained illuminance values for parking enhanced security 2 minimum horizontal illuminance 3 lux 4 2 5 fc 2 02 05 uniformity ratio maximum to minimum 6   minimum vertical illuminance 7 lux 8 1 25 fc 5 01 025 1 for typical conditions during periods of nonuse the illuminance of certain parking facilities may be turned off of reduced to conserve energy if reduced lighting is to be used only for the purpose of property security it is desirable that the minimum low point value not be less than 10 horizontal lux 01 hfc reductions should not be applied to facilities subject to intermittent night use such as at apartments hospitals and transportation terminals 2 if personal security or vandalism is a likely andor severe problem a significant increase of the basic level may be appropriate many retailers prefer even higher levels with a specification of 10 lux 1 fc as the minimum value 3 for preliminary design an average value of 10 horizontal lux 1 hfc for basic or 25 horizontal lux 25 hfc for enhanced illuminance may be calculated the minimum points or areas and maximum point are then calculated and the uniformity ratio checked for compliance with the table 1 values note the  averagetominimum ratio is the first step toward directing the design to achieve the maximum to minimum ratios presented in table 1 4 measured on the parking surface without any shadowing effect from parked vehicles or trees at points of measurement 5 rounded conversion of lux to foot candles 6 the highest horizontal illuminance point divided by the lowest horizontal illuminance point or area should not be greater than the values shown 7 facial recognition can be made at levels a low as 25 lux 025 fc the tesna security lighting committee recommends that for facial identification the minimum vertical illuminance should be 50 lux 05 fc 8 measured at 15 meters 50 feet  above parking surface at the point of lowest horizontal illuminance excluding facing outward along boundaries basic lighting requirements tend to be similar for most land uses typical or average security needs are equally as great in a parking lot serving an apartment building or a regional shopping center in fact the higher the pedestrian activity level the lower the likely security problem however greater pedestrian activity usually equates to greater conflict with vehicles because these conditions tend to counterbalance no difference in the basic level of illuminance appears warranted among various land uses however customer attraction can be a reason to provide illuminance higher than the basic illuminance level given in table 1 when higher light levels are used retailers should give careful consideration to the safety consequences of drivers exiting the parking facility directly onto

use of land and conserve and protect the privacy and value of adjacent uses objectives the buffering alternatives are designed to meet the following objectives a to provide a smooth transition between adjoining properties  b to encourage developments compatible with existing developments  c to mitigate existing or potential conflicts between differing land uses definition buffering means the use of specific measures including screening which are designed to separate and protect differing land uses procedures buffering is required by this title for all multifamily dwellings adjacent to singlefamily dwellings and for all pud commercial industrial and multifamily developments adjacent to residential developments plans detailing buffering measures shall be included in the site plan application which shall be filed and processed according to the provisions of appendix a of this title compliance with approved buffering measures shall be enforced by the enforcement officer buffering alternatives recognizing that the amount and type of buffering necessary varies with each particular situation the following alternative measures are designed to provide the flexibility necessary for the maximum mitigation of conflicts between differing land uses a screening shall be required between the differing land uses as specified above and shall consist of one of the following 1 screening alternate 1 consists of a sixfoot solid wood fence or a masonry or concrete wall ten percent of the total screening surface may be composed of a openings each having a maximum area of twentyfour square inches or b materials other than masonry or concrete which may contain openings having a maximum dimension of nine inches in width or height  2 screening alternate 2 consists of a hedgerow of various evergreen shrubs which will normally grow to a height required to adequately buffer developments all plants should have a minimum height at the time of planting of onehalf of the required screening height  3 screening alternate 3 consists of a sixfoot solid wood fence or a concrete or masonry wall as specified in screening alternate 1 and evergreen trees such trees should be a minimum of two inches in trunk diameter at least five to six feet in height and planted ten to twelve feet on center  4 screening alternate 4 consists of landscaped earthen berms of a minimum height as needed to buffer developments side slopes of berms should have a minimum of four feet of horizontal distance for each one foot of height berms should contain necessary drainage provisions as required by the city  5 screening alternate 5 consists of large deciduous or coniferous trees such trees should be a minimum of two inches in trunk diameter fifteen feet in height and planted fifteen to twenty feet on center  6 screening alternate 6 consists of any combination of alternates 1 2 3 4 or 5 so as to provide screening adequate to buffer developments b in considering approval of a site plan assessment of the amount of screening required will be based upon the treatment of height bulk and density at the edge of the proposed development the following criteria should be considered in site design 1 open space setbacks by providing an open space buffer between conflicting land uses conflicts can often be avoided the width of the buffer required will depend on the extent of other measures applied to work effectively the purpose use and maintenance of the open space buffer must be clearly defined 2 orientation the strict spatial proximity between land uses and the apparent or functional proximity can be very different depending on the orientation of buildings and activities in the two land uses the buildings can create an effective buffer if constructed backtoback thus orienting views access and principal activities away from the other land use however a hazardous and unaesthetic no mans land must not be created in the process some appropriate use must be given to the intervening space alternately the intervening space can be eliminated altogether if the two buildings share a common back wall an entire site plan can be oriented so least compatible activities and functions are placed furthest from the common boundary between land uses and those most compatible near that boundary 3 architectural compatibility in addition to the architectural considerations involved in mitigation the materials colors scale and prominence of buildings in adjacent land uses can be coordinated so there is a gradual transition from one land use to another rather than a sharp and displeasing contrast the architectural compatibility should rise from a total consideration of the function of each land use and the function of the space between them 4 circulation streets and parking areas can often serve to reduce certain types of land use conflicts 5 onetoone ratio multifamily units constructed in the required setback can be only one story in height  for each additional ten feet of setback units may be constructed of one additional story up to the maximum height requirements of a district c buffering shall not 1 interfere with the installation maintenance and repair of any public utilities  2 restrict pedestrian or vehicular access  or 3 constitute a traffic hazard d examples of buffering techniques are shown on the following pages statutory references for
