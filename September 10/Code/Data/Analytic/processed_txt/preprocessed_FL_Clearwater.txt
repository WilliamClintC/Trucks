valuations to determine if the original 35 years of contributions by the city will still be necessary if the actuarial valuations indicate that a shorter time of funding is necessary to fund the amended benefits of the plan the city will have the option to either reduce the millage or shorten the number of years that contributions will be made should the city elect to do either of the above and at a later date it is determined by one of the actuarial valuations that the amount being contributed by the city will not properly fund the benefits provided by the plan the city shall increase its contributions to the maximum sixtenths of one mill or the adjusted rate thereof pursuant to the procedure set forth in this section because of an overall tax reassessment of property whichever is less for whatever period the deficit continues to exist if the actuarial valuation made after the first 10year period or any subsequent valuation indicates that the equivalent of sixtenths of one mill or the adjusted rate thereof pursuant to the procedure set forth in this section because of an overall tax reassessment of property whichever is less contributed by the city for the period of 35 years will not properly fund the amended benefits provided by the plan or if the funds on reserve at any time should become insufficient to pay the benefits provided by the plan then the city shall provide

definitions and rules of construction generally  102 liberal construction of division the provisions of this division being desirable for the welfare of the city and its inhabitants shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes set forth in this division 54 statement of policy and findings 1 it is the policy of the city to make it possible for the city to revitalize and preserve property values and prevent deterioration in the central business district by a system of selfhelp to correct the blight of such deterioration as has developed there it is a purpose of this division to provide the means whereby property owners within the district and benefiting directly from the result of such a program will bear the substantial cost thereof and therefore local problems may be solved on a local level 2 the city commission hereby declares that among the many causes of commercial blight in the downtown area are the following automobile traffic flow is impeded by outmoded street patterns a proliferation of uncoordinated uses and parking areas unsuitable topography faulty lot layouts fragmentation of land uses and parking areas necessitating frequent automobile movement lack of separation of vehicle traffic lanes railroad traffic and air pollution voluntary cooperation for coordinated development has limitations because of fragmentary ownership distant absentee ownership and unusual conditions of title and other conditions 3 the downtown area is plagued with vacant and deteriorating buildings which are neglected and produce a depressing atmosphere similarly there is much vacant land area in the downtown area and these factors tend to combine to put the downtown area at a competitive disadvantage to modern offices and shopping centers developing in the area these factors tend to develop an image of the downtown area which is unrepresentative of its economic vitality and outofplace with the growth of the city thus producing a tarnishing effect on the overall image of the city 4 the area now has few residences and many of the residences which do exist are of inferior construction which would not be permitted for new construction under the citys building code it is in some instances a proper function of government to remove blight and blighting influences from commercial areas the police power may be inadequate to accomplish this purpose one effective device for removal of the blight of the downtown area is the planning and implementation of planning for appropriate land use and beautification the continuity of planning and aesthetic and technical design concepts and the removal of deteriorated and obsolescent structures 5 responsibility for the planning and implementation in the downtown area as described in the preceding subsection 4 rests

the following represent policies of the city of clearwater as applied by the clearwater gas system a uniformity of rate and service application to the extent that the customer requests a review of hisher rate account all rates charges and contract provisions are intended to be consistently and uniformly applied to all customers of the same type with the same usage characteristics fuel options and equipment capabilities any customer who feels that they have been treated unjustly and is unable to resolve the dispute with clearwater gas system personnel and management has full access to the normal city of clearwater utilities dispute resolution process as defined in the city ordinances b contract rate level determination it is the policy of clearwater gas system to offer a customer or potential customer who currently uses or has access to an alternate energy source and has the capability to use this alternate energy source or is otherwise deemed to be a threat to discontinue gas usage a rate level adequate to acquire or preserve the gas load provided that such a rate application will provide a reasonable profit margin to the clearwater gas system and the extension of any capital investment to serve such a customer falls within the normal gas system construction feasibility formula where the capability to use such alternative energy source will require an initial additional capital outlay by the customer the contract rate may be based on a net present value calculation over the expected life of the facility c rate schedule reductions or minor changes the city manager is authorized to reduce the billing charges for any rate schedules or to make minor rate schedule modifications in keeping with achieving the cost of service based rates as recommended in the most recent rate study done for the clearwater gas system d main and service extension construction feasibility whenever a prospective customer requests a new gas service the clearwater gas system will extend service to the prospective customer under the following conditions 1 design considerations the extension of gas service to the perspective customer can be reasonably accomplished within good engineering design access can be secured though easements or rightofway and the service will not jeopardize the quality of gas service to existing customers 2 main line extension construction feasibility the maximum capital investment which will be made by the clearwater gas system to extend main lines and services to serve a new customers shall be seven times the estimated annual gas revenue to be derived from the facilities less the cost of gas and the cost of monthly meter reading customer accounting and billing the formula shall be nonfuel energy rate  estimated annual thermsgallons  estimated annual gas nonfuel revenues  7 years   maximum investment for construction feasibility note the monthly customer charge is not included in the above calculation because it is assumed to cover the cost of meter reading customer accounting and billing 3 service line extensions the clearwater gas system will install gas service lines off of the main line at no charge to the customer under the following circumstances a year round customer has installed year round gas equipment such as water heating cooking heating clothes drying and lighting with an estimated minimum annual consumption of two therms per foot of service line required note that leisure living appliance such as poolspa heating fireplaces and grills usage will only be counted at 12 of estimated usage and only if combined with a water heater or the cost of such service line extension meets the maximum investment for construction feasibility as defined d above excluding leisure living appliances

reasonable and uniform regulations that will protect the health safety and general welfare of the residents of the city the provisions hereof alone or together with the other applicable ordinances are not intended to have the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction upon the content of any communicative materials including adult materials it is not the intent of this division to restrict or deny access by adults to adult materials or expression protected by the first amendment or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of adult uses to their intended market nor shall this division be construed as having such effect rather it is the intent of this division to regulate the secondary effects of adult use establishments upon the public health safety and general welfare and to impose only incidental restrictions on first amendment freedoms which are no greater than are essential to the furtherance of such intent b legislative findings the city council finds and declares that 1 the findings set forth in the preamble to are incorporated herein by reference 2 the concerns raised in the findings incorporated by reference in subsection 1 raise substantial governmental concerns 3 adult use establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 4 requiring adult use establishments to obtain an adult use permit is an appropriate mechanism to ensure that the adult use establishment is operated in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the residents of the city and the public at large among other things it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the applicant is the actual owner or operator of the adult use establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and the activities occurring therein moreover because a substantial relationship exists between adult use establishments and the commission of sexually related crimes on the premises of those businesses a substantial justification exists for barring those individuals convicted of certain sexually related crimes from managing adult use establishments until a limited disqualification period has transpired in which those individuals have demonstrated that they are no longer criminally inclined to commit certain sexually related crimes 5 adult use establishments are a pervasively regulated industry making reasonable inspections and administrative searches necessary to enforce regulatory standards 6 removing doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting in adult theaters advances the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring at adult theaters 7 the prevention of sexual contact between patrons and employees at adult use establishments is unrelated to the suppression of free expression but serves to address the concerns raised in the finding contained herein 8 separating dancers from patrons and prohibiting dancers and patrons from engaging in sexual fondling and caressing in special cabarets would reduce the opportunity for prostitution and this should deter prostitution and the spread of communicable diseases and infestations although a dancers erotic message may be slightly less effective when viewed from the minimum distance prescribed herein the ability to engage in the protected expression is not significantly impaired 9 requiring that the facilities of adult theaters be constructed of materials that may be cleaned easily that the facilities be cleaned on a regular basis and that the employees cleaning facilities take reasonable precautions to avoid contact with possible diseasetransmitting media is reasonably related to the protection of both employees and patrons from sexually transmitted diseases 10 requiring operators of adult use establishments to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 11 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the adult use establishment is substantially related to the significant governmental interest of reducing or eliminating the criminal activity associated with adult use establishments 12 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases and in the investigation of criminal activity to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who either engage in the conduct that this ordinance is designated to prevent or are likely to be witnesses to such activity 13 although the weight of evidence shows that adult bookstores or video stores selling or renting only adult material and having no adult booththeater component have similar secondary effects as other adult uses such bookstores or video stores do not promote the transmission of sexual diseases on the premises therefore an exemption for such limited adult establishments from some of the requirements but not the locational requirements of this ordinance is appropriate 14 requiring adult use establishments to locate only in the irt district and on parcels of land with frontage on us 19 that are located in the us 19 districtcorridor subdistrict us 19c and prohibiting adult use establishments from locating within 400 feet of any residentially zoned property church school or public recreation area and within 750 feet of any other adult use establishment located within the city of clearwater will create a reasonable balance between the constitutionally mandated need to provide a sufficient area for adult uses to locate and the need for protecting public health safety and welfare as well as the need to reduce the blighting and downgrading effects that adult uses have on surrounding residential and commercial propertiesparticularly those commercial properties located on state road 60 which is the main route to clearwater beach 15 requiring adult uses establishments to locate in the us 19 districtcorridor subdistrict us 19c only on parcels of land with frontage on us 19 and prohibiting their location on state road 60 which is the main route to clearwater beach will provide adult use establishments with commercially desirable locations while contributing to the citys plan to beautify and revitalize state road 60 so that state road 60 will provide a more attractive corridor to clearwater beach thereby promoting tourism which is the main economic base c regulation of obscenity subject to state law it is not the intent of the city commission to legislate with respect to matters of obscenity these matters are regulated by state law including florida statutes d regulation of massage establishments subject to state law it is not the intent of the city commission to legislate with respect to matters of massage establishments these matters are regulated by the florida department of professional
