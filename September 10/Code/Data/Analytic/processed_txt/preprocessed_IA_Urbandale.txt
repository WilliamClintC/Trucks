cable customer service  11730 general provisions atitle this subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the cable customer service  bfurther findings and purpose 1the city of urbandale iowa city finds that the further development of cable communications may result in great benefits for the people of the city cable technology is rapidly changing and cable plays an essential role as part of the citys basic infrastructure cable television systems permanently occupy and extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rightsofway in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them and in a manner reserved primarily for those who provide essential services to the public subject to special public interest obligations such as utility companies the grant of a franchise has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic benefits and placing the holder in a position of public trust the city finds that public convenience safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the city or such persons as the city so designates to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest 2further it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the citys residents but can provide a variety of broadband interactive communications services to institutions and individuals many of these services involve city agencies and other public institutions cin light of the foregoing the following goals among others underlie

extent commercially practicable into existing system facilities 4a cable system should be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community and shall provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and service to the public 5a cable operator should pay fair compensation to the city for the occupation and use of scarce and valuable local public rightsofway dthe city intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes and that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter be construed to include

findings and intent athis chapter may be referred to as the parks and open space or parkland or parkland herein referred to as code chapter or parkland ordinance and is adopted pursuant to the provisions of iowa b 354 and 414 and any and all other relevant chapters or provisions of the iowa bin accordance with its comprehensive plan and to implement the plan the city has adopted a zoning ordinance to regulate the use of land size and configuration of land parcels  height and bulk of buildings  locations and uses of buildings and structures  size of yards and open spaces  density of population  and other matters to lessen congestion in the streets  secure safety from fire flood panic and other dangers  promote public health and general welfare  provide adequate light and air  protect life and property from flooding  prevent the overcrowding of land and avoid undue concentrations of population  facilitate the provision of adequate streets pedestrianways water sewerage drainage schools parks and other public needs  preserve the natural environment and the character of the city and its neighborhoods  and to conserve property values throughout the city c1the development of land must be regulated to ensure that new developments conform to and implement the citys comprehensive plan and the purposes of its zoning ordinance the city council has therefore adopted subdivision and site plan ordinances to prescribe minimum standards that are intended to ensure that new developments are properly designed in accordance with professional standards and properly improved to provide all of the new and additional facilities and infrastructure that will benefit and be needed by the new residents and occupants of such developments 2the subdivision ordinance also is an expression of the city councils intent to have the costs for said new facilities and infrastructure to be equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional needs that are created by each new development so new developments will not usurp the existing services and infrastructure that have been provided for and financed by existing taxpayers or necessitate the expenditure of public funds collected from existing resident taxpayers to provide additional facilities and infrastructure that benefit the residents and occupants of new developments deach and every existing public facility and piece of infrastructure has a finite capacity whether it be a sewer water main street fire station school playground or other recreational facility park open space area floodplain treatment plant or other facility or infrastructure through the virtues of sound planning and continual investment the citys existing resident taxpayers have customarily provided significantly more than the minimum capacities that are required by the existing population of resident taxpayers in order to assure the publics health and safety and freedom from threat or crisis  provide a high level of public services for their personal benefit  and to attain and maintain a high quality of life for their personal benefit ethe city has found preparation and adoption of its comprehensive plan and its parks and open space plan that the needs of its existing resident taxpayers for public parks and open spaces have been met and continue to be met due its considerable and ongoing annual investments in improvements maintenance upkeep and repairs and operations of its existing public parks and open space system fnew residential developments are being added within the city and many new homes are being erected and occupied annually within the new developments it is generally understood and accepted that the new streets sewers water mains sidewalks and other facilities and infrastructure that adjoin each lot within a new development directly benefit and increase the value of the lot the new streets et al would not be needed if not for the creation of and subsequent building on and occupancy of said lots and the lots could not be built upon occupied and used if such new facilities and infrastructure were not constructed in conjunction with and as part of the new development accordingly it is found to be reasonable and proper for the developers of new developments to bear the full costs for such new facilities and infrastructure and the developers are expected to pass such full costs passed on to the purchasers and occupants of the lots in the new developments as part of the lots purchase price gdevelopers and the purchasersoccupants of lots in new developments are less cognizant of and may be unwilling to recognize or acknowledge the full benefits and increased value that the new developments derive from the service capacities being provided by existing public facilities and infrastructure that may not be located within or near a new development and that may not exclusively serve a single new development each new development generates new users and each new user consumes a portion of the existing capacities of such offsite facilities and infrastructure at a rate that usually is at least commensurate to that of the existing resident taxpayers any single new user will not overwhelm the existing capacity of any of the citys offsite facilities and infrastructure and cause catastrophic failure especially given that more than the minimum capacities required by the existing resident taxpayers has been created and maintained by said existing resident taxpayers for their personal benefit and quality of life nonetheless each new user of existing facilities and infrastructure does usurp existing service capacity and infrastructure that had been provided for and financed by existing resident taxpayers for their own benefit and enjoyment and thereby deprives the existing resident taxpayers of benefits they had paid for and previously enjoyed h1as new developments continue to be created eventually any and all available capacity of the existing offsite facilities and infrastructure will be usurped by the purchasers and occupants of the new developments although additional facilities and capacities may not become necessary solely because of the added use by any one new user or development they do become necessary because of the cumulative effect of numerous additional users generated by a progression of new developments over an indefinite period of time additional facilities and expansions of infrastructure capacities inevitably become necessary to restore the level of benefits previously enjoyed by existing resident taxpayers said additional facilities and capacities would not be necessary if not for the new residents and occupants of new developments 2therefore the city council finds that it is found to be fair reasonable and appropriate for each and every developer of each and every new development to bear the fair share of the costs for new offsite facilities and additional infrastructure capacities that are or will be made necessary by the purchasersoccupants of each and every new development  for the costs of maintaining or restoring the previously existing benefits that are usurped from existing resident taxpayers to be fully accounted for in the sales prices of parcels in the new development  and for such new facilities and infrastructure to be added without creating costs or other burdens of any kind on the existing resident taxpayers the city council also finds that it is appropriate for such infrastructure capacity to be provided as part of and in conjunction with the design and improvement of each new development when it is created to replace the existing capacity that has been or will be consumed as soon as possible in order to minimize the burden and inconvenience that new developments impose on existing resident taxpayers ias with all other existing public facilities and infrastructure existing public parks and open spaces have a finite capacity that is usurped by the occupants of new residential developments and that create needs for additional public open space and parks both land for such facilities and for park infrastructure improvements thereto therefore the city council finds it reasonable and appropriate for additional public park and open space facilities and capacities to be provided by each and every new development in the same manner that other public infrastructure is required to be provided in new developments by the subdivision and site plan ordinances in order to maintain the existing adequate level of public open space and park facilities within the city and to prevent the residents of new developments from usurping existing public parks and open spaces from resident taxpayers jthe acquisition of land that is suited for use as public parks and open space of sufficient size shape character and location is the mostcritical goal that must be achieved in order to provide an adequate supply of appropriate public neighborhood parks and open spaces that can meet the residents of new developments and mitigate their impacts on existing facilities and lands such land should primarily be within or in close proximity to the new residential developments that they are intended to serve while remaining mindful to the suitability of the available land and to the ability to provide more and better recreational opportunities on a single larger parcel of land than on two or more smaller parcels of the same cumulative area once sufficient land has been obtained the next goal will be the construction or installation of improvements to the new park or open space that will fulfill the most basic recreational and park needs of a broad spectrum of new users of all ages and abilities while at the same time showing a bias towards serving youthful new users in most cases kthis chapter is not intended to repeal abrogate annul impair or interfere with any existing

is suited for use as an active recreation area  primarily suited for passive recreation or greenbelt  and land that is deemed undevelopable or impractical to develop by reason of natural conditions  shape or size  or economic factors and that accordingly may be suitable only or primarily for use as a public greenbelt or other open space uses if the city council deems that the dedication is acceptable and satisfies the requirements of this chapter 2alternatively a developer may request that the minimum amount of land that is to be dedicated to satisfy the requirements of this chapter be calculated in accordance with the following athe residential development shall dedicate an active recreation area that is not less than five acres in size together with an additional land dedication of two and onehalf acres that is suitable for use as either an active or passive recreation area as defined by this chapter for each 1000 of population that is forecast to live within the completed development at the time of its initial occupancy the forecast population shall be calculated in accordance with the following division a2b below bthe city council hereby finds and affirms that the average household size is significantly greater in new residential developments than it is in established mature neighborhoods for reasons that include but are not limited to the socioeconomic characteristics of homebuying households historically household sizes have been found to decline as the residential development ages over decades to become smaller than the city average and then increase moderately to approximate the average household size by the time that the household sizes have declined to match or be less than the city average the original park infrastructure will have exceeded its life expectancy and will be replaced by new infrastructure funded by public tax revenues but at all times all land dedicated in accordance with this chapter will continue to be needed and necessary for park purposes as set forth in this chapter therefore the population that is forecast to live within the completed development at the time of its initial occupancy shall be determined by multiplying the average household size as enumerated in the mostrecent decennial census or other census count for the city for which all necessary data is available within a census tract or multiple census blocks containing the greatest percentage of housing units that were constructed during the decade immediately preceding the mostrecent census such tract or blocks shall be selected and analyzed according to housing type and average household sizes determined for each housing type from said census information such average household sizes shall then be multiplied by the number of housing units of each type that are proposed in the new development to determine the forecast populations by housing type in the new development at the time of its initial occupancy the forecast populations of each housing type shall then be added together to derive the total forecast population for the new residential development to be used in the formula described in division a2a above c1for the 2010 census the following average household sizes shall be used for the calculations of this section asinglefamily detached dwelling unit 349 personsoccupied unit  bsinglefamily attached dwelling unit 192 personsoccupied unit  and cmultifamily dwelling unit 197 personsoccupied unit 2the average household sizes that are listed herein shall be updated to reflect the enumerations of future decennial censuses or other census counts as such data becomes available bas an option to the two methods set forth in division a above a developer may submit an alternative proposal that fully complies with the intent and purposes and of this chapter but may not fully comply with the methods of calculation that is set forth in division a above the developer shall have the burden of demonstrating and proving that the alternative proposal meets or exceeds this chapters prescribed methods of compliance any such proposal shall be first reviewed by city staff and a report made to the parks and recreation commission which shall provide a recommendation for action on the proposal to the city council cthe location and configuration of land that is to be dedicated to satisfy the minimum requirements of this chapter shall be compliant with the citys comprehensive plan and parks and open space plan as may be determined and approved by the city council the city may require that land that is to be dedicated under this chapter be located and configured to allow the dedications of two or more developments present or future to be aggregated to form a single large park dedication parcel since larger recreation areas usually allow more and better park facilities to be provided dland that is intended to provide required storm water detention or retention shall not be credited towards satisfying any of the park land dedication requirements of this chapter unless it is graded and improved in a manner that makes it satisfactory and suited for use as an active recreation area land or area that is required to be provided as a buffer yard or to satisfy minimum onsite landscaped open space requirements of by the zoning subdivision or site planning codes shall not be counted towards satisfying the requirements of this chapter eland dedications shall be conveyed to the city by a properly executed warranty deed without cost to the city prior to the recording of a final subdivision plat or plat of survey or in the case of a site plan prior to the issuance of any building permits  15606 park infrastructure improvements in lieu of land dedication a1if the city council determines that a dedication of land is not feasible or practical within a new development the developer shall construct or install park infrastructure improvements that are equal in value to that of the minimum land dedication had a land dedication been accepted within an existing or proposed city park that can serve the new development 2in all cases where the city council determines and directs that park infrastructure is to constructed or provided in lieu of a land dedication whether all or in part the minimum value of the park infrastructure that is to be provided shall be determined in the following manner athe council shall first determine the amount of land that would be required to be dedicated in accordance with  15605a1 bthe cash value of said land dedication shall be determined by multiplying the total purchase price or cost of all the land in the proposed development by 10%  provided that the total purchase price or cost is the current fair and reasonable value of the entire property if the total purchase price does not reflect the current fair and reasonable value of the land the fair value of said land shall be determined by an impartial appraisal and in such manner as may be designated by the city council cost for said appraisal to be shared equally between developer and city ba developer may voluntarily choose to pay a fee to the city in the amount determined under this section in lieu of constructing park infrastructure any such fee shall be deposited and used only in full accord with  15608 cif park infrastructure is being provided in lieu of a land dedication it shall be completed prior to the recording of the final plat or in the case of a site plan prior to the issuance of any building permits unless surety is provided in favor of the city to guarantee that the park infrastructure will be installed at a later date if a fee is voluntarily given in lieu of a dedication or construction of park infrastructure it shall be deposited with the city prior to the recording of a plat or issuance of any building permits  15607 parkland development and maintenance athe city shall be responsible for the development and maintenance of land and park infrastructure that has been dedicated to satisfy the requirements of this chapter for its perpetual use by and availability to the public recreational purposes or open space the city council shall have the sole discretion and authority to determine the specific manner and extent of such public utilization and access commensurate with the character and composition of such land and its natural resources bthe developer shall not be responsible for its maintenance or any liability thereon except for any ground water contamination or hazard that was caused or knowingly allowed to exist by said person  15608 separate account aany fees or other funds that are collected by the city for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of this chapter shall be deposited in a separate account and shall be used only to acquire or develop new public parks open spaces or park infrastructure that mostdirectly benefits the residential development from which the funds were obtained and as shall be approved ordered and directed by the city council the city council may at its sole discretion request or direct the parks and recreation commission to make a recommendation for the expenditure of said funds bany and all interest accumulated from such funds shall accrue to the separate account and shall be used only for acquisition and development of public parks and open spaces in the same manner as the funds that generated the interest to the extent practical but in all cases to provide additional public parks open space and park infrastructure that will serve and benefit the residents of the developments that provided such funds cno such funds or accumulated interest shall be used to replace repair or maintain any park infrastructure that exists or did exist at any prior time unless the city council finds that the previously existing infrastructure was replaced by other infrastructure that remains in place and in good condition or otherwise finds that expenditure of such funds or interest to reestablish the previously existing infrastructure does in fact thereby constitute and provide new and additional recreational opportunities and services to the residents of a new development from which such funds or interest were generated  15609 exception for private common recreational facilities in lieu of dedicating public land or providing public park infrastructure private common parks open spaces and park infrastructure may be dedicated to and owned by a homeowners association or like entity if such land and infrastructure completely meet the needs of the residents it is intended to serve and satisfies all of the requirements of this chapter such land and improvements shall be permanently reserved held and maintained for the park open space and

typically will include a food supermarket as the principal tenant and other establishments supplying commodities or performing personal services for the daily living needs of the residents of the neighborhood 2it is not intended that any area be mapped of such size as to allow all or a substantial number of the permitted uses to locate within it but rather to establish a range of individual uses which supply appropriate commodities and services and thereby provide an opportunity to create a suitable mix of specialty shops which will facilitate the economic success of the shopping area

and format set forth in said checklist and shall at a minimum include the following 1sufficient information about adjacent properties and improvements thereto to indicate relationships to the proposed development including such information as property lines pedestrian and vehicular circulation significant natural features or physical improvements and existing and proposed public infrastructure  2general locations of proposed land uses and significant structures and common open space and recreational facilities  delineating areas with different uses or building types and lot sizes gross density per acre or floor area ratios as appropriate to the proposed development  3general location and size of areas to be dedicated or reserved for common open space and parks schools and similar uses  4existing and proposed circulation systems including proposed arterial and collector streets major points of access  pedestrianways and in the case of nonresidential developments offstreet parking and loading areas and truck circulation and travel routes  5existing and proposed sanitary and storm sewer systems water mains and drainageways in a conceptual nature  6proposed bulk

computations in accordance with the criteria of the applicable sanitary sewer district  8proposed mitigation along the perimeter of the project for protection of adjoining properties such as larger setbacks and buffer yards landscaping walls fences or other screening height limitations architectural or site design or other provisions  9a narrative or graphical explanation of how the unified planning and design concepts objectives and alternative criteria proposed by the planned unit development make certain conventional controls and regulations unnecessary  will result in a development that is superior to that which could reasonably result from conventional controls and regulations as measured by public welfare and benefit  or are necessary due to unique conditions or characteristics of the property such explanation should describe the character of the proposed development in a way that can be understood by the lay person  the rationale behind the assumptions choices and designs that are the basis for the proposed unified plans  the compatibility with the surrounding area  and design considerations for architecture engineering landscaping open space and so forth  10proposed phasing and timetable athe director may require any additional information which may be needed to evaluate the proposed pud or may waive some submittal items if they do not appear to be necessary or relevant to the situation bthe above information should be shown in a clear and logical manner in a legible scale generally existing conditions should be illustrated on a separate sheet for sake of clarity although existing topography access utility and sewer lines and other items that are appropriate for understanding the proposal should also appear on the proposed development plan it is strongly recommended that an architect landscape architect and civil engineer be employed to prepare the plans edevelopment controls although puds are intended to promote and permit flexibility of design and thereby may involve modifications of conventional regulations or standards certain requirements which are set forth below shall be applied to ensure that the development is compatible with the intent of this 1only those uses that are approved and made a part of the master plan and subject to any conditions attached thereto shall be permitted 2height setback bulk and other requirements set out in the master plan shall constitute the basis for and become the zoning requirements  provided that refinements may be made plan approval if not defined as a substantial modification  in lack of any special provisions set out in the master plan the requirements of the most proximate zoning district as defined by use shall be applied  communication towers may be allowed on nonresidential properties as either a permitted or conditional use in accordance with the regulations for the district which the pud most closely approximates as determined by the uses permitted and strictly construed to be a conditional use under the more restrictive district in the event of any question as to applicable regulations 3project phases shall be substantially and functionally selfcontained and selfsustaining with regard to access parking utilities required open space screening and transitional elements and other support features and be capable of supporting required operation and maintenance activities  temporary provisions such as turnarounds or access easements may be required for this purpose  the initial phases generally should not be comprised of the most intensive portions of the pud unless the city concurs this is the most feasible means of developing the property in terms of access sewer service or similar physical constraints or will permit earlier development of common amenities 4attention shall be given to mitigation of existing or potential land use conflicts orientation open space setbacks landscaping and screening grading traffic circulation and architectural compatibility it is the intent of this recognize that appropriate use of design techniques will provide the required mitigation and thereby eliminate the need for certain conventional regulations or standards as examples and not requirements orienting views access and principal activities away from the land use needing protection placing those least compatible activities farthest from the common boundary and those most compatible nearest can create an effective buffer  setbacks in conjunction with landscaping can mitigate conflicts by providing a visual buffer controlling pedestrian access softening visual contrast by subduing the differences in architecture and bulk and reducing heat and dense landscaping can reduce the width of physical separation needed for such purposes  proper grading will control drainage can alter views and subdue sound and channel access  fences walls and berms will channel access and control visual sound and light pollution  proper architectural use of color bulk materials and shape will enhance compatibility and reduce contrast although details added to the building for aesthetic purpose without consideration to form and surroundings may be detrimental rather than helpful  and proper design of pedestrianways streets and points of access and proper location of parking areas will reduce congestion and safety hazards and help prevent introduction of noise pollutants and other conflicts into areas with less intensive land use other techniques may also be used 5there shall be a minimum setback of 20 feet for any garage whose vehicular access faces the street 6permanent care and maintenance of open space recreation amenities and other common elements shall be provided in a legally binding form if the
