chapter shall be known as the newtown township stormwater management  or interchangeably stormwater management of the the township of newtown  1432 statement of findings a inadequate management of increased rate and volume of stormwater runoff from land development increases stream flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities upsets the hydrologic cycle particularly the reduced infiltration and threatens public health safety and welfare b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff can harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens c groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d a comprehensive program of stormwater management including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the environment e stormwater is an important natural resource that replenishes groundwater supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality f negative effects of stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality infiltration stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most costeffective and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is project design that minimizes impervious surfaces and sprawl avoids sensitive areas ie stream buffers floodplains steep slopes and considers topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime g public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component of successful stormwater management  1431 general provisions  1432   1433 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within newtown township by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and minimizing the impacts described herein designed to h federal and state regulations require certain municipalities including newtown township to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4s under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes i nonstormwater discharges to a municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by newtown township a promote alternative land development and building construction designs and layouts that minimize the negative impacts on surface and groundwater from stormwater b promote nonstructural best management practices bmps for stormwater management c minimize increases in stormwater runoff volume d minimize impervious surfaces that encourage stormwater runoff e manage rate and volume of stormwater runoff erosion and sedimentation and infiltration of stormwater at its source by regulating activities that cause stormwater runoff problems f provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management g utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems as much as possible h manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source on natural drainage processes and discouragement of structural control measures i focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain stream base flow to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources j protect steam base flows and quality of streams and watercourses k meet legal water quality requirements under federal and state law including regulations at 25 pa 4a requiring protection and maintenance of existing uses and maintenance of the level of water quality to support those uses in all streams and the protection and maintenance of water quality in special protection streams  1432 newtown code  1433   1434 statutory authority newtown township is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect stormwater runoff and surface

intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn m according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts n sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities o numerous

legislature of the commonwealth of pennsylvania has by the passage of the pennsylvania flood plain management act of 197 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to promote public health safety and the general welfare of its citizenry b certain areas of newtown township are floodplain areas subject to periodic flooding from watercourses or inadequate drainage wet soils or soils having a highwater table which flooding results in loss of property danger to life damage to structures injury to people disruption of public and private activities and services burdensome public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare c flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplain areas causing increases in flood heights and velocities and the occupancy of floodplain areas by uses vulnerable to floods d certain sections of newtown township are aquifer recharge areas which form the source of the underground water supply and are especially sensitive to pollution and contamination from inappropriate surface uses e drainage areas wet soils or soils having a highwater table and water courses located in newtown township are part of integrated drainage basins and as such the construction or other alteration of land within the township that increases runoff also increases the flood hazard to communities downstream a it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize flood losses b the specific intent of this article is 1 to promote the general health safety and welfare of the community 2 to regulate or prevent the erection of
