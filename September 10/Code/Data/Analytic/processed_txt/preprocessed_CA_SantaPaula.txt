and industrial waste discharged directly or indirectly into the sewer system of the city 1the highest and best use of the city sewer system is the collection treatment and reclamation or disposal of

discharge limitations  3the city is committed to a policy of wastewater renovation and reuse in order to provide an alternate source of water supply and to reduce overall costs of wastewater treatment and disposal the renovation of wastewater treatment processes may necessitate more stringent quality requirements on industrial waste discharges as the demand for reclaimed water increases  4optimum use of city facilities may require the discharge of waste waters during periods of low flow in the sewer system as established by the director  5provisions are made in this chapter to regulate industrial waste discharges to comply with the state and federal government requirements and policies and to meet increasingly higher standards of treatment plant effluent quality and environmental

and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss 81  passed  88  15103 statement of purpose this chapter is intended to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed ato protect human life and health  bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dto minimize prolonged business interruptions  eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  gto ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and hto ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard

reference mobile homes see cal health & safety et seq rent stabilization  15201 purpose athe conditions which caused the city to adopt previous ordinances of the municipal code regulating rent increased for spaces in mobile home parks continue to exist mobile home owners unlike apartment tenants or residents of other rental stock are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment in a mobile home for which they must rent a space in a mobile home park many have also made investments in landscaping and exterior improvements to the mobile home and the rental space on which it is located alternative sites for the relocation of mobile homes are difficult to find due to the shortage of vacant spaces the restriction on the age size or style of mobile homes permitted in many parks and requirements related to the installation of mobile homes including permits landscaping and site preparation thus if mobile home owners are unable to pay the rent or relocate for other reasons they must sell their homes excessive rents or uncertainty as to the rent impairs the ability to sell a mobile home and recover the investment as well as fair return on the homeowners investment in the mobile home at the present time the cost of moving a mobile home is $10000 or more and the risk of damage in moving is significant typically mobile homes may not be moved more than once in their lifetime the creation of mobile home parks and mobile home park spaces require approvals and permits by local government neither the city nor any other local political entities in the county have approved the creation of any new mobile home parks or a substantial number of new spaces in many years in fact since 1985 a number of mobile home parks in the county have closed resulting in a dwindling number of mobile home park spaces in the county available for rent the result of these conditions is the creation of a captive market of mobile home owners and tenants consequently the rental of spaces by mobile home park owners to mobile home residents is a noncompetitive business venture in which in the absence of price regulation price gouging is likely to and has occurred also the immobility of mobile homes and the shortage of spaces in turn contributes to the imbalance in the bargaining relationship between park owners and mobile home park tenants because mobile homes are often owned by senior citizens persons on fixed incomes and persons of low and moderate income exorbitant rent increases fall upon these individuals with particular harshness bit is the purpose of this subchapter to protect residents of mobile home parks from excessive rent increases to regulate the size of an allowable space rent increase upon the vacation either by sale or otherwise of a resident from a mobile home space in a park while at the same time providing a just and reasonable return to park owners cprevious ordinances enacted by the city council have not been sufficiently protective in terms of the conditions described above this has resulted in a lack of uniformity in terms of space rent increases as between mobile home parks lack of a clear standard in determining fair return to the park owner and price gouging on increasing rents when a resident vacates the space by sale or otherwise 81   15202 definitions for the purpose of this subchapter the following
