impact dnotice of violation nov generally issued by the inspectorfield personnel the notice of violation nov is an official communication from the department to the noncompliant user that informs the user that the pretreatment violation has occurred the nov is issued for relatively minor or infrequent violations of pretreatment standards and requirements and should be issued within five working days of the identification of a violation a nov does not contain assessment of penalties or cost recovery the nov provides the user with an opportunity to correct the noncompliance on its own initiative rather than according to a schedule of actions determined by the department the nov documents the initial attempts of the department to resolve the non compliance authenticated copies of novs may serve as evidence in judicial proceedings eschedule of compliance a schedule of compliance is a detailed list of the steps to be taken by a noncompliant industry whereby compliance with all pretreatment regulations will be achieved this schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards eg hiring an engineer completing preliminary plans executing contracts for components commencing construction and the like fadministrative penalties an administrative penalty is a monetary penalty assessed by the department for violations of pretreatment standards and requirements administrative penalties are to be used as an escalated enforcement action and are punitive in nature and are not related to a specific cost born by the department instead the amount of the penalty should recapture any economic benefit gained by noncompliance andor deter future violations an administrative order is to be used to assess an administrative penalty gadministrative orders administrative orders ao are to be issued by the industrial waste coordinator or the director administrative orders are enforcement documents that direct users to undertake andor to cease specified activities administrative orders are to be used as the first formal response to significant noncompliance and may incorporate compliance schedules administrative penalties assessments for costs incurred during investigation andor enforcement attorneys fees assessments for damages and termination of service the department has adopted four general types of aos compliance orders show cause orders cease and desist orders and agreed orders 1compliance order a compliance order directs the user to achieve or restore compliance by a specified date and is the primary means of assessing penalties and costs the compliance order will document the noncompliance and state required actions to be accomplished by specific dates and is issued by the director 2show cause order an order to

for etowah tennessee title regulations controlling the subdivision of land in etowah tennessee and its planning region requiring and regulating the preparation and presentation of preliminary and final design standards  requiring minimum improvements to be made or guaranteed to be made by the subdivider  setting forth the procedure to be followed by the planning commission in applying these rules regulations and standards  and prescribing penalties for the violation of its provisions purpose land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development once land has been cut up into streets lots and blocks and publicly recorded the correction of defects is costly and difficult subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided the welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects it is therefore in the interest of the public the developer and the future owner that subdivisions be conceived designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards & ii  page i1 article i

law and such standards as are adopted by the mcminn county commission road added  a way for vehicular traffic whether designated as an avenue arterial collector boulevard road highway expressway lane alley or other way and for the purpose of these regulations roads are divided into the following categories 1 rural principal arterials  the rural principal arterial system consists of a connected rural network of continuous routes having the following characteristics a serve corridor movements having trip length and travel density characteristics indicative of substantial statewide or interstate travel b serve all or virtually all urban areas of 50000 and over population and a large majority of those with population of 25000 and over road types etowah s ubdivision regulations  iii  5 etowah s ubdivision regulations  iii  6 c provide an integrated network without stub connections except where unusual geographic or traffic flow conditions dictate otherwise eg international boundary connections and connections to coastal cities in the more densely populated states this system of highway may not include all heavily traveled routes which are multilane facilities it is likely however that in the majority of states the principal arterial system will include all existing rural freeways 2 rural minor arterials  the rural minor arterial road system should in conjunction with the principal arterial system form a rural network having the following characteristics a link cities and larger towns and other traffic generators such as major resort areas that are capable of attracting travel over similarly long distances and form an integrated network providing interstate and intercounty service b be spaced at such intervals consistent with population density so that all developed areas of the state are within a reasonable distance of an arterial highway c provide an integrated network without stub connections except where unusual geographic or traffic flow conditions dictate otherwise eg international boundary connections and connections to coastal cities 3 collectors  the rural collector routes generally serve travel of primarily intracounty rather than statewide importance and constitute those routes on which regardless of traffic volume predominant travel distances are shorter than on arterial routes consequently more moderate speeds may be typical on the average in order to define more clearly the characteristics of rural collectors this system should be subclassified according to the following criteria a rural major collector these routes should 1 provide service to any county seat not on an arterial route to the larger towns not directly served by the higher systems and to other traffic generators of equivalent intracounty importance such as consolidated schools shipping points county parks important mining and agricultural areas etc   2 link these places with nearby larger towns or cities or with routes of higher classification  and 3 serve the more important intracounty travel corridors b rural minor collectors etowah s ubdivision regulations  iii  7 these routes should 1 be spaced at intervals consistent with population density to collect traffic from local roads and bring all developed areas within a reasonable distance of a collector road  2 provide service to the remaining smaller communities  and 3 link the locally important traffic generators with their rural hinterland 4 local streets neighborhood  the purpose of a local street is to provide access to property abutting the public rightofway this includes vehicular and pedestrian access local streets are included in the rural local road system the rural local road system should have the following characteristics 1 serve primarily to provide access to adjacent land  and 2 provide service to travel over relatively short distances as compared to collectors or other higher systems local roads will of course constitute the rural mileage not classified as part of the principal arterial minor arterial or collector systems 5 marginal access street  marginal access streets are minor streets which are parallel to and adjacent to arterial streets and highways  and which provide access to abutting properties and protection from  alley  a minor street used for service access to the back or side of properties otherwise abutting on a street 7 culdesac  a local street with only one outlet called a deadend street setback line a line established by zoning ordinance or subdivision regulations generally parallel with and measured from the lot lines

____________________________________________________________________________________________ subdivision regulations for etowah tennessee ____________________________________________________________________________________________ as prepared by the etowah regional planning commission jim alsip chairman chris watts vicechairman leroy hershey evan ray burke garwood gene keller don rogers  as amended  originally adopted  answers to questions often asked about subdivision regulations 1 are subdivision regulations fair to everyone yes the written regulations provide the local planning commissions with uniform procedures and standards of design and construction by which to appraise equally and fairly all plats for land subdivision 2 who is affected by the regulations every owner of land within the planning region who divides land into smaller parcels or changes the size or shape of existing lots 3 am i affected if i resubdivide my tract into two parcels yes in most cases subdivision means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots sites or divisions for immediate or future sale or building development and includes resubdivision see definition in  4 whats to prevent me from recording a subdivision plat without approval the county register of deeds is prevented by law from recording land subdivisions lying within planning regions without final planning commission approval in writing 5 can i sell by an unapproved plat and then record my lots by metes and bounds no state law makes it a misdemeanor punishable by law to use an unapproved subdivision plat even if metes and bounds description is used in the instrument of transfer or sale 6 what happens if i sell unapproved and unrecorded lots from my subdivision a a state law has been broken tca 133410 b most lending agencies will not approve or guarantee loans c state law requires that public bodies shall not extend sewers water mains lighting or other utilities in unauthorized roads d where building permits or zoning are in effect a building permit to construct any building will be withheld e any building or structure erected in violation may be forced to be vacated or removed f the legislative body of a county or municipality may stop sales by injunction or other legal action 7 what improvements will i need to install in my subdivision most subdivision regulations require the developer to grade and improve roads install curbs monuments sewers and water mains in accordance with adopted specifications 8 why doesnt the lot buyer instead of the developer pay for improvements the lot buyer does  at the time he purchases his property if lots are sold without regulations often the community bears the expense of providing needed improvements that should have been originally planned for and installed by the developer 9 wont subdivision regulations cause expensive development and cost me a lot of money quite the contrary properly planned subdivisions make the most of land with a minimum of construction and operating cost good design takes advantage of all capabilities of the site and results in a minimum amount of roads and utilities with a maximum number of wellarranged and easiersold lots good land subdivision affects the value of the land and the immediate return to the investor while saving the developer money l0 how do i go about having a subdivision approved your local planning commissions printed set of regulations include the procedure for having a plat approved the planning commission meets at regular intervals and your preliminary plat is submitted in advance of the meeting at which it is to be considered it is suggested that you consult your planning commission early so as to become familiar with the official plans that might affect your area ll what if i wish to lay out a commercial or industrial subdivision the provisions of subdivision regulations apply to all subdivision of land including that for use of business and industry since space parking and service requirements will vary greatly it is impossible to establish standards for all types of uses for that reason specific requirements for lot sizes and area are set forth in detail only for residential areas l2 where can i get technical site planning assistance your planning commission will help by recommending several competent subdivision designers who can contribute much to the financial success of your subdivision although they will not prepare final plans for you advice on layout and design is available from the planning staff of the local planning office of the tennessee department of economic and community development suggested steps for a developer of a subdivision  confer with the planning commission and its staff representatives to become thoroughly familiar with the subdivision requirements the major street plan and other public improvements which might affect the area to be subdivided  have preliminary sketch plat prepared by a reputable engineer or surveyor  discuss preliminary plat with staff representative the preapplication review by a trained land planner may save the subdivider time and costly revisions as well as possible savings design  submit required copies of the sketch plat to the planning commission for preliminary approval in advance of its regular monthly meeting when preliminary approval has been granted  see city engineer or designated approving agents for street and utility specifications  contact city or county health officials for septic tank specifications if public sewers are not available  develop subdivision according to preliminary plat and required modifications if any install improvements  obtain certificates from street and
