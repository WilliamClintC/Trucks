park minimum 312 acres 10 d districtwide park or playfield minimum 4 acres up to 30 acres 125 e community wide recreation park minimum 12 acres up to 30 acres 20 55 acres total of land per 1000 people 2 location a park site of not less than five 5 acres shall be required adjoining each elementary school site a central location which will serve equally the entire development is most desirable in large developments these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances 3 credit for private open spaces and recreation areas when subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services depending upon the size of the development a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may at the option of the president and board of trustees be provided in the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space the extent of same shall be determined by the president and board of trustees based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreational land for the general area in general a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation detailed plans of such areas including specifications of facilities to be installed must be approved by the village and before any credit is given for private recreation areas the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents private swimming clubs are included in this provision when an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given b criteria for requiring school site dedication 1 requirement and population ratio the ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites the land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of a estimated number of children to be generated from the subdivision in each such school classification over the  b maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein and then applying such ratio to the  c minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein the product thereof shall be the acres of land required to be dedicated to serve the estimated increased children in each such school classification 2 school classifications and size of school site school classifications and size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria school classification by grades maximum number of students for each such school classification minimum number of acres of land for each school site of such classification elementary schools grades

plan andor the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites c criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park and school sites where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site the village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution calculated as provided herein in lieu of the land dedication required the cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the village or other public body when so designated by the village solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already serves such needs the cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the village solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that development or for the improvement to any existing school site which already serves such needs but not for the construction of any school buildings or additions thereto expenditures from school site funds held in trust shall be made only with the mutual agreement of the village and the affected school district the affected district shall furnish the village with a written notice describing the amount purpose and time of any proposed expenditure of school site trust funds within fortyfive 45 days from receipt of said notice the village shall advise the said school district whether or not the village is in agreement with the proposed expenditure if any disagreement exists the village shall designate a committee to meet with representatives of the affected school district to resolve the matter if any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication or cash contribution in lieu of school site is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within ten 10 years from the date of receipt it shall be refunded to the developer who made such contribution 1 fair market value the cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation and school sites the fair market value of such improved land shall be determined in the following manner a the village president and board of trustees shall name an appraiser who shall make an appraisal of the fair market value of such acres of land on behalf of the village  b the subdivider or developer shall name an appraiser to make such an appraisal on behalf of the subdivider or developer  c the two 2 appraisers named by the village and the subdivider or developer shall name a third appraiser to make such an appraisal of the property  d in the event that the two 2 appraisers are not able to agree upon a third appraiser the third appraiser shall be appointed by the chief judge of the us district court for the northern district of illinois eastern division  e all appraisers that shall be appointed shall be mai appraisers who shall issue bonafide appraisals of the fair market value of the land in question as if it were improved in accordance with the provisions of the hazel crest subdivision control regulations f the fair market value for the purpose of calculating cash contributions in lieu of land shall be the average value of the acres as appraised by all three appraisers 2 criteria for requiring dedication and a fee there will be situations in subdivision or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when a only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park or school site that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated  b a major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site the remaining portions shall be required by dedication and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required d density formula the following table of population density is generally indicative of current and shortrange projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer table of

the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the president and board of trustees based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the president and board of trustees by the school district or others it is recognized that population density age distribution and local conditions change over the years and the specific formula for the dedication of land or the payment of fees in lieu thereof as stated herein is subject to periodic review and amendment if necessary e example of calculation of required dedication or fees in lieu thereof the following

procedure are given to clarify the intent of the ordinance and to provide suggestions to subdividers for economizing on bond or letter of credit expenses 1 if a subdivider intends to subdivide a large plot of land it will be more economical for him if he requests approval for a plat covering only the amount of land that he intends to develop in the near future in obtaining this plat approval the subdivider would supply to the plan commission the general plan for the entire area to be developed this procedure will eliminate the necessity for the subdivider furnishing bonds or letters of credit for improvements which are to be installed several years in the future 2 if a subdivider has obtained a plat approval for a subdivision and has posted a bond or letter of credit to cover the cost of the improvements and after developing part of the plat decided to discontinue the development the board of trustees upon recommendation of the plan commission may release the bond or letter of credit for the undeveloped area providing the improvements already installed constitute properly operating and functional system and provided that the subdivider vacates the undeveloped part of the plat 3 if a subdivider desires to post a cash bond to cover the cost of improvements it is possible in view of the above provision permitting reduction of the bond or letter of credit to no less than twentyfive 25 percent of its original value that part of the cash bond can be refunded to the subdivider as the improvements are completed permitting the subdivider to use this money to pay his subcontractors
