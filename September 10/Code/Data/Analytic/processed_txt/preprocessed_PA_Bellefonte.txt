2383  curfew  2441 short title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the curfew   2442 purpose and findings this chapter is an updating of the borough curfew  prescribing in accordance with prevailing community standards regulations for the conduct of minors on streets at night effectively enforced taught in the homes internalized and adhered to for generations all for the good of minors for the furtherance of family responsibility and for the public good safety and welfare a council finds that the curfew meets a very real local need has been over the years a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and should be updated and amplified in the light of the boroughs local situation and facts including the following the borough is the oldest community in centre county with clearly defined boundaries it has near its police station a central business district it is a residential community after  pm in this quiet community as its people say the sidewalks are rolled up this community sense of the proper time for cessation of outdoor activities by minors on the streets is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this chapter consideration is also given to the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulation of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity b council finds that the borough is not overcrowded population density as reflected in the borough comprehensive plan varies by neighborhoods the total area is given in acres streets occupy acres acres are devoted to public and semipublic uses residential land use predominates and singlefamily dwellings occupy the largest portion of the residential area adequate indoor living space permits minors in the borough to occupy their time healthfully public parks and the public swimming pool maintained by the borough cease operation at  pm prevailing time commercial recreational facilities are almost nonexistent and there is little or nothing for minors to do outdoors but roam the streets after the curfew hours which this chapter declares c the borough is a stable family community parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the years inasmuch as parental control increases the likelihood of a reduction in the incidence of juvenile delinquency therefore there is a continuing need for the nocturnal curfew for minors which has achieved and will continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes hereinbefore stated  2383 bellefonte code  2443   2443

flood flows and velocities  contributes to erosion and sedimentation  overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers  greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater  undermines floodplain management and floodreduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities  reduces groundwater recharge  and threatens public health and safety b this stormwater management ordinance has been developed considering the actual hydrologic processes that occur within the spring creek watershed and how these processes can best be represented in hydrologic models that are used in engineering practice to model developing areas for stormwater management purposes processdriven stormwater management planning is critical in the spring creek watershed due to the underlying geology the spring creek watershed is mainly underlain by carbonate formations as a result significant areas within the watershed do not produce overland or surface runoff but rather contribute to the stormflow component of runoff in larger tributary areas via a greater than normal interflow component c a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment a manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems b

waterqualitysensitive developments have been identified which require special consideration with regard to stormwater management b sensitive areas are defined as those areas that if developed have the potential to cause catastrophic loss or groundwater reservoir contamination to a water authority or association or penn state university wellfield these areas consist of the delineated oneyear zone of contribution and direct upslope areas tributary to the wells or springs used as public water sources municipalities may update the sensitive area boundaries based on new research or studies as required c waterqualitysensitive wqs development is defined as a land development project that has a high potential to cause catastrophic loss to local water quality and could potentially threaten

shall be used as a guide in these determinations industrial manufacturing sites and hazardous material storage areas must provide npdes sic codes a general postdevelopment rates of runoff from any regulated activity shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development for the design storms specified b sensitive area district sad boundaries the location of sensitive areas or sensitive area districts within the watershed are illustrated on a map which is available for inspection at the municipal office the exact location of the boundaries of sensitive areas are set by drainage areas tributary to each of the points of interest the exact location of these boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined using mapping at a scale which accurately defines the limits of the sensitive area if the project site is within the sensitive area in whole or in part twofoot contour interval mapping shall be provided to define the limits of the sensitive area if the project site is not adjacent to but within 500 linear feet of a defined sensitive area a fivefoot contour interval map defining the limits of the sensitive area shall be included in the stormwater management plan to document the sites location relative to the sensitive area c sites located in more than one district for a proposed development site which is traversed by a sad boundary the design criteria for sensitive areas must be applied if postdevelopment runoff is directed towards the sensitive area d offsite areas offsite areas that drain from sensitive areas proposed development site that is located entirely in a nonsensitive area are not required to use or apply the sensitive area criteria e site areas where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the design criteria f downstream hydraulic capacity analysis any downstream or offsite hydraulic capacity analysis conducted in accordance with these standards shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates  49014 bellefonte code  49015   49016 calculation methodologies design criteria and calculation methodologies have been classified by functional group for presentation as follows 1 peak runoff rate discharge requirements  2 stormwater pond capture volumes  3 recharge volumes  4 storm drain design including conveyance channel protection and stability  and 5 water quality standards these criteria and calculation methodologies have been developed to simplify stormwater management designs unify methods remove model parameter subjectivity remove improperly used methods and to ensure stormwater management decisions are based more realistically on hydrologic processes in addition common sense should always be used as a controlling criteria these standards provide consistent and processoriented design procedures for application by land development professionals it is recognized that in an attempt to generalize the computational procedures assumptions have been made which on some occasions may be violated if such a violation is identified alternate standards and procedures may be applied both the violation and the alternate procedures to be applied must be documented by a hydrologist or hydrogeologist any request for use of alternate standards or procedures under this provision must be agreed to by the municipal engineer prior 1 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the postdevelopment runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the dep erosion and sediment pollution control program manual 2 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the postdevelopment twentyfiveyear return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property 3 culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and at a minimum pass the postdevelopment twentyfiveyear return period runoff 4 it must be demonstrated that the downstream conveyance channel other stormwater facilities roadways or overland areas must be capable of safely conveying the onehundredyear design storm without causing damage to buildings or other infrastructure 5 where the downstream conveyance channel or other facility is located within a special flood hazard area as documented on the municipal flood insurance rate map it must be demonstrated that the limits of said flood hazard area are not increased by the proposed activity 6 stormwater management ponds that fall under the dep criteria of a dam must meet the criteria within  general provisions  49016  to formal submission of plans for consideration by the municipality a flow chart documenting the stormwater management design process is provided as chart a9 stormwater procedural flow chart of this chapter58 a peak runoff rate control 1 exemption a any site where the increase in postdevelopment peak runoff rates is determined to be negligible by the municipal engineer is exempt from the requirement to provide stormwater detention in support of this exemption it must be shown that the downstream conveyance systems have adequate capacity to convey the additional discharge without adversely affecting downstream properties this does not exempt the requirement for implementation of designs for water quality stormwater conveyance andor recharge as required a stormwater management plan and report documenting these design elements is also required the municipal engineer shall use a fivepercent increase as a general bench mark for defining negligible the final definition of negligible shall be at the municipal engineers discretion prior to using this exemption and prior to any land development plan submission the design engineer must provide written documentation and computations as to why no peak runoff control should be required the municipal engineer has the right to reject any plan which uses this assumption without prior approval of the municipal engineer the intent of this exemption is to eliminate the need for multiple or piggyback detention facilities as a result of minor changes in imperviousness or land use upstream of existing stormwater control facilities b small sites less than five acres located directly adjacent to the main stem of creeks or within the floodplain are not required to provide stormwater detention unless directed to do so by the municipal engineer as a result of a documented drainage problem all other stormwater management standards must be implemented including water quality adequate stormwater conveyance andor recharge as required the municipal engineer has the right to reject any plan that uses this exemption without prior approval of the municipal engineer 2 stormwater management analysis a stormwater management analysis must be performed using the following models the size criteria are based on drainage area size including site area and all offsite area draining across the development 58editors note the flow chart is on file and available in the boroughs offices  49016 bellefonte code  49016   up to 100 acres in size nrcss tr55 or tr20  over 100 acres in size nrcss tr20 or hec1 hechms b the rational method or modified rational method may be used for any site less than or equal to two acres in size without prior authorization from the municipal engineer the rational method or modified rational method may also be used for sites between two and 20 acres in size where the municipal engineer has approved the methods use in this case the design engineer must make a written request to the municipal engineer explaining why the use of the rational method is more appropriate than the nrcss methods for the site in question the design engineer should keep in mind that the rational formula methodology was not calibrated to account for the karst nature of the spring creek drainage basin  and therefore its use should be limited to the special cases identified above in addition since the minimum discharge criteria are based on a calibration of the nrcs runoff mode their use is not appropriate if the rational method is used for runoff computations c the municipal engineer has the right to reject any swm design that uses hydrograph combinations with the rational method where the designer has not validated that the effects of the timing differences are negligible in addition the municipal engineer has the right to reject any swm design that improperly uses the method for determining runoff volumes or does not properly apply the method d moreintensive physicallybased models may be used at the discretion of the municipal engineer but only for sites greater than 100 acres in size e commercial software packages that use the basic computational methods of tr55 or tr20 are permitted f the nrcs models and methods recommended above are based on data collected from actual watersheds in contrast to this stormwater management analysis for land development activities is often conducted using property lines to define drainage boundaries drainage areas based on property boundaries are not true watersheds and are referred to here as hypothetical drainage areas it is known that these hypothetical drainage areas do not respond like natural watersheds peak runoff rates from hypothetical drainage areas are much smaller than comparable runoff rates from natural watersheds of the same size therefore wherever possible predevelopment and postdevelopment stormwater analysis should be conducted for watersheds that are as nearly  49016 general provisions  49016  natural as possible also conducting stormwater analysis for a lotbylot comparison such as within residential developments is not permitted partitioning drainage areas into different subwatersheds for the postdevelopment scenarios is acceptable g it is noted that natural watershed boundaries should not be used where the relative size of the watershed compared to the site size would inappropriately distort the predevelopment to postdevelopment runoff comparison in these cases a hypothetical drainage area defined by the property boundary should be used because it will allow for a better estimate of runoff changes directly downstream of the site in addition the designer should recognize that within the spring creek watershed typical hypothetical drainage areas in their predevelopment or natural condition do not produce surface runoff during minor to moderate rainfall events available hydrologic models do not accurately reflect this condition this often results in postdevelopment nuisance flooding since the models overestimate the predevelopment runoff magnitude 3 major natural drainage divides may not be altered without the prior consent of the municipal engineer 4 predevelopment and postdevelopment stormwater management analysis a predevelopment and postdevelopment stormwater management analysis shall be conducted using the following design storms  one year twoyear  ten year onehundredyear b for sites less than one acre in total area that connect directly to existing storm sewer systems surface or subsurface underground stormwater detention facilities only need to be designed to control storm events up to the design return period of the existing pipes usually 10 years however it must be demonstrated that adequate conveyance capacity overland or within the existing storm sewer system exists to ensure that flooding or damage from proposed releases will not exceed the existing potential for the system if warranted by historic flooding in the tributary storm sewer system the municipality may require more stringent criteria c the municipal engineer may waive the requirement to detain the onehundredyear storm as long as the discharge is to a welldefined functioning conveyance system that does not currently exhibit flooding or other conveyance problems the downstream conveyance system must be analyzed for the one  49016 bellefonte code  49016  hundredyear event to ensure that the proposed development will not increase flooding or damage to existing buildings and or infrastructure 5 the following twentyfourhour precipitation depths shall be used for stormwater management analysis for the entire spring creek basin these values override the use of tp40 the basis of the nrcs twentyfourhour precipitation maps return period precipitation depth inches 1year 22 2year 26 10year 35 25year 42 50year 47 100year 53 6 the nrcss type ii precipitation distribution is required for all stormwater management analyses 7 the nrcss dimensionless unit hydrograph k factor shall be 484 for both predevelopment and postdevelopment stormwater analyses 8 all undeveloped areas are to be modeled as meadow or woods in good hydrologic condition existing impervious areas may be modeled as being impervious for predevelopment conditions the only exception is areas that are actively in agricultural production nonfallow the designer may model the watershed using the actual agricultural land usecover condition to show that increases from the site as compared to the allmeadow condition are negligible 9 the nrcss curve number cn shall be used as the rainfalltorunoff transformation parameter for all stormwater management analyses 10 curve numbers should be rounded to tenths for use in prepackaged hydrologic models it should be recognized that the cn is only a design tool with a large degree of statistical variability for large sites cns should realistically be rounded to the nearest whole number 11 the nrcss method to determine unconnected impervious area adjustments for cn can be used for distinctly defined impervious land areas that flow onto pervious areas in a dispersed manner the method may only be used to calculate runoff from site impervious  49016 general provisions  49016  areas that actually flow across pervious areas the method cannot be applied to the entire site using average weighted cn values 12 soils underlain by carbonate geology limestone or dolomite shall have a hydrologic soil group hsg b used for both predevelopment and postdevelopment conditions regardless of the nrcs or soil surveys description except for the following two conditions a compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum of hsg c for postdevelopment conditions regardless of the nrcs or soil surveys description for most developments compacted structural fill areas are under impervious surfaces but may include islands within parking areas fringe land etc a hsg c shall also be applied to large projects that clear and compact building pad areas for later phases of development under an initial phase the municipal engineer shall make the final determination as to what areas of a land development site constitute compacted structural fill the intent is to account for large compacted areas and not minor grading within lawn areas b soils identified as on floodplains or on terraces above floodplains in the centre county soil survey will use the hsg as designated in the soil survey refer to appendix a table a8 for a list of the soils59 13 soils not underlain by carbonate geology shall use the hsg as specified by the nrcs or soil surveys description except for the following two conditions a wooded areas on hsg c and d soils shall be treated as hsg b for predevelopment conditions disturbed postdevelopment wooded areas shall carry the nrcs or soil surveys defined hsg with a minimum hsg of b b highly compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum of hsg c for postdevelopment conditions regardless of the nrcs or soil surveys description for most developments these areas are normally covered with impervious surfaces but may include islands within parking areas fringe land etc a hsg of c shall also be used for large projects that clear and grade land for later phases of development the municipal engineer shall make the final determination as to what areas of a land development site constitute compacted structural fill the intent is to account for large compacted areas and not minor grading within lawn areas or small areas around buildings etc 14 areas draining to closed depressions must be modeled by removing the storage volume from the predevelopment condition the 59editors note appendix a is on file and available in the boroughs offices  49016 bellefonte code  49016  designer may assume that infiltration in the closed depression does not occur during a design runoff event areas draining to closed depressions may also be used to adjust peak runoff rates to stormwater management ponds for the postdevelopment analysis this allowance has been developed to entice designers to intentionally design or leave in place small closed depressions that can reduce the total volume required from a stormwater management pond the site designer is responsible to document downstream impacts if the closed depression were removed 15 drainage areas tributary to sinkholes shall be excluded from the modeled pointofinterest drainage areas defining predevelopment peak flows assumptions that sinkholes spill over during some storm events must be supported by acceptable documentation as determined by the municipal engineer in addition the design professional must be aware that bypassing or sealing sinkholes will frequently result in downstream flooding and should not be done if existing downstream flooding already occurs the site designer is responsible to document downstream impacts if the sinkhole were to stop taking stormwater runoff 16 ponds or other permanent pools of water are to be modeled by the methods established in the nrcss tr55 manual 1986 however more rigorous documented methods are acceptable as determined by the municipal engineer 17 the nrcs antecedent runoff condition ii arc ii previously amc ii must be used for all simulations the use of continuous simulation models that vary the arc are not permitted for stormwater management purposes in addition prior to any continuous simulation model being used in the spring creek basin for any other purposes the model unit hydrograph must be modified for common events in addition to extreme events based on an indepth analysis of historical data from the basin 18 timeofconcentration computational methodologies a the following timeofconcentration tc computational methodologies shall be used unless another method is preapproved by the municipal engineer  predevelopment nrcss lag equation  postdevelopment  commercial industrial or other areas with large impervious areas greater than 20% impervious area nrcss segmental method  postdevelopment  residential cluster or other lowimpact designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area ncrss lag equation  49016 general provisions  49016  b the time of concentration is to represent the average condition that best reflects the hydrologic response of the area for example large impervious areas bordered by small pervious areas may not consider the effect of the pervious areas in the tc computation if the designer wants to consider the effect of the pervious area runoff from the pervious and impervious areas must be computed separately with the hydrographs being combined to determine the total runoff from the area c under no circumstance will the postdevelopment tc be greater than the predevelopment tc for any watershed or subwatershed modeling purposes this includes when the designer has specifically used swales to reduce flow velocities in the event that the designer believes that the postdevelopment tc is greater it will still be set by default equal to the predevelopment tc for modeling purposes  refer to 28 regarding impervious area flashing iaf 19 postdevelopment minimum discharges a the following postdevelopment minimum discharges are permitted for use with the nrcs cn runoff model 1year return period qpmin    da + 02 2year return period qpmin   003 da + 04 10year return period qpmin   009 da + 10 where da   the drainage area in acres qpmin   minimum allowable peak runoff rate in cfs b for return periods greater than 10 years the minimum discharge shall be equal to the computed predevelopment peak runoff rate c the minimum discharge criteria above are not appropriate for use with the rational method this is because these values were developed based on nrcs model corrections and do not actually represent a true physical process or discharge however common sense should be used by both the designer and reviewer in the evaluation of acceptable minimum discharges for use with the rational method d the intent of the minimum discharge is to allow reasonable runoff release from a site when a hydrologic model has produced a predevelopment runoff rate close to zero the method is not permitted for areas that previously drained  49016 bellefonte code  49016  completely to sinkholes in order to bypass the sinkhole after development e these minimum discharge values include the total of all stormwater management facilities discharges and undetained area discharges peak runoff rates for undetained fringe areas where the designer has made a realistic effort to control all new impervious areas will be computed using the predevelopment time of concentration for the drainage areas tributary to them undetained areas are those portions of the site that cannot be routed to a stormwater management facility due to topography and typically include lower pond berms or small areas around entrance drives the site drainage areas used shall represent the predevelopment condition even if drainage areas are altered following development 20 all lined stormwater management ponds in carbonate and noncarbonate areas must be considered impervious and may not be used as pervious areas for stormwater management computations lined here means lined with synthetic liners or bentonite all other compacted soil liners will be considered to be hsg d for hydrologic computations 21 stormwater management ponds that have a capture depth for the purposes of water quality or volume capture shall assume a negligible discharge from these structures during design event routing only discharges from the primary principal spillway or emergency spillway need to be considered discharges from subsurface drains that tie into a principal spillway should not be considered during design event routing 22 stormwater management ponds that have a capture depth for the purposes of water quality or volume capture shall assume that the pond water quality or capture volume is full at the beginning of design event routing 23 stormwater management ponds must provide safe passage of the onehundredyear return period peak runoff rate assuming that all of the principal spillway orifices are fully clogged and the principal spillway overflow is 50% clogged a minimum of a sixinch freeboard must also be maintained above the resulting maximum water surface elevations wse any embankment emergency spillway can be assumed to be unclogged swm ponds with embankments completely made up of natural undisturbed soils fully in cut or where roadways act as the emergency spillway are permitted however the design engineer must verify downstream stability and control 24 all predevelopment and postdevelopment comparisons of peak flows shall be rounded to tenths of a cfs the intent here is to recognize the accuracy and precision limitations of hydrologic  49016 general provisions  49016  modeling procedures again small differences between predevelopment and postdevelopment discharge rates should be permitted when no negative downstream impacts will result 25 the full modified plus routing method must be used for stormwater management pond analyses simplified methods of determining pond size requirements such as those in tr55 1986 can only be used for preliminary pond size estimates the full modified puls routing method must be used for stormwater management pond analyses simplified methods of determining pond size requirements such as those in tr55 1986 can only be used for preliminary pond size estimates 26 prepackaged hydraulic programs are not approved for the analysis of underground stormwater management facilities unless it can be verified that the program rounding subroutines used for the stage storage data do not affect the results this is because for very small storage volumes the program may round off the volume to a significant percentage 27 full supporting documentation must be provided for all stormwater management designs 28 designs must be checked for impervious area flash iaf this check is used to determine if flooding may occur due to poor modeling choices specifically related to the time of concentration this analysis requires that the watershed impervious area be modeled without the pervious areas the time of concentration should also be determined from the impervious areas only if the iaf analysis results in a higher peak runoff rate at a culvert or discharge from a pond this higher rate must be used for the final designcomparison the check will frequently yield higher values if a watersheds impervious area is located primarily near the watershed outlet or point of interest b pond capture volumes cv 1 to minimize nuisance flooding from small precipitation events a runoff capture volume is required for all stormwater management ponds that do not discharge directly to natural welldefined with bed and banks perennial streams in general natural welldefined streams in the spring creek basin are limited to those delineated as usgs perennial streams this should be treated as a guideline and not a steadfast rule the final determination is at the discretion of the municipal engineer the pond capture volume is a volume of runoff that will be retained in a pond below the elevation of any free surface principal spillway orifice no principal spillway orifice except those connected to subsurface drains regardless of how small shall be below the pond elevation equivalent to this volume 2 the centre county conservation district cccd receives numerous complaints regarding ponds that are located at the  49016 bellefonte code  49016  downslope edge of a property that result in discharging runoff onto downstream properties in an uncontrolled manner or where no existing defined outlet channel exists this is a very common problem in areas underlain by carbonate rock these discharges can cause erosion and flooding downstream while the pond capture volume is intended to minimize some of these negative effects it cannot deter or reduce the impacts from poor design practices therefore whenever possible the cccd recommends that the designer consider the downstream morphological changes that may occur and when possible consider constructing conveyance systems to a stable natural channel in some cases this may require cooperation between landowners 3 the capture volume is defined as a runoff depth of 025 inches from all impervious areas tributary to the stormwater management facility this volume will be allowed to infiltrate evaporate or dewater from a subsurface drain system connected directly to the facilitys principal spillway supporting computations that show that 90% of the capture volume can dewater in a maximum of 72 hours must be provided for surface ponds the maximum depth of ponding for the capture volume shall be three feet a health and safety precaution however in areas under karst influence a limiting maximum ponding depth of 18 inches is recommended designers may always increase the capture volume to a value greater than the identified standard as long as the ponding depth criteria are met 4 to simplify computational requirements for design event analysis designers do not need to calculate discharges from subsurface drains related to the capture volumes if the filter media is sand or smaller than aashto 57 stone the capture volume is to control runoff rates from impervious areas and is not related to water quality however pond designs that include a water quality volume that is greater than the required capture volume are assumed to have also met the required capture volume as long as it dewaters as required 5 designs that rely on the natural infiltration of insitu soils must provide documentation supporting the infiltration rates used for analysis infiltration rates reported in the soil survey of centre county or other published rates may be used at the discretion of the municipal engineer 6 the pond capture volume should always be used when upslope areas are developed where the ponds design creates a point discharge that did not previously exist 7 stormwater management detention facilities that connect directly to storm drainpipe networks that discharge to natural welldefined channels do not require a capture volume  49016 general provisions  49016  c recharge volumes rv 1 the purpose of the recharge portion of the chapter is twofold first the recharge requirement is to mitigate the loss of groundwater recharge associated with the creation of impervious surfaces in addition the recharge criteria is to mitigate the increase in runoff volume associated with the creation of impervious surfaces this increase in runoff volume has significant impacts on downstream landowners these impacts are most often exhibited in the form of increased nuisance flooding and channel or drainageway erosion and instability according to local municipal engineers and representatives of the centre county conservation district these problems are of significant local concern the magnitude of these problems increases with the percentage of impervious coverage created on a site 2 recharge mitigation shall be provided for runoff from all proposed impervious areas the required recharge volume shall be computed as 05 inch of runoff from all proposed impervious areas it is noted that lined detention ponds and compacted fill areas are considered to be impervious when calculating site impervious area for recharge considerations in addition land areas covered by paver blocks pervious pavement and other structural surface treatments which permit surface infiltration can be treated as pervious areas when calculating the site impervious area for recharge considerations as long as the structural infiltration practice is supported by sound design and appropriate construction specifications the municipal engineer may require submission of supporting documentation prior to approving structural infiltration areas as pervious areas 3 the following design practices can be used as credits to reduce the recharge volume requirement a residential roof areas detached duplex and townhome dwellings and commercialindustrial buildings with roof areas less than 5000 square feet can be removed from the computed impervious area when these roof areas are sumped to dry wells designed in accordance with the following minimum standard  sump design criteria to meet the recharge criteria sump storage or voids volume shall be equal to 004 cubic feet per square foot of roof area 05 inch rainfall depth if sump stone has a voids ratio of 40% the total sump volume will be 010 cubic feet per square foot of roof area when designed only to meet this recharge criteria the maximum size for a single sump is 100 cubic feet and the minimum sump surface area a to depth d ratio ad must be a minimum of 41 the sump depth less any freeboard should not exceed 24 inches this roof sump standard shall apply  49016 bellefonte code  49016  unless the municipality has a separate roof sump standard for water quantity or peak control b all or portions of driveways roadways and parking areas can be removed from the impervious area calculation when sheet flow from these areas is directed to undisturbed natural buffer filter areas or constructed filter strips this flow must be dispersed as sheet flow as it crosses the bufferfilter area sheet flow velocities should be nonerosive as they cross the impervious areafilter interface  to ensure proper infiltration characteristics the natural soil profile within natural bufferfilter areas cannot be disturbed during construction completely undisturbed natural recharge areas serve this function best however minor surface scarring seeding and landscaping is permitted in these areas as long as natural grades are not altered in special cases when approved by the municipal engineer minor grading combined with soil profile reconstruction may be permitted in natural bufferfilter areas in addition the following standards apply to natural filterbuffer areas a natural filterbuffer areas must have a minimum width of five feet or 12 of the impervious area drainage length immediately tributary to the buffer area whichever is greater this width is measured parallel to the direction of sheet flow b to qualify for a recharge volume credit the surface slope of natural filterbuffer areas must be conducive to recharge and not result in flow concentration or erosion to meet this intent the surface slope of the area tributary to the natural bufferfilter area and the surface slope of the natural bufferfilter area itself may not exceed 5% in special cases steeper slopes may be used if specifically authorized by the municipal engineer c the total impervious area tributary to a natural buffer filter area cannot exceed twice the bufferfilter area  to qualify for a recharge volume credit constructed filter strips shall be designed to the following standards a the minimum filter strip width shall be five feet or 12 of the impervious area drainage length immediately tributary to the constructed filter strip whichever is greater this width is measured parallel to the direction of sheet flow  49016 general provisions  49016  b the total impervious area tributary to a constructed filter strip area cannot exceed twice the constructed filter strip area c the surface slope of the area tributary to the constructed filter strip area and the surface slope of the constructed filter strip area itself may not exceed 5% and 3% respectively in special cases steeper slopes may be used if specifically authorized by the municipal engineer d the filter strip surface shall consist of a minimum of six inches of natural or reconstructed topsoil with a stable grass surface treatment reconstructed topsoil designs must be approved by the municipal engineer prior to application reconstructed topsoil consists of soils augmented by tillage and the addition of soil amendments such as compost lime animal manures crop residues etc e to minimize erosion of the topsoil layer during construction it is recommended that these areas be sodded however the municipal engineer may permit the use of an acceptable erosion control seeding application in this later case any loss of topsoil and seed must be replaced until a permanent vegetative stand is achieved c sidewalks separated from roadways andor other impervious surfaces by a grass strip of equal or greater width than the sidewalk itself can be removed from the impervious area calculation when the sidewalks are graded so that sheet flow from the walk is directed to the grass strip sidewalks with steep longitudinal slopes that themselves would act as channels during runoff events cannot take advantage of this credit a fivepercent longitudinal sidewalk slope shall be used as the bench mark defining steep slopes d impervious areas tributary to natural closed depressions can be subtracted from the total site impervious area used in the recharge volume calculation as long as a qualified geotechnical engineer or soil scientist certifies to the soundness of these sitespecific applications water quality pretreatment may be necessary prior to the direct discharge of runoff to existing closed depressions or sinkholes e impervious areas tributary to manmade closed depressions can be subtracted from the total site impervious area as long as a qualified geotechnical engineer or soil scientist certifies to the soundness of these sitespecific applications manmade  49016 bellefonte code  49016  closed depressions can be created use of low head berms one foot or less in height f the entire capture volume provided in a pond without a subsurface drain may be used as a credit towards the recharge volume requirement g fifty percent of the capture volume in a pond that includes a subsurface drain may be credited towards the recharge volume requirement h additional credits may apply for undisturbed land areas that are known to have highinfiltration capacity and that are maintained or enhanced these areas must be defined and quantified from actual site data collection 4 after credits the remaining recharge volume shall be directed to a recharge bmp such as infiltration trenches beds etc these facilities can be located in open areas or under pavement structures the appropriateness of the particular infiltration practice proposed as well as the design parameters used shall be supported by a geotechnical report certified by a qualified professional soil scientist geologist hydrogeologist geotechnical engineer etc 5 stormwater recharge requirements or credits affect stormwater management design requirements for stormwater management computations the reduction of site cns based only on a weightingtype analysis as is sometimes done for clustertype developments is not permitted however for stormwater management purposes the cn for recharged areas can be computed using the nrcs method for disconnected impervious areas the actual hydrologic process that occurs within the basin must be stressed in all recharge situations 6 these recharge requirements must be met on all sites unless it can be demonstrated that recharge would be inappropriate any request for such a waiver from these recharge requirements must be accompanied by a supporting report certified by a qualified professional soil scientist geologist hydrogeologist geotechnical engineer etc 7 developers and site design professionals are encouraged to use a higher standard for recharge volume on sites where local site conditions do not restrict a higher standard 8 waterqualitysensitive wqs developments must use an acceptable pretreatment bmp prior to recharge acceptable pretreated bmps for these developments include bmps that are based on filtering settling or chemical reaction processes such as chemical coagulation  49016 general provisions  49016  9 accounting for recharge within lined stormwater management ponds is not permitted however if unlined uncompacted ponds andor depressed lawn areas are used to satisfy water quality or capture volume criteria these areas and volumes can also be used to meet recharge requirements as previously defined additional recharge volume may be credited to these areas as long as it is demonstrated by a qualified professional that recharge processes can naturally occur in these areas 10 finally because this analysis is concerned with trying to adequately represent real processes that occur within the watershed there will be areas that cannot physically recharge stormwater these areas include exfiltration areas that are commonly found at the base of wooded hillsides where claypans exist and saturation areas near major streams or floodplains these areas may not accept recharge during most runoff events these areas are exempt from recharge requirements when these conditions are documented and certified by a qualified professional soil scientist geologist hydrogeologist or geotechnical engineer in addition stormwater management techniques relying on infiltration techniques are not permitted in these areas 11 the municipal engineer may waive the recharge requirement in the following situations a the municipal engineer may waive the recharge requirement in highly developed areas or areas undergoing redevelopment where the municipal engineer has determined that forced recharge could have adverse impacts on adjacent landowner structures property or municipal infrastructure these waivers should be limited to small land areas generally less than five acres in size where the ability to place recharge beds may be limited or may hinder redevelopment b the municipal engineer may waive the recharge requirement in areas where a qualified soils scientist or geologist has determined that none of the site soils are suitable for recharge or that the location of the suitable soils is such that harm to adjoining properties could occur as stated under 11a above c the municipal engineer may waive the recharge requirement in areas where recharge cannot physically occur as documented by a qualified soil scientist geologist or hydrologist these areas include  exfiltration areas commonly found at the base of wooded hillsides where claypans or fragipans exist  and  saturation areas near major streams or floodplains  49016 bellefonte code  49016  12 as identified above recharge analysis andor waiver requests must be supported by a geotechnical report sealed by a qualified professional soil scientist geologist hydrogeologist or geotechnical engineer the intent of this report will be to establish the suitability of a particular parcel of land or area for recharge and to identify areas on a development site appropriate for recharge it is recommended that the geotechnicalsoils consultant discuss the extent and approach to the analysis with the municipal engineer prior to initiating the field investigation at a minimum this report should include the following information a a description of the geotechnical site investigation performed including the methods and procedures used  b data presentation  c analysis results including the following minimum information  a map identifying site areas inappropriate for recharge along with supporting justification in addition to illustrating topographic features significant geologic and hydrologic features should be identified rock outcrops sinkholes closed depressions etc  determination of the permeability coefficient for potential recharge areas  determination of the infiltration capacity of natural site soils  location depth and permeability coefficient for any restrictive layers identified  soil uniformity  depth to bedrock in potential recharge areas and a statement reflecting the uniformity of the depth to bedrock across the site  a statement relating to the sites proximity to fracture zones within the bedrock  additional information deemed pertinent by the geotechnical engineer d recommendations for any special design considerations necessary for the design of recharge systems on the site for example required soil depth over bedrock appropriate surface grades over recharge areas appropriate hydraulic head over recharge areas etc e justification as to why the site should be developed to a high impervious density if the site has adverse soil and geotechnical  49016 general provisions  49016  limitations which prohibit the ability to induce natural recharge explain how these limitations will not create the potential for undue harm to the environment and the spring creek watershed when the site is developed 13 the following guidelines are provided relative to the use of subsurface exfiltration bmps often incorrectly referred to as engineered infiltration bmps a soils should have a minimum percolation rate of 50 mincm 047 inhr for effective operation of subsurface exfiltration bmps if no site soils have percolation rates of 50 mincm subsurface exfiltration bmps should not be used b a minimum of 30 inches of soil must be maintained between the bottom of a subsurface exfiltration bmp and the top of bedrock or seasonally high groundwater table this requirement may be modified subject to the recommendation of a qualified geotechnical professional c if the minimum percolation rate is not met andor the minimum soil depth cannot be maintained on a site recharge should be accommodated by directing shallow sheet flow from impervious areas across surface filter strips andor undisturbed natural areas or some other innovative surface infiltration feature should be used limiting subsurface percolation rates andor depth to bedrock shall not by themselves warrant a recharge waiver 14 in addition since recharge is intended as a volume control innovative or new methods that address the significant increase in the volume of runoff from sites having large impervious areas are encouraged these volumecontrol alternatives can be used only if they can be shown to function with the original intent engineering and science d storm drain conveyance system design storm drainage conveyance systems consist of storm sewer pipes swales and open channels computational methods for design of storm drain conveyance systems shall be as follows 1 recommended

municipal engineer such as swmm swirmroute etc 2 rational coefficients used are to be from rawls et al 1981 penndot design manual 210 or using the aron curves to convert cns to c if the aron curves are used all cns must be applicable to the hsg as identified by the nrcs the design engineer may choose to use the following rational c coefficients without regard to soil hsg for small sites however it is recommended that they be used only for storm drains up to 24 inches in diameter the use of these conservative values shall fully be the choice of the design engineer a all impervious areas c

safely downstream 4 inlets on grade cannot assume a sumped condition for hydraulic modeling ie topofinlet casting set below pavement surface in parking areas 5 the municipal engineer may require the analysis of the onehundred year peak runoff rates for conveyance purposes in some instances where regional swm facilities are employed 6 any storm drain within state or federal rightsofways or that falls under the design criteria of any higher authority must meet the requirements of that agency in addition to the minimum requirements of this chapter 7 the time of concentration tc can be computed by any method which best represents the subject watershed however the nrcss segmental method is not recommended for use with drainage areas that are predominately undeveloped and are greater than 100 acres in size the nrcs lag equation or another more appropriate method should be used under these conditions 8 for any drainage area smaller than five acres in size a tc of five minutes may always be assumed at the discretion of the design engineer for the postdevelopment condition without needing to provide supporting documentation 9 precipitation values applicable to the entire spring creek

techniques identified below may be limited for suitability and use based on development type and location these limitations for use are specified in the restrictions section for each credit the municipal engineer may require additional documentation or investigation prior to use of each specific credit to reduce the risks of sinkhole development or groundwater contamination for sensitive areas and development types no area may be double counted for use with credits the combined credits of natural area conservation and vegetated filter strips is limited to 50% of the sites impervious area the drainageway credit is limited to 50% of the sites impervious area the drainageway protection credit is limited to 50% of the sites impervious area the maximum total water quality credit for

natural karst drainageways within the spring creek watershed often do not exhibit a defined channel bed and banks more often these drainageways appear as wide shallow parabolic swales these drainageways are an integral part of the natural drainage system and often exhibit significant infiltration capacity protection of these drainageways is critically important to the health of the watershed b the drainageway protection dwp area is defined as an area centered on the drainageway and having a minimum width of 300 feet the municipal engineer may modify the defined minimum width in cases where natural land forms define an appropriate alternate width c the impervious area used in the wqv equation for the development site may be reduced by twice the area of the preserved drainageway  ratio  restrictions on the credit a drainageway protection areas must remain in an undisturbed condition during and after construction activities there can be no construction activity within these areas including temporary access roads or storage of equipment or materials temporary access for the construction of utilities crossing this protection area may be permitted at the municipal engineers discretion however the alignment of any such crossing must be perpendicular to the drainageway b these areas should be placed in a conservation easement or be permanently preserved similarly enforceable agreement with the municipality c the limits of the undisturbed dwp area and conservation easement must be shown on all construction plans d the dwp area must be located on the development site e the maximum total dwpa credit is 100% of the site impervious area f water quality credits are not permitted for waterquality sensitive wqs developments  sensitive area and development restrictions  49016 general provisions  49016  a dwp areas may not be counted as a credit in sensitive areas unless the impervious area actually flows across the area as sheet flow b untreated urban runoff from sensitive development types may not be directed to dwp areas without pretreatment 5 natural area conservation a water quality credit is given for natural areas that are conserved at the development site thereby maintaining predevelopment water quality characteristics the impervious area used in the wqv equation for the development site may be reduced by the natural area conserved in the water quality volume computations natural area conservation is different than vegetated filter striprecharge area and drainageway protection in that in some cases surface runoff may never be directed over the natural area ie if upslope wooded areas are conserved a restrictions on the credit  natural areas must remain in an undisturbed condition during and after construction activities temporary incidental land disturbance activities associated with utility construction may be permitted within the conservation area  these areas should be placed in a conservation easement or similarly enforceable agreement with the municipality  the limits of the undisturbed area and conservation easement must be shown on all construction plans  the area must be located on the development site  water quality credits are not permitted for waterqualitysensitive wqs developments  the maximum total nac credit is 50% of the site impervious area however the combination of nac vfrs is also 50% b sensitive area and development restrictions  nac areas may not be counted as a credit in sensitive areas unless the impervious area actually flows across the area as sheet flow  untreated urban runoff from sensitive development types may not be directed to natural areas without pretreatment 6 filterbuffer area  49016 bellefonte code  49016  a a water quality credit is given when stormwater runoff is effectively treated via a filterbuffer area or strip a filterbuffer area is a vegetated boundary characterized by uniform mild slopes filter strips may be forested or vegetated with turf grass effective treatment is achieved when impervious area runoff is directed as sheet flow across vegetative filter or buffer areas ie concentrated flow discharged to a filter strip does not meet water quality reduction criteria b the area draining via overland sheet flow to an undisturbed natural vegetated filter strip natural unmaintained meadow or forested area can be subtracted from the site impervious area ia on a  area ratio in the water quality volume computation impervious areas draining across constructed disturbed or regarded pervious areas can be subtracted from the site impervious area ia on a 2 area ratio in the water quality volume computation  restrictions on the credit a the maximum impervious area that can be included in this credit shall be computed as follows iac   wia lia where iac   impervious area recharge credit l2 lia   length of impervious area measured perpendicular to the sheet flow direction l wia   width of impervious area l  maximum width permitted for credit is the smaller of 100 feet or twice the width of the vegetated filter strip b to qualify for a water quality credit natural and constructed filter areas or strips must meet the same restrictions identified for natural or constructed recharge areas with regard to width length slope tributary drainage length and construction these restrictions are presented in of the stormwater management plan c runoff shall enter the filterbuffer strip as overland sheet flow d filterbuffer areas shall remain undisturbed unmanaged other than to remove accumulated trash and debris  49016 general provisions  49016   49017 erosion and sedimentation requirements e water quality credits are not permitted for waterquality sensitive wqs developments f the maximum total water quality credit for vegetative filterbuffer areas is 50% of the site impervious area however the combination of nac and filterbuffer areas is also 50%  sensitive area and development restrictions a untreated urban runoff from wqs developments may not be directed to filterbuffer areas without pretreatment 7 comments related to water quality credits a concurrence of the municipal engineer is required prior to the use of all water quality credits for the reduction of the water quality treatment volume the municipal engineer may approve the use of additional credits based upon sufficient documentation regarding suitability for sensitive development types and areas pollutant removal effectiveness and maintenance criteria multiple water quality credits cannot be claimed for the identical area of the site ie a stream buffer credit and disconnecting roof recharge area cannot both be claimed for the same area b additional impervious coverage reduction using lowimpact development techniques development practices which reduce the impact of urban runoff such as narrower residential road sections smaller culsdesac smaller parking stalls smaller building setbacks to reduce driveway lengths etc will also reduce the required water quality treatment volume many of these techniques require prior approval by the municipality before implementation into land development design a whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed such activity must be in conformance with title 25 rules and regulations commonwealth of pennsylvania department of environmental protection subpart c protection of natural resources water resources erosion control and in accordance with the centre county conservation district and the standards and specifications of the appropriate municipal government the centre county conservation district has been delegated the authority by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection to administer the erosion and

the centre county conservation district applicant must provide proof  49016 bellefonte code  49017   49018 sinkhole protection the use of sinkholes for stormwater management must be carefully planned because discharging runoff directly into existing sinkholes is not an engineered stormwater solution aside from potential water quality effects cover collapse sinkholes that exist throughout the watershed can be unstable and it should be assumed that they could stop taking water at any time numerous sinkholes throughout the region already flood during larger runoff events nonetheless in the watershed there are large drainage areas that completely drain to existing sinkholes and all upslope development tributary to them cannot be realistically stopped therefore the following sections have been developed of approval of the erosion and sediment pollution control plan prior to stormwater plan approval b additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and criteria that must be or are recommended to be applied where recharge or water quality bmps are proposed and include the following 1 areas proposed for these bmps shall be protected from sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase so as to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity 2 these bmps shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until the entire contributory drainage area to the bmp has received final stabilization c adequate erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels and at all points of discharge a stormwater from roadways parking lots storm sewers roof drains or other concentrated runoff paths shall not be discharged directly into sinkholes without prior filtration in accordance with  49018b below b filter paths 1 sinkholes capable of absorbing substantial amounts of stormwater shall be protected by diverting such runoff around the sinkhole refer to  or upon recommended approval of the municipal engineer by planting and maintaining a dense filter path of suitable vegetative material in such a manner and location to disperse and slow the runoff to a sheet flow condition to promote the maximum possible filtration and sedimentation of impurities 2 the filter path must be at least 100 feet in length and 20 feet in width tenfootwide filter paths are acceptable if land slope is less than 2% 3 filter paths shall be designed and installed so that they filter sheet flow rather than concentrated flow if concentrated flow occurs  49017 general provisions  49018   49019 design criteria for stormwater management facilities materials workmanship and

conjunction with temporary stone filter check dams shall be installed prior to subdivision or land development construction activities where sinkholes are used to accept stormwater discharges c if increased runoff is to be discharged into a sinkhole even in filtered conditions a hydrogeologic assessment of the effects of such runoff on the increased risk of land subsidence and adverse impacts to existing sinkhole floodplains and groundwater quality shall be made by a qualified professional and submitted with the stormwater management plan such discharge shall be prohibited if the municipal engineer determines that such poses a hazard to life property or groundwater resources d all sinkholes shall be posted by permanent onsite notices clearly visible at the sinkhole prohibiting any disposal of refuse rubbish hazardous wastes organic matter or soil into the sinkhole rock fill may be permitted in the sinkhole for the purpose of preventing dumping of said materials e to protect sensitive karst areas the municipal engineer may require basins to contain an impervious liner the liner may be of the impervious membrane type placed in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations or may be constructed by mixing bentonite or an approved alternative with existing soil available at the site as approved by the municipal engineer f if it is determined that runoff from upslope developing areas should be diverted around a sinkhole due to existing problems the municipal engineer may require additional upstream volume controls as required to protect downstream areas g if a sinkhole is to be utilized as part of the volume control of a stormwater management plan a note must be added to the plan stating if the sinkhole that is a component of this stormwater management plan closes or does not accept water all owners of the stormwater management plan tributary to the closed sinkhole shall install volumecontrol bmps or provide safe conveyance to a suitable

impervious liners only in areas with a high risk of sinkhole formation or potential groundwater contamination as determined by a geotechnical engineer however where a liner is deemed necessary or appropriate the use of controlled compacted natural clay liners for swm basins should be considered locally available clay when properly installed can provide near impervious conditions approximately e6 cms or less some of the advantages of using controlled compacted natural clay soil liners are a can offer better longterm solution as a basin liner versus geosynthetics because of greater thickness and the ability to withstand settlement  b can be constructed to allow relatively uniform leakage rates to facilitate groundwater recharge but not to an excessive degree that overloads karst bedrock  c when properly constructed in two or more eightinchto teninch thick lifts rapid movement of surface water clay liner is eliminated rapid leaks can occur in geosyntheticlined basins due to poor seaming punctures or other factors  d cleaningmaintenance of claylined stormwater basins will be easiersafer versus geosynthetic liners which could easily be damaged during maintenance operations  and e the abundance of clayey soils derived from limestone residuum within the spring creek watershed can provide adequate costeffective soil resources for construction of clay liner systems at most development projects however the installation of any lowpermeability clay liner system needs to be carefully controlled and the designer needs to ensure that specifications meet standards to ensure

intended to aid the municipality in protecting community character by separating incompatible uses either within the same zoning district andor between adjacent zoning districts the purpose of the flexible buffer yard requirements is to alleviate problems which could be encountered by a single standard the requirements of this article can reasonably accommodate the characteristics of each site and the range of land uses b procedure the following procedure shall be used to determine the type of buffer yard required between two uses located on separate but abutting parcels 1 step one identify the land use classification of the proposed use and of all existing uses located on separate adjoining lots by referring to the land use intensity classification chart as follows land use intensity classification chart group i agricultural singlefamily detached residential uses nonagricultural residential lot stormwater detention basin group ii publicprivate recreational areas townhouses multifamily housing duplexes churches and other places of worship schools  575111 bellefonte code  575114  land use intensity classification chart group iii all uses not identified in group i or ii if there is a question as to which group a use should be classified under the municipal zoning officer shall determine the group based on the most comparable land use to the use listed in the application for a zoning permit the use group of vacant land adjacent to the site is determined by identifying the leastintensive use permitted within the applicable zoning district 2 step two determine the buffer yard required between uses by referring to the following buffer yard table 1 a the table set forth below displays the range of buffer yard requirements associated with the site use from the use groups found on the land use intensity classification chart at 1 above the letters a d denote the planting plan buffer option set forth in buffer yard table 2 the letter n means that no buffer yard is required buffer yard table 1 land use intensity classification of proposed development land use intensity classification of adjacent lots group i group ii group iii group i n n n group ii b a c group iii d c a 3 step three determine the specific buffer yard to be used based on the options for each buffer yard in the following table buffer yard table 2 a table 2 below displays the range of buffer yard requirements associated with each buffer yard and shows the minimum planting units required per every 100 linear feet of distance along a sites perimeter areas less than 100 linear feet andor fractions thereof are to be landscaped with the corresponding ratio by 100 linear feet rounded up to the nearest whole plant  575114 general provisions  575114  buffer yard table 2 buffer yard
