n special parking studies some of the uses that are listed in table 11800b have nonlinear or widely varying parking demand characteristics accordingly table 11800b indicates that the parking

reserve as a condition of approval of a special study the planning commission may require a reserved open area on the site for additional parking if a there is a demonstrably high probability the use could change resulting in a higher demand for parking  or b the case involves a phased development with the potential for a change in the nature or mix of uses in later phases resulting in a higher demand for parking  or c the variability in the special study justifies the reservation of additional land to mitigate a material risk that the use may be insufficiently parked areas that are reserved or landbanked shall be of appropriate location and dimension to provide for the additional parking by connection to existing parking areas once the project is occupied and well established if there is a surplus of parking the applicant may request approval for additional development capacity and parking using the reserved area 5 the potential parking credits and reductions set out in subsections l credits for onstreet and public parking and m reduction of parking requirements by provision of bicycle amenities below are not available to uses that base their parking on a special study unless the

area within six hundred 600 feet of the boundaries of the parcel proposed for development that are within the same zoning district in which the parcel is located  and p is equal to the total number of unrestricted parking spaces on streets and in public parking lots andor garages that are located within six hundred 600 feet of the boundaries of the parcel proposed for development that are within the same zoning district in which the parcel is located the values for a and p shall be documented by the applicant p reduction of parking requirements by provision of bicycle amenities the planning commission may authorize up to a five 5 percent reduction in the number of required offstreet parking spaces in addition to other potential parking reductions and credits provided under this section for development that provides amenities for bicyclists on the subject property or incentives for bicycle use that are in addition to the required provision of dedicated bicycle parking spaces examples of accommodations that would qualify for the credit include 1 enclosed bicycle lockers  or 2 employee shower facilities lockers and dressing areas q shared parking for mixeduse developments the planning commission may grant reductions in the total number of required parking spaces for mixeduse developments in the commercial c and urban u districts as provided in this subsection as this tends to decrease impervious surfaces and enhance the efficiency of land use by capitalizing on the synergy between varied uses in close proximity that have different peak parking demand periods 1 shared parking table shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when a parcel is occupied by two 2 or more uses that typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same time when any land or building is used for two 2 or more use types that are listed below the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedure a multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use type by the appropriate percentage listed in table 11800d shared parking table for each of the designated time periods do not include parking spaces that are reserved for use by specified individuals eg reserved for dr smith or classes of individuals eg residents only round up all fractions to the nearest whole number b calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five 5 time periods columns the minimum parking requirement is the highest of these sums plus the reserved spaces if any that were not included in the multiplication in the first step c the maximum reduction pursuant to table 11800d shall be twentyfive 25 percent d if an applicant proposes to reduce required parking provisions of subsections l credits for onstreet and public parking andor m reduction of parking requirements by provision of bicycle amenities above these reductions must be applied to one use within the proposed mixeduse development prior to calculating the shared parking reduction 2 special shared parking study as an alternative to the shared parking table methodology above an applicant may propose a special study to document the parking required for mixed uses this shall involve review of the peak parking demand periods for the proposed uses during a 24hour weekday and each weekend day and shall result in a proposed number of parking spaces to accommodate the combined peak hour parking demand the study shall be conducted as provided in subsection n2 above the study shall provide data on a the sensitivity of the proposed uses to change for example a center with no restaurant could have significant changes in parking if a restaurant was added b similar mixes of uses in other areas of the community or surrounding region c degree of variability of parking for individual uses average range and standard deviation 3 design of shared parking where shared parking is implemented a a pedestrian circulation system shall be provided that connects uses and parking areas making it easy and convenient to move between uses b all shared parking shall be located within one hundred fifty 150 feet of any building which it serves
