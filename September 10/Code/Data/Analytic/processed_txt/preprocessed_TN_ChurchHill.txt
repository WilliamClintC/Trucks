existing or proposed surface water runoff drainage facilities other than those required to provide internal drainage within such construction such subdivider developer or improver shall be required to follow the sections hereinafter appearing 2003  14702 offsite drainage plan required each subdivider developer or improver shall submit to the church hill regional planning commission in triplicate an offsite drainage plan which shall be based upon the national method of runoff calculation and the tenyear storm frequency 2003  14703 review by city engineer and planning commission approval after receiving a recommendation from the city engineer the planning commission shall approve or disapprove said plan in the event of disapproval the planning commission shall state its reasons therefore to the applicant the planning commission shall include the following in any approval of offsite drainage plans 1 the offsite drainage plan must be approved by the planning commission prior to the approval of any final subdivision plan 2 the offsite drainage plan must route the storm water run off to an existing or natural water course in such a manner as to prevent damage to downstream property owners 3 a natural or existing water course is defined herein as one where the water has been accustomed to gather andor flow a welldefined channel which frequent running has worked or cut into the soil 4 the applicant landowner shall have the responsibility of securing at no cost to the city such necessary perpetual drainage easements to effectuate the approved plan change 2  1494 5 the planning commission may require the applicant landowner to post a bond with good and sufficient surety to assure completion of the plan 6 the planning commission may impose such other reasonable conditions upon the approval of the plans as recommended by the city engineer 2003  14704 construction of drainage facilities in accordance with approved offsite drainage plan the applicant landowner shall construct the said offsite drainage facilities in accordance with the plans and specifications and pay for all of the other cost of offsite drainage facilities or so much thereof as the city engineer shall direct 2003  14705 alternate method for payment of construction costs for offsite drainage facilities as an alternative method of payment for the cost of offsite drainage facilities the subdivider developer or improver may 1 contribute his prorata share of local funds expended for construction of offsite drainage facilities or contribute his prorata share of local funds estimated to pay for the construction of offsite drainage facilities that controls storm water flow in a designated area or the acquisition of property needed for the addition of such facilities local funds do not include funds received by the city from federal or state government grants 2 the prorata share to be contributed by the subdividers developers and improver shall be calculated as follows 3 drainage areas shall be designated by the planning commission in accordance with sound engineering principles upon recommendation by the city engineer 4 offsite drainage facilities needed to properly control present and anticipated storm water flow in such areas designed by the city engineer in accordance with sound engineering principles taking into consideration among other things the zoning and zoning patterns of the subject drainage area the duration and frequency of rainfall in such area during a storm return period of ten 10 years using us department of commerce curves and statistics and suitable runoff coefficients as determined by the city engineer for the different types of zoning in such areas 5 the total cost of such offsite facilities including land or easement acquisition and any other incidental costs shall be estimated by the city engineer based upon current prices plus a percentage of such cost rise over the ensuing five 5 years such cost rise estimate will be determined by the use of us department of labor consumer price indices to project price increase trends 6 the design and estimated cost of such offsite drainage facilities shall be reevaluated every five 5 years prior to construction any changes in cost estimates shall be reflected by either an increase or decrease in those change 2  1495 prorata shares remaining to be paid a rebate shall be made to those having already contributed their share if a decrease in pro rata share is calculated 7 a construction fund for each drainage area shall be established by the city to which prorata shares shall be contributed by the developer prior to final approval shares paid after construction for an offsite drainage facility shall be based upon actual cost and shall be paid to the city a rebate shall be made to those developers having contributed prior to construction if the actual cost of construction is less than the previous estimate 8 the prorata share of each developer or entity shall be calculated by estimating that portion of the total storm water run off using said offsite facilities which can be attributed to the subject developer taking into consideration the size and type of the proposed development the amount of rainfall anticipated in said development and the appropriate runoff coefficients applicable thereto the cost of enlarged or additional offsite drainage facilities the need for which is created by actions taken by the subdividers developers or improver after cost estimates have been made by the citys engineer shall be borne by such developer 9 the prorata share for construction occurring in an area served by offstreet drainage shall be calculated by estimating that portion of the total storm water runoff using said offsite facilities which can be attributed to the new construction taking into consideration the size and type of the proposed construction the amount of rainfall anticipated in said development the appropriate runoff coefficient thereto and the construction of such offsite drainage facility 10 in determining the prorata share of costs between the developer and the city the city will be responsible for upgrading any existing storm facilities which are owned and maintained by the city of church hill at the time of the formulation of the offsite drainage plan it shall be presumed that such existing facilities will adequately carry storm water runoff from the area assuming no new development it shall be the responsibility of the developer to pay the cost of improving existing storm water handling facilities to the point that such facilities are adequate to handle any and all additional flow which may occur as a result of the development plus any storm water flow occurring on the watershed which is directed into the existing storm water facilities as a result of the new development 2003  14706 engineers report to city once the offsite drainage plans have been approved by the planning commission the city engineer will provide the city an estimated cost of the improvements with a breakdown of the prorata shares as described above the city shall determine whether or not the proposed prorata costs are in order and if such costs are approved will present these costs to the developer the city will provide whenever possible labor and equipment for installation of storm drainage facilities as their prorata share of change 2  1496 the cost hourly rates shall be based upon typical costs in the area and will be updated periodically 2003  change 2  1497 chapter 8 illicit discharge and connection
