nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter general

offense  bwhen the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability c1when language defining an element of an offense that is related to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability the element of the offense is established only if a person acts recklessly 2c1 of this section does not apply to offenses defined in the traffic 3c1 of this section does not relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition incorporated into the offense dvoluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in

nature regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby it is the offenders specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature ba person acts knowingly regardless of purpose when the person is aware that the persons conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature a person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact ca person acts recklessly when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the persons conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature a person is reckless with respect to circumstances when with heedless indifference to the consequences the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist da person acts negligently when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the persons conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature a person is negligent with respect to circumstances when because of a substantial lapse from due care the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist ewhen the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices to establish an element thereof then recklessness knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when recklessness suffices to establish an element of an offense then knowledge or purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element when knowledge suffices to establish an element of an offense then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such element orc 290122  50109 attempt ano person purposely or knowingly and when purpose or knowledge is sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense shall engage in

ordain as follows bfindings of fact 1the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately flood proofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1protect human life and health 2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects 3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 4minimize prolonged business interruptions 5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard 6help

development district pud is to achieve to the greatest possible degree land development that is responsive to the natural and environmental assets and liabilities of a given site the pud provides an alternative zoning category that is intended to encourage imaginative design of development the pud should be a wellintegrated development in terms of major design elements such as roads drainage systems utilities and open space the pud allows greater design flexibility so that natural features may be protected and development concentrated in an innovative and efficient manner  ageneral requirements and pud district designation  subsequent to the approval of the city council the designation of pud may be applied to any existing zoning district with the limitations described herein there are two 2 types of puds  1a pud may be a predominantly residential development and in which case is referred to as a pudrs a pudrs may only be applied to an existing residential district the tract of land proposed to be developed as a pudrs must be owned leased or controlled by one 1 person or single entity and must be at least five 5 contiguous acres in size  2a pud may also be a mixed use development referred to as a pud mx a pudmx may be applied to any existing nonresidential zoning district the tract of land proposed to be developed as a pudmx must be owned leased or controlled by one 1 person or single entity and must be at least five 5 contiguous acres in size upon the approval of the final development plan according to this the official city zoning map shall be amended to designate the property pudrs or pudmx  bpermitted uses  the permitted uses in both the pudrs and pudmx district are as set forth below  1permitted uses  pudrs  an applicant may propose to include any mixture of permitted or conditional uses in any existing residential district as well land uses which are allowed as a permitted use in the g3 district are allowed in the pudrs provided that not more than twentyfive percent 25% of the net acres in the development is devoted to nonresidential uses  2permitted uses  pudmx  an applicant may propose to include any mixture of nonresidential land uses in a proposed pudmx development provided that at least sixty percent 60% of the net acres in the development are devoted to uses permitted in the districts applying to the property at the time of application  cgeneral development standards  the following standards represent broad parameters under which all pud developments must be designed  1central water and sewer facilities  all structures in developments approved as a pud must be served by underground utilities including central or public water and sewer facilities and telephone and electrical systems appurtenances to these systems which can be effectively screened may be excepted from this requirement if the city finds that such exemption will not violate the intent or character of the proposed pud  2development layout and design  the design and layout of all puds shall display excellence in design by properly considering significant site features such as topography natural drainage patterns roadway access and circulation surrounding land uses and general public welfare to result in desirable land development attractive landscaped buffers shall be provided between incompatible land uses and activities a diversification of lot sizes lot widths and building setbacks to allow for a variety of structural design is encouraged  3front side and rear setback standards for perimeter all lots that are located along the perimeter of the pud shall have minimum front side and rear setbacks equal to those that would normally be specified in the zoning district prevailing at the time of application for pud approval or twentyfive feet 25 whichever is greater  4offstreet parking and loading facilities  for all land uses located within the pud the parking and loading standards contained in shall be applied  5height requirements  for each foot of building height over the maximum height regulations specified in the zoning use for which that use is permitted the distance between such buildings and the side and rear property line of the pud project area shall be increased by a onefoot addition to the side and rear yard required in the districts  6minimum lot sizes  lot area per dwelling unit may be reduced by not more than twenty percent 20% of the minimum lot area required in the zoning the developer shall show in order for an increase in density to be allowed that such excess can be absorbed by existing utilities and would not result in an overload of the existing utilities land saved application of a higher density shall be used for common open space and recreational facilities  dresidential pudrs development standards  in addition to the general development standards described in c above residential puds shall meet the following development standards  1clustering residential development and required open space  clustering residential density is encouraged to provide required common open space a minimum of twenty percent 20% of the land developed for residential purposes in a pudrs project shall be reserved for common open space and recreation facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed this required amount of common open space shall be established as common open space under one 1 ownership and provision shall be established for maintenance and care the legal articles relating to any organization of property owners in the development charged with such open space maintenance shall be submitted to the city the city council may require as a condition of final approval any evidence deemed necessary to document that the required common space will remain in its stated condition as long as the development exists including such as legal documents deed restrictions conservation easements etc  2clustering residential density  to achieve a clustering of residential density and to provide for the required common open space the lot area requirements for residential land uses may be reduced from the densities required under the districts applying to the property at the time of application by up to twenty percent 20% the lot width and yard requirements for residential lots may also be reduced as needed to accommodate a variety of structural patterns clustering designs and housing types  3residential dwelling types  along with clustering residential density a pudrs may include a mixture of dwelling types including singlefamily detached dwellings two family units zero lotline units and multiplefamily units provided the maximum densities defined in each existing zoning classification is not exceeded  egeneral pud approval
