the rural landscape they represent are being lost at an alarming rate in connecticut east haddam is among the several towns which have lost valuable farmland to residential development according to the 1950 census of agriculture there were 15615 farms in connecticut using about 40% of the land area in the state 1254144 acres of the 3135360 total by 200 the number of farms dropped to 4191 and 357154 acres during the same period in middlesex county the number of farms had plummeted to 326 from 1039 this was a change in farmland area from 76595 acres to 17806 acres it is interesting to note that in 2007 the number of farms increased to 393 but the amount of land devoted to farming decreased to 16623 acres and the size of an average farm was reduced to 42 acres from 55 acres b agriculture is an important element of the rural character of east haddam it is not difficult to see how far we have come from our early agricultural heritage when one views the many stone walls now mostly shrouded in trees and separating subdivisions these walls are a connection to the many farms that once covered the majority of our town landscape c the importance of agriculture is expressed very well in the publication planning for agriculture farms and farmland remain cornerstones of many connecticut communities linking the past to the future landscape of fields and pastures stone walls and weathered barns shaped by generations of hardworking farm families this landscape cherished by so many is often taken for granted some of its benefits are obvious the bounty of fresh fruits and vegetables in the spring and summer months  pumpkins chrysanthemums and christmas trees in the fall and winter  and milk and dairy products yearround other benefits are less obvious the local revenue and jobs farms provide the recreational and tourism opportunities they create the wildlife habitat and other environmental benefits they offer some benefits are easily quantified  many are not the benefit that may be most valued by connecticut residents  the ephemeral quality of life that farms help to provide  unfortunately sometimes is only recognized after its too late and the last farm in town has disappeared note a publication of american farmland trust and connecticut conference of municipalities d it is therefore incumbent on the town of east haddam to endeavor to preserve protect and promote the few remaining farms contributing to its unique rural character to encourage new agricultural enterprises and to ensure that our community has a local source of food for the future

 finding of fact the flood hazard areas of the town of east haddam are subject to periodic flood inundation which results in the loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community the town of east haddam has voluntarily participated in the national flood insurance program nfip since november of 1979 the nfip is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating community local state and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the nfip the communitys role is of paramount importance property owners are able to receive federallysubsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the nfip  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this regulation is to regulate floodplain development promote public health safety and general welfare and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 to protect human life and health and prevent damage to property  2 to minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities infrastructure and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in the floodplain  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas  7 to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area  8 to prevent increase in flood heights that could increase flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners  9 to ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions  and uzp&zregs2016 110 10 to discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity use or structure outside of the floodplain  objectives in order to accomplish its purposes this regulation includes objectives methods and provisions that 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to flood or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that

all other harvest areas slash severely bent or broken trees shall be dropped andor lopped to a height not to exceed six feet 207 harvest methods because of the wide variation in forest types stand size classes stocking levels and timber volumes which exist in connecticut woodlands there are a variety of methods that can be used either singly or in a combination in harvesting and reforestation to meet the stated purpose these methods include clearcutting with natural reproduction  direct seeding or planting  seedtree cutting  selection cutting including diameter limit harvesting shelterwood cutting and such other methods as shall be consistent with good forestry practice although evenage management is an accepted silvicultural practice particularly with hardwood species its use should be practiced judiciously a clearcut area presents a severe visual impact to those unfamiliar with this harvest method  therefore clearcutting will have the following restrictions  maximum of five 5 acres in size  irregular in shape  avoid linear cutting bounds  soften edges by partial cutting within 50 to 100 feet of clearcut boundaries  screen clearcut areas with border strips along roads trails or other areas of heavy public use  leave ridge tops uncut  these areas are the most visible  in most cases evenaged management may be accomplished cuttings rather than clearcutting 208 fire control considerations access roads and fire lanes will be left clear of slash when a cutting job is completed designated roads will be graded so as to be passable by fire equipment where access road

conservation subdivision 231 findings the commission finds that in some cases the strict adherence to traditional land development and subdivision techniques within the town of east haddam has resulted in i the consumption of areas containing valuable recreational agricultural forest and other unique natural resources ii the construction of extensive roads and other improvements requiring maintenance by the town of east haddam  iii the development of sites without specific consideration of the limitations of or opportunities offered by the existing topographical and soil conditions  and iv the destruction of significant historic sites geological features severe slopes scenic vistas significant stands of trees water courses wetlands wildlife habitat or other areas of environmental value natural beauty or historic interest 232 purpose it is the purpose of this to respond to the foregoing findings by providing an opportunity for the preservation and protection of the town of east haddams natural resources by permitting a transfer of density by way of reduction in the minimum lot size normally required in specified zones for residential development in return for the dedication of designated areas as open space  provided however that the total number of lots in such subdivision does not exceed the number otherwise permitted under these regulations and the east haddam

of land disturbance and grade changes retention of existing natural drainage area and wetlands and use or creation of vegetated islands vegetated medians and vegetated perimeter buffer strips b all stormwater runoff generated from new impervious surfaces or changed habitats in the development shall not discharge stormwater directly into an inland wetland or watercourse without adequate treatment drainage shall be designed such that all surface runoff both piped and overland flow is conveyed vegetated swale vegetated filter strip created wetlands rain gardens detention basins with

consulted for detailed guidance on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater practices f all stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities this shall include but not be limited to i maximizing length of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points of basins pools and ponds ii protection of inlet and outfall structures iii elimination of erosive flow velocities iv provision of underdrain systems where applicable g all stormwater management practices must have a landscaping plan detailing the vegetation to be planted the use of native grasses and small diameter woodstemmed shrubs is encouraged as plantings for all vegetated swales vegetated filter strips created wetlands rain gardens or detention basins with biofiltration from parking h the use of nonstructural best management practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices credit in the form of reductions in the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned use of nonstructural practices that reduce the generation of stormwater from the site these nonstructural practices are explained in detail in the connecticut stormwater quality manual ctdeep and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and can reasonably be expected to remain maintenancefree and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners 284 stormwater management plan requirements the stormwater

adoption of a temporary moratorium amendment to the east haddam subdivision and zoning regulation regulation adopting a temporary moratorium on subdivision applications pursuant to connecticut general statutes 825 and 826 the east haddam planning and zoning commission hereby enacts the following as of the east haddam subdivision regulations and pursuant to connecticut general statutes 82 and 83 the east haddam planning and zoning commission hereby enacts the 5 following as of the east haddam zoning regulations a purpose east haddam has experienced a steady continual growth of residential structures that have lead to the fragmentation of forest areas and have impacted watershed areas the plan of development under policy a encourage residential growth at a slow rate is not being accomplished with the existing regulations under action program 1 the following directive is given  planning and zoning commission continue to reflect and emphasize in its land use policies and decisions the need to manage residential growth in harmony with the natural resource base the fragmentation of forest and loss of important habitats is not in harmony with the nature of east haddam and is not in compliance with the goals of the plan of development east haddam has almost 20000 acres undeveloped and uncommitted acres of vacant land still available for use east haddam will be adversely impacted if these areas are not developed in accordance with current policies intended to minimize topographic disturbances protect surface and subsurface waters preserve wildlife habitats avoid exceeding the capacity of the existing and proposed municipal infrastructure and avoid sprawl the commission therefore finds that a temporary limited moratorium on subdivision applications and approvals is necessary to allow the commission to study and revise its regulations in a manner that will allow the most effective and environmentally sensitive division of land and that will enhance the prospects for the conservation of natural resources and the preservation of open space for the welfare of all east haddam residents and landowners more specifically the commission will review the subdivision regulations in its entirety the zoning regulations that apply to open space subdivisions bulk and density of residential development and sections of the plan of conservation and development which relate to the implementation of these regulations b effective date   the moratorium provided in these of the subdivision regulations and 2310 of the zoning regulations shall take

possible though limitation of land disturbance and grade changes retention of existing natural drainage area and wetlands and use or creation of vegetated islands vegetated medians and vegetated perimeter buffer strips from parking b all stormwater runoff generated from new impervious surfaces or changed habitats in the development shall not discharge stormwater directly into an inland wetland or watercourse without adequate treatment drainage shall be designed such that all surface runoff both piped and overland flow is conveyed vegetated swale vegetated filter strip created wetlands rain gardens detention basins with biofiltration prior or acceptable engineered solutions to discharge into existing wetlands streams ponds or other waterbodies from parking c structural best management practices bmps shall be designed to remove 80 percent of the average annual post development total suspended solids load it is presumed that a bmp complies with this performance standard if

facility maintenance declaration for individuals subdivider hereinafter the declarant has obtain approval of the subdivision hereinafter the subdivision as shown on plans entitled subdivision plan title hereinafter the subdivision plans  and whereas the town of east haddam acting by and planning and zoning commission and in consultation with the connecticut department of environmental protection has determined that the protection of both surface and subsurface water quality in the town requires that stormwater runoff from roofs driveways and other impervious surfaces be treated before being discharged into streams lakes and wetlands  and whereas the treatment of stormwater is achieved by a variety of methods prescribed by the 2004 connecticut stormwater quality manual as amended published by the connecticut department of environmental protection whereas the subdivision plans depict one or many of these stormwater treatment methods depending on the soil and groundwater conditions encountered on each lot  and whereas each of these stormwater treatment systems require regular maintenance in order to operate as designed  and whereas failure of these stormwater treatment systems could result in damage to the lots in the subdivision to downstream owners andor to waters that are used for domestic wells recreation and wildlife habitat  now therefore the declarant creates the following obligations for the protection and maintenance of the stormwater treatment systems on the lots in the subdivision which obligations shall run with the land and be binding on the heirs successors and assigns of the declarant this declaration shall be noticed in each subsequent deed for this property 1 protection and maintenance of stormwater management systems no owner of a lot in the subdivision shall remove any stormwater treatment system or sever reroute or otherwise alter any drainage line leading to such system nor take any other action which prevents water from reaching such system and flowing as designed no less than every five 5 years or upon the change of ownership if less than five years the lot owner shall remove accumulated sediment leaves litter or other material which may have accumulated within stormwater treatment systems 2 access by town in the event of default in the event that any lot owner fails to maintain any stormwater treatment system or alters it so that it cannot operate as designed the town of east haddam shall have the authority but no the obligation to enter onto such lot and perform such repairs or maintenance to the stormwater treatment system as may be required to restore it to proper operation for this purpose the town shall have the right to enter onto any lot with equipment and personnel sufficient to perform the work required and to remove any landscaping accessory structures fences walls or other obstacles which might prevent such access it is the duty of the owner to insure that a viable access to the stormwater treatment system exists on the lot for normal maintenance and repair and in the event that the town performs such work due to the lot owners failure to do so the town shall have no obligation to restore any disturbed areas other than to rough grade and seed such areas before exercising any access maintenance or repair rights under this paragraph the town shall provide written notice at least thirty 30 days before such access such notice to be by certified mail return receipt requested and setting forth the work required to be done if the lot owner performs the specified work at its own cost and expense and notifies the town of its completion the town shall not enter onto the lot unless such work has not been performed fully or correctly 75 3 lien to secure town work in event of default in the event that the town of east haddam performs maintenance repairs or other corrective action due to any action of the lot owner or the failure of the lot owner to perform the maintenance work described in this declaration the lot owner shall reimburse the town of east haddam for the cost of performing said work the town shall notify the lot owner by certified mail return receipt requested and setting forth the work performed and the cost thereof the lot owner shall pay said sum to the town within thirty 30 days of receipt the town may secure the

recharging and purification of groundwater  and to the existence of many forms of animal aquatic and plant life many inland wetlands and watercourses have been destroyed or are in danger of destruction because of unregulated use by reason of the deposition filling or removal of material the diversion or obstruction of water flow the erection of structures and other uses all of which have despoiled polluted and eliminated wetlands and watercourses such unregulated activity has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the environment and ecology of the state of connecticut and has and will continue to imperil the quality of the environment thus adversely affecting the ecological scenic historic and recreational values and benefits of the state for its

environmental protection guide to connecticuts municipal inland wetlands and watercourses agencies draft vernal pool definition  indicators vernal pool1 means a seasonal or permanent2 watercourse3 in a defined depression or basin4 that lacks a fish population5 and supports or is capable of supporting6 breeding and development7 of amphibian or invertebrate species recognized as obligate to such watercourses 1 because the term vernal pool is not entirely accurate some have proposed the use of such terms such as intermittent waterbody ephermeral pool or temporary pool to describe this landscape feature the term vernal pool is used here because vernal means pertaining to spring and it is in the spring that many of the ecologically significant activities take place in vernal pools 2 most vernal pools are seasonal drying out during the hotter summer months but some have been found that remain filled with water all year round or for a set of particularly wet years 3 the term watercourse is used here as it is defined in the connecticut inland wetlands and watercourses act cgs 22a38 as rivers streams brooks waterways lakes ponds marshes swamps bogs and all other bodies of water natural or artificial vernal or intermittent 4 some vernal pool definitions further describe depression and basin as being small as most of the isolated woodland vernal pools are usually less than 100 feet in diameter the word small was excluded here because using this descriptor alone is too vague and including a minimum size may exclude valuable vernal pool habitats found within larger waterbodies additionally a minimum time period for the presence of ponding was not included in this definition due to the difficulty in proving this requirement for regulatory purposes it is assumed that if there is sufficient development of obligate species then the required inundation of water has occurred hydrologic indicators listed in the indirect indicators section can also be used to judge period of inundation based on indicated depths 5 population here is to mean a selfsustaining number of native fish 6 the need to include the phrasecapable of supporting reflects the highly variable nature of vernal pools a limited sampling of vernal pool hydrologic and biological characteristics may not reveal its true identity as a vernal pool due to its seasonal variability shortterm climatic variations or natural population cycles for example it has been observed that particular vernal pools may support viable populations only periodically in a given set of years due to natural population dynamics this capability would have to be determined judgment 7 this definition necessitates that the obligate species reach a development stage more advanced than simply successful breeding ie egg laying this includes reaching the tadpole larval stage or the more advanced juvenile stages of their lifecycle using the word development serves to preclude those situations where prolific and successful breeding takes place in less than ideal habitat ie puddles ruts the root ball and depressions of toppled trees wherein the eggs soon perish due to insufficient hydrology predation temperature or other environmental parameters however as mentioned above in very dry years even true vernal pools may become dry before amphibian development is completed 4 4 a direct indicators the species listed under categories 1 and 2 require vernal pools for successful reproduction they are recognized as obligate vernal pool species they serve as direct indicators for the existence of a vernal pool ecosystem documentation of vernal pool utilization by these species is the most reliable method of identifying vernal pool ecosystems either one of the following categories will confirm the existence of a vernal pool ecosystem category i  vertebrates existence of a seasonal or permanent watercourse in a defined depression or basin that lacks a fish population and shows evidence of breeding andor development8 by any of the following obligate vernal pool breeding species a spotted salamander ambystoma maculatum b jefferson salamander complex ambystoma jeffersonianum x laterale hybrid9 c marbled salamander ambystoma opacum d wood frog rana sylvatica as required by this method of identification evidence of breeding andor development for these obligate species include one or more of the following breeding 1 presence of breeding adults a wood frog  breeding chorus andor mated pairs b obligate salamander  courting individuals andor spermatophores 2 two or more egg masses of any of the abovenamed species development 3 presence of tadpoles or larvae of the above species 4 presence of transforming larvae andor juveniles a wood frog  tail stub event b obligate salamanders  gill remnants evident category 2  invertebrates existence of a seasonal or permanent watercourse in a defined depression or basin that lacks a fish population and contains fairy shrimp anostraca sp or their eggs therein 8 evidence of breeding alone could be used to confirm the existence of a vernal pool if judgment it is determined that the pool would be capable of supporting successful development 9 the hybridization of a jeffersonianum jefferson salamander and a laterale blue spotted salamander provides a particular challenge when applied to the identification of vernal pools for more information on this hybridization phenomenon refer to amphibians and reptiles of connecticut and adjacent regions by michael w klemens a laterale is not included as an obligate species here as in other cases because their breeding habitat requirements are markedly different than a jeffersonianum a maculatum and a opacum klemens points out that a jeffersonianum  a laterale hybrids are far more abundant than either parental species in connecticut 4 5 b indirect indicators10 in the absence of direct indicators typically when the pool may be dry from late summer fall during the winter or when climatic or landscape conditions inhibit the presence of direct indicators the following indirect indicators may be used to gauge the likelihood that a watercourse is capable of supporting obligate vernal pool species to be clear it is intended that these indicators can be used to conclude for regulatory purposes that a particular watercourse is a vernal pool but they cannot be used to absolutely confirm its presence as a developing obligate vernal pool species would the more indirect indicators present especially indirect indicators a d the greater the likelihood that a particular watercourse is a vernal pool capable of supporting obligate vernal pool species existence of a defined depression or basin that exhibits a fingernail clam shells snail shells caddisfly cases diving beetles or evidence of other aquatic invertebrates among the leaf litter b presence of algal strands hanging over branches or siltstained leaves attached to overhanging branches at or below the historic highwater mark of the dry basin c dense wetland plant growth eg buttonbush burreed etc in the interior of the basin or depression d a distinct waterline on the base of tree trunks or shrubs in the basin e discolored waterstained gray leaf letter within the basin as distinguished from the brown leaves on the adjacent upland floor f hummocks supporting moss grass sedges or woody growth along the edge of the basin or depression g unvegetated lowlying area or areas in the basin interior h standing water or ice in the winter items a d are to be considered strong indicators that show a higher probability for the existence of a vernal pool that holds water for a long enough period to support breeding and development of obligate species items e h are indicators that might signify the presence of a vernal pool but do not provide sufficient evidence that the pool holds water long enough to support breeding and development of obligate species 10 these indirect indicators are basically clues that one can use when the direct indicators are absent perhaps due to seasonal constraints shortterm climactic conditions or variations in natural population fluctuations to establish a certain probability that the landscape feature being inspected is a vernal pool the weight that these indirect indicators can receive as evidence to the presence of a vernal pool during the permit process may vary according to the circumstances for instance if it is winter and direct indicators are not present but there are enough indirect indicators present so that the wetlands agency and  or their consultants feel that it is more likely to offer vernal pool habitat during the breeding season the applicant may want to agree with this opinion so that he or she can move forward with the permit process under the assumption that a vernal pool exists otherwise the permit decision may have to be postponed until the breeding season to confirm the presence of obligate species 4 6 appendix
