undeveloped part of the parcel but outside of the proposed area of the subdivision 6 the commission may determine the area to be preserved as open space on the parcel being subdivided in order to a preserve important natural resources b preserve scenic areas c preserve agricultural lands d provide for the establishment of a greenway or e expand adjacent open space areas 7 the ultimate ownership of dedicated open spaces parks and playgrounds  be it the town of east windsor a land trust or a recognized conservation organization  should be determined by the commission on a casebycase basis at

on the parcel being subdivided which should be preserved of land 3 when a fee in lieu of land is accepted by the commission the subdivider may elect at his or her option to pay the fee to the town treasurer prior to filing the approved subdivision with the town clerk 4 if the applicant chooses not to pay the fee prior to the recording of the subdivision then the prorated fee for each lot shall
