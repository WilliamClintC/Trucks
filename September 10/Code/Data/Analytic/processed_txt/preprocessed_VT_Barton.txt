category includes land generally characterized by poor or limited road access lack of public infrastructure thin or poor soils steep topographic conditions and remoteness from existing concentrated settlement the development of lands in this category could cause undue damage to the environment by the extension of roads and public utilities necessary to serve the area further the burden of road or public utility maintenance could become an undue expense to the owner future owner public utilities and the town for this reason the minimum lot size of 10 acres will be larger than any other district the remote district also includes a large majority of the towns wildlife habitat forestry and agricultural resources source protection areas ie wellheads including headwaters of high quality streams and brooks all of these natural resources are best preserved by minimal or limited development the suitability of these areas for development must be demonstrated by the landowner reasonable performance development standards for this district as reviewed use review the resource district category includes most of the southern half of the town around crystal lake wheeler mountain may pond and barton mountain there are also resource district designations around baker pond and the barton and willoughby rivers commercial development on parcels greater than 1 acre and residential

20502 low density purpose the low density district is designed for agriculture and forestry enterprises lowdensity residential development limited commercial development along class 2 highways only and other nonintensive uses of the land low density areas are designated where dwelling units will be placed on lots of at least two 2 acres and will not be provided with municipal sewer or water in the foreseeable future development in this district will be buffered by existing trees and topography so as to promote the current rural setting while at the same time providing an atmosphere of privacy within a reasonable distance to the central more populated areas of the town the low density district is the largest category of land use in the town it includes most of the northern half of the town between the villages commercial development on parcels greater than 1 acre and residential subdivisions of more than 5 lots are regulated by vermont land use permits which require significant

table 20503 medium density purpose the designation of the medium density district hinges primarily upon current availability and the designation of feasible future extensions of sewer and water utilities and proximity to the existing villages of barton and orleans the existing settlement patterns and the transportation networks support denser development in these areas the medium density district will contribute towards the growth of built up areas which have already been developed the areas proposed for this category are those in which municipal sewer and water facilities are most feasible compact development is by far the most economical and efficient method for providing these municipal type services lands in the medium density district are primarily limited to lands adjacent to the incorporated limits of orleans village and barton village as these areas are served by exiting municipal sewer and water or the ability to extend services is reasonable the district extends from each of the village centers making access by walking or bicycling reasonable commercial development on parcels greater than 1 acre and residential subdivisions of more than 5 lots are regulated

patterns facilities and services it is important that industry be located so as to take advantage of investments that have been made over time and take advantage of readily available infrastructure while minimizing potential negative impacts upon other land uses eg residential or commercial uses in permitting industrial uses the benefit to the project area must be weighed against the effects industrial development can have upon the economic balance and character of the community there are existing industrial areas in and near orleans village a continuation of the industrial district is located south of orleans village along route 5 recently there has been a new freight rail siding installed in this area for an agricultural and other enterprises and the towns recycling center is located here as well the orleans industrial park located south and west of route 5 is designated as an industrial area the park is approximately 28 acres in size at present only three established businesses have set up operations within the park the majority of acreage available within the park 228 acres remains vacant it is generally believed that the park has good commercial and industrial potential since it borders upon and has easy access to interstate 91 has good access to public infrastructure and is within close proximity of an established stateowned rail line which runs village since the park is located west of the center of the village it is not contiguous with any residential concentrations within the village local officials and development organizations should increase their efforts to encourage the development of this asset in march 201 the orleans industrial park was designated as a magnet site for the regions official foreign trade zone ftz designation importing
