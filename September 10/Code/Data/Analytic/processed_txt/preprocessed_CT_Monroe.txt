and maintenance of quality landscaping and lighting throughout the town in the protection of property values by preserving existing vegetation ensuring the adequacy and appropriateness of new landscape plantings screens and buffers and minimizing light pollution a the commission finds that quality landscaping and lighting provides many unique services and values to the community landscaping softens the edges of buildings screens undesirable places makes large buildings appear smaller and more human scale assists in maintaining biodiversity and can create places for social gathering vegetation recycles the air and water absorbs pollution and sequesters carbon buffers noise and provides shade aircooling and windbreak protection quality landscaping also helps control flooding and erosion of topsoil provides habitat for birds and other wildlife species buffers and screens incompatible uses provides privacy from visual intrusion light and noise moderates microclimate conditions such as that within paved parking facilities by providing vegetative shading absorption of reflected heat and creation of natural wind breaks improves the quality of the environment enhances property values and beautifies the community which ensures the maintenance of existing community character attributes deemed important to the town b quality lighting minimizes

areas of the town of monroe are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss b statement of purpose 1 objectives it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  g to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions 2 methods of

hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural flood plains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d
