commission upon the request of the town planning commission or board of selectmen the regional planning commission may participate in this process the town planning commission shall hold at least one 1 public hearing within the town on any proposed plan the commission shall make such revisions of such proposed plan as it considers appropriate and shall submit the proposed town plan to the town board of selectmen simultaneously with such submission the commission shall file with the town clerk a copy of the proposed plan for public review adoption not less than thirty 30 nor more than one hundred twenty 120 days after a proposed town plan is submitted to the town board of selectmen it shall hold public hearings on the proposed plan at any time but not less than fifteen 15 days prior to

the final public hearing and shall be effective upon adoption maintenance plans should be reviewed from time to time and may be amended in light of new developments and changed conditions affecting the town a town plan shall expire and have no further force and effect five 5 years from the date of adoption a town may adopt any plan in the form as expired or about to expire and such plan as so adopted shall remain in effect for the next ensuing five 5 years or until amended upon expiration of a town plan under this section all bylaws then in effect shall be and remain in effect valid and binding but no amendment thereof shall be effective unless a plan has been theretofore adopted and is in effect and a planning commission has been theretofore created reference 24 vsa d  implementing the town plan according to the planning and development act any town which has adopted and has in effect a plan and has created a planning commission may implement the town plan by adopting amending and enforcing any or all of the following bylawszoning regulations  subdivision regulations  official map  and capital budget and capital program it can be seen that the town plan is of little value unless it is implemented by the town board of selectmen adopting and enforcing a series of bylaws thus the first step of plan implementation is in the preparation of new or revised development standards including 1 zoning regulations which are uptodate flexible in application and easy to administer 2 subdivision regulations which most effectively consider and provide for problems and service demands brought about by new residential development 3 official map which shows the location and width of rightsofway of all streets and drainageways 4 capital budget and capital program which rationally schedule and coordinate the financing and construction of proposed public works and buildings 5 housing building plumbing electrical and fire prevention codes which require that existing and new buildings meet standards of performance safety and health the full range of these controls should be used by towns to bring about desirable growth patterns private development should be permitted only on the towns terms and should be located in accord with the plan to standards established by the town reference 24 vsa bylaws and 4325 4 and 5 e  regional collaboration towns and their individual planning commissions should work together to solve mutual development problems using the collective resources of the regions regional planning commission local planning commissions should anticipate development and growth problems and develop expertise in handling these situations the strength of the individual town planning commission lies in their overall regional approach thus they should maintain a strong regionwide organization and concentrate on searching for solutions to development problems while working toward their individual town plans reference 24 vsa  ii  development controls a  zoning regulations and zoning map towns may adopt zoning regulations and a zoning map to regulate land development 1 zoning is an exercise of the police power by the town board of selectmen granted by the state legislature 2 zoning is the division of the entire town into districts for the purpose of regulating the a use of land buildings and water b density of population and intensity of use c height bulk construction and maintenance of buildings d area of open space around buildings 3 the zoning regulations consist of two 2 parts a text setting forth the regulations that apply to each different zoning district  and a map showing the location and extent of each zoning district 4 the single most important purpose of zoning and designating different areas of the town into different uses is to prevent incompatible uses from forming adjacent to each other and thus it helps to stabilize and protect property values 5 to be legal the zoning regulations and zoning map must be based on an adopted town plan for the future development of the community 6 zoning is a means of insuring that all essential community uses of land and buildings in the community are properly situated in relation to one another for example that houses and factories are not mixed with each other 7 zoning regulations are designed to control private development as distinguished from public improvements 8 zoning can be used among other things to protect agricultural areas forestry recreational uses and to prevent urban development in natural floodplain areas 9 most zoning regulations have provisions for at least four 4 zoning districtsagricultural or forest  residential  commercial  and industrial each of these districts is exclusive that is in residential districts commercial and industrial development is excluded 10 a characteristic feature of zoning regulations that distinguishes it from most other bylaws is that the regulations differ from district to district rather than being uniform throughout the town 11 zoning is prospective rather than retroactive and therefore cannot be used as a major device for improving existing bad conditions 12 the planning commission advises the town board of selectmen of their recommendations for applications for zoning amendments to either the zoning map or zoning regulations requests for zoning amendments must be considered with regard to the overall town development plan 13 a board of adjustment which may consist of members of the planning commission is established by the town board of selectmen as a quasijudicial body and is charged with carrying out functions granted by the planning and development act  it is not a legislative body 14 the board of adjustment has the following powers a to hear and decide appeals concerning the zoning regulations b to hear and grant or deny a request for a variance due to practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship c to hear and grant or deny a request for a zoning permit d to hear and grant or deny a request for a conditional use permit as authorized under the zoning regulations reference 24 vsa b1 440 and 4461 b  subdivision regulations the town board of selectmen may authorize its planning commission to approve modify or disapprove all subdivision plats of land and approve the development of plats previously filed with the town clerk if such plats are undeveloped under the subdivision regulations within a rural town population less than 2500 such authorization may include the review of plats showing only new streets or highways towns may adopt subdivision regulations setting forth the procedures requirements and specifications for the submission processing and design of plats subdivision regulations must be adopted prior to the exercise of any authority by the town planning commission the purpose of the subdivision regulations is to insure that recognized standards for streets water supply sewage disposal parks and other land or facilities intended to be dedicated to the town are followed so that new development will not endanger public health safety or welfare and that public expense maintaining the development will be kept to a minimum the planning commission may simultaneously with the approval of a subdivision plat modify applicable provisions of the zoning regulations to encourage flexibility of design and development of land in such a manner as to promote its most appropriate use to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities and to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open land this procedure is applicable only to land zoned for residential purposes and results in a number of dwelling units which cannot exceed the number which would be permitted if the land were subdivided into lots conforming to the minimum lot size and density requirement of the zoning regulations through subdivision control the town assures a positive control over future development reasons for subdivision control are 1 to obtain a good development layout which is in harmony with the existing development  2 to insure that the development will be serviced by adequate roads streets utilities drainage and other facilities that are economical to service and maintain  3 to insure that appropriate schools open space and recreation areas are provided and that these have a proper relation to residential development  4 to insure that improvements are installed to serve new residents moving into the development  5 to insure that these improvements are installed at a cost to be borne by the benefited properties and not at general town expense reference 24 vsa also 4401b2 c  official map the planning and development act authorizes a town to adopt and amend an official map the official map shows the location and widths of rightsofway of all streets and drainageways no building or improvement may be constucted within the lines of any streets or drainageways shown on the official map the official map is based upon the most accurate data available as to the location and width of streets and drainageways where questions arise which require more precise determinations of the location of any street rightofway line or drainageway the town board of selectmen shall have a survey prepared of the section in question which may become part of the official map reference 24 vsa b3 and 44224425 d  capital budget and capital program financially it is not possible for taxpayers town government and private interests to translate all plans into community services at the same time therefore priorities must be established and choices madefirst things first these choices are expressed by policy decisions and actions of elected representatives of the town they are scheduled in the capital program the planning and development act authorizes a town board of selectmen to adopt and amend an annual capital budget and a capital program for a period of not less than five 5 years a capital budget lists and describes the capital projects to be undertaken during the coming fiscal year the estimated cost and the proposed method of financing a capital program is a plan of capital projects proposed to be undertaken during each of the following five 5 years the estimated cost and the proposed method of financing and project priority a capital project is 1 any physical betterment or improvement including furnishings machinery apparatus or equipment for such physical betterment or improvement when first constructed or acquired  or 2 any preliminary studies and surveys relating to any physical betterment or improvement  or 3 land or rights in land  4 any combination thereof the capital budget and program is arranged in such manner as to indicate the order or priority of each capital project and to state for each project 1 description of the proposed project and estimated total cost thereof 2 proposed method of financing indicating the amount to be financed by direct budgetary appropriation or duly established reserve funds the amount estimated to be received from federal or state governments  and amount to be financed by issuance of obligations showing proposed type or types of obligations together with the period of probable usefulness for which they are to be issued 3 an estimate of the effect upon operating costs of the town no capital project may be authorized or undertaken unless it is included in the capital program as adopted or amended amendments to the capital program are possible by town board of selectmen action to help ensure that the capital budget and program is used properly as a tool to implement the town plan and to make efficient and effective use of town funds the town planning commission should act as coordinating body for preparation review and recommendation of all suggestions for capital projects reference 24 vsa e  building plumbing electrical housing and fire prevention codes the purpose of building codes is to protect the public against faulty design or construction of buildings the building code must insure that occupants adjoining properties neighbors and general public are protected from the erection of structures that are likely to collapse or lead to unhealthy or unsanitary conditions building codes must also prohibit conditions conducive to fire hazards while the requirements deal with the physical structure of the building they are not limited to new buildings and apply to building repairs and alterations the purpose of the plumbing code is to establish reasonable safeguards for sanitation in buildings and property and to protect the health of the public against hazards of inadequate or unsanitary plumbing installations the purpose of an electrical code is to establish safeguards for the protection of life and property the necessity of enforcing good electrical practices is amply demonstrated by the fact that misuse of electricity is the second leading cause of fire in the united states the purpose of a fire prevention code is to establish safeguards from fire hazard in the construction of buildings to protect life and property it establishes the responsibility of the controlling agencies to protect the public a housing code is adopted by a town to maintain standards of living in existing structures although such code also covers new residential structures the code establishes maintenance standards number of people that may occupy a building and minimum standards related to facilities and equipment bathrooms heating hot running water etc of a residence the building owner is responsible for maintaining a sound building  keeping the structure and property in a clean sanitary and safe condition  and disposing of garbage and rubbish in an approved manner iii  plan objectives this section sets forth town goals and recommends objectives following this section various elements of the plan are inventoried and analyzed and projections and

have created a significant number of jobs in the community the continuing development of the industrial park will hopefully further diversify the towns employment and economic base the following table

a principal occupation in vermont and land is a valuable resource looking at farming trends in barre town one will note there has been a decrease in the number of farms and in the number of cows of course some farms have grown larger but land continues to go out of agricultural production as development of industries services housing and other similar types of land use continues increasing pressure is being felt by the town so that less and less of our better farmlands are available for farming the potential of the soils in barre town for farming have been rated based on the categories of highest good low and limited use out of a total of 19328 acres 5000 acres 26% is classed as highest potential for agricultural  2947 acres 15% is good potential  1240 acres 6% is low potential  the remaining acres are in the limited category this is not to say that some farming does not take place on the poor soils but that they are more difficult soils to use for agricultural purposes oftentimes prime agricultural soils are most conducive to development by identifying the prime soils hopefully consideration will be given to preserving the better farming lands and encourage development on other than our best agricultural soils the community is at present basically agricultural and ruralresidential with some industrial and a small amount of service and retail business as in the case in nearly all municipalities within the central vermont area residential property continues to be the largest contributor to the tax base the following table reflects this fact in barre

community the town has experienced steady suburban growth the older communities in the town evolved during the nineteenth century and were closely related to the granite industry these communities being upper and lower graniteville upper and lower websterville east barre and south barre all in the southeastern part of the town these older communities contain large older homes the majority of the multifamily dwellings and neighborhood convenience stores and facilities more recent residential development has taken place adjacent to the city boundary at richardson road beckley hill camp and cassie streets and trow hill and in the southerly end of route 14 in south barre the most recent development residential and industrial has taken place in the lower websterville area with the wilson industrial park being located there the granite quarries found in barre town are a significant land use and represent an important base to the towns economy the quarries are concentrated in the millstone hill area of the town although residential uses are found surrounding the quarries much of the surrounding mineral rights are owned by the granite companies and should be considered in any future land use planning the agricultural land in town has been rated as to its usefulness for agricultural purposes the active farms in town are located on the west hill beckley hill east hill lowery road and lower websterville e  future land use the plan for future land use is depicted on the map which follows land use is classified into six 6 primary use categories and described below for each category is the purpose or intent for designating the category and the policies which should be implemented of land use regulations 1 medium to high density residential land designated for this use is presently or is expected to be in the future served by municipal sewerage facilities and in most instances by municipal water supply facilities development permitted in these areas should be required to connect to public facilities and further development should be restricted from unserved areas until such time as public facilities are installed by either the town or a developer because these areas are served by public facilities a higher density of residential use would be acceptable 2 low density residential the large portion of the town designated for this use is not particularly suitable for other uses such as commercial or industrial and due primarily to topographic conditions these areas are not expected to be served by public sewer or water facilities within the foreseeable future the area would however be suitable for low density residential use agricultural use recreation etc controls on minimum lot sizes large enough to support use of subsurface sewage disposal systems for a prolonged period and regulations on installation of such systems should be developed to maintain public health standards concerning both residential categories consideration should be given when developing zoning regulations to permitting certain compatible uses such as a neighborhood grocery store within a residential area it would also be wise to include within any regulations a provision for planned developments which would allow clustering of development and preservation of common open space 3 commercial areas designated for commercial use are generally level have good access by highway and are within existing or proposed water and sewer service areas the existing commercial service areas are located naturally in close proximity to the higher density residential areas or where highway access is particularly favorable it would appear given recent growth trends in the town that additional commercial activity could be supported by the town as shown on the land use maps 4 industrial a sizeable portion of the town is designated for industrial use which includes all phases of the granite manufacturing industry other types of industrial uses generally require level acreage with good access by highway or rail service which accounts for the remaining areas shown on the map it is recommended that in controlling industrial uses the town generally permit light industrial uses but that heavy industrial uses be regulated with respect to acceptable performance standards in designing regulations attention should also be given to the special types of waste generated by some industries 5 conservation two 2 areas are designated for conservation use which implies very low intensity uses such as agriculture forestry very large lot residential etc the first area encompasses the watershed within barre town of the orange reservoir and the second encompasses the watershed of pecks pond as time passes it will become increasingly important for the town to protect existing and potential water supplies 6 public land the final category of use shown on the map is all existing land controlled by public or community organizations these lands include such uses as town administration schools cemeteries fire stations etc editors note the official map referred to in this section is not printed herein but is on file in the office

substantially the objectives of this ordinance 2 each and every modification variance or waiver of the rules and regulations provided in this ordinance sought by a subdivider shall be specifically applied for in the numerical order as found in this ordinance in writing by the subdivider at the time of presenting the plans any condition shown on the preliminary or final plan which would require a modification variance or waiver shall constitute a ground for disapproval of the preliminary or final plan unless a written request for such a modification variance or waiver is accompanied with the plans 3 if a discrepancy should exist between the subdivider conceptual plan preliminary plan and the final subdivision plan the data contained in the final subdivision plan shall take precedence c standards for granting a variance waiver or modification of the rules and regulations 1 there are unique physical circumstances or conditions including irregularity narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property 2 if granted will not result in a change of the intent of the use of the land in the designated zone 3 if granted will represent the minimum variance waiver or modification that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the subdivision regulations and the municipal plan 4 if granted will not create or extend a burden on municipal services including municipal utilities  1 amendments previously approved subdivisions no change to a previously approved

definitions adequate capacity capacity is considered to be adequate if the grade of service is p05 or better for a least 50% of the days in a preceding month prior to the date of application as measured using direct traffic measurement of the telecommunications facility in question where the call blocking is due to frequency contention at the antennas adequate coverage coverage is adequate within that area surrounding a base station where the predicted or measured median field strength of the transmitted signal is such that the majority of the time transceivers properly installed and operated will be able to communicate with the base station without objectionable noise or excessive biterrorrate for digital and without calls being dropped in the case of cellular communications in a rural environment this would be a signal strength of at least 90dbm it is acceptable for there to be holes within the area of adequate coverage as long as the signal regains its strength further away from the base station the outer boundary of the area of adequate coverage however is that location past which the signal does not regain affiliate when used in relation to an operator another person

a viewpoint the width of the view corridor depends on the focus of the view the focus of the view may be a single object such as a mountain which would result in a narrow corridor or a group of objects such as a downtown skyline which would result in a wide corridor panoramic views have very wide corridors and may include a 360 degree perspective although the view corridor extends from the viewpoint to the focus of the view the mapped portion of the corridor extends from the viewpoint and is based on the area where base zone heights must be limited in order to protect the view whip antenna a vertical antenna that normally transmits signals in 360 degrees whip antennas are typically cylindrical in shape narrow less than 6 inches in diameter and long often measure 18 inches in height or more also called omnidirectional stick or pipe antennas code comparative table  ordinances this is a chronological listing of the ordinances of the town used in this or superseded laws and
