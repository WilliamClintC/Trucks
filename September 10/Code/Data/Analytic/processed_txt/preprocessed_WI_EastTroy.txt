section to regulate obscenity since nudity in and of itself is not obscene it declares its intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of live totally nude nonobscene erotic dancing

prostitution and other sexrelated offenses as well as other crimes and offenses  b the potential depreciation of property values in neighborhoods where bars and taverns featuring nude dancing exist  c

minimize prevent and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the village of east troy  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight 9 the village board has determined that enactment of an

the general policy of the village of east troy that new users connecting to the wastewater collection system reasonably participate in the cost of the villages existing wastewater facilities at the time their properties actually receive sanitary sewer service in determining what constitutes reasonable participation toward such cost the village shall be guided by the principle that the area to be served shall bear its proportionate share of such costs the costs of the wastewater facilities in which new users are required to participate are a costs incurred that are reasonable and necessary to construct the wastewater facilities to serve the new areas  and b costs of providing excess capacity in the wastewater facilities until such time as the future users in the new areas connect to the sanitary sewer system 2 wastewater facilities have a significant physical life this requires that they be constructed with sufficient capacity to serve present users and future users it is economical to construct wastewater facilities with excess capacity therefore it is reasonable that future users as well as present users pay the total cost of the wastewater facilities that serve them the investment in excess capacity is made for the future users benefit and is not available for other uses by the village because future users make no payment until they connect to the sanitary sewer only a part of the total cost of the wastewater facilities can be collected when said facilities are first placed in service accordingly the cost incurred at the time of initial construction of the wastewater facilities associated with provision of capacity for future users should be recovered from said users connection fee 3 this connection fee is enacted pursuant to  4 of the wisconsin

construction in accordance with sound conservation practices possibly including the preservation of trees by well islands or retaining walls whenever abutting grades are altered pursuant to a landscaping plan filed by the subdivider a purpose 1 the village board hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of this chapter to condominium developments the state legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium 2 the factor that makes this chapter applicable to a condominium development is the creation of multiple distinct property entities at or near the ground surface subject to property taxation as separate parcels with each property entity having different ownership and management the village of east troy determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar both physically and in ownership from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership management and control 3 thus the village board hereby finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which are characterized by division of land into lots these impacts include a additional population density b possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the lands characteristics c additional demands upon village area parks recreation areas utility facilities and schools d additional traffic and street use  4957 east troy code  4958  b portions of chapter applicable to

vii density and intensity  51049 purpose this article regulates the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this chapter in order to protect and enhance the desired community character of the village of east troy the purpose of this article is to indicate the maximum permitted density for residential projects and maximum permitted intensity for nonresidential projects of development on any given site within the jurisdiction of this chapter this article is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the village of east troy comprehensive plan many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility andor the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources any nonconforming situation lot use structure andor site shall adhere to the provisions of  approach  51051 natural resources site evaluation a the approach employed by this article considers both the development potential of a given lot as well as the natural resources requiring protection and preservation located on the site and applies the following methods to ensure a high degree of site design flexibility and the protection of community character and natural resources 1 maximum gross densities mgd 2 minimum green space ratios gsr 3 minimum landscape surface ratios lsr 4 floor area ratios far b the development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors including but not limited to 1 area of the site 2 proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources 3 zoning districts in which the site is located 4 development options the site is developed under 5 uses considered for development  51049 general provisions  51051   51052 instructions to determine density and intensity this article in conjunction with the density and intensity regulations included in articles iii iv and v contains the standards which determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site this article recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners a purpose an important goal of the village of east troy is to protect natural resources that are sensitive to disruption caused by development andor other land use activities these resources include floodways floodplain areas floodfringe shorelands wetlands lakeshores steep slopes and woodlands these resources serve important functions which are lost in the absence of correct mitigation approaches when these areas are subject to development andor other land use activities in many instances these functions cannot be provided by other natural or manmade features specific broad categories of such functions include the protection and enhancement of air surface water groundwater and soil quality  habitat provisions and diversification  aesthetic diversification  and buffering effects b natural resources site evaluation worksheet this worksheet is intended to determine which areas of a site are considered natural areas requiring protection and preservation and which areas are most suited for development327 a instructions to determine density and intensity are applicable to both residential and nonresidential development 1 the villages comprehensive plan should be reviewed for implications related to the subject property particularly the future land use and transportation maps 2 the villages official map should be reviewed for planned capital facilities and dedication requirements including schools parks stormwater management facilities and street improvements which may affect the subject property 3 the amount and type of development any given site may contain is directly related to the zoning district in which the site is located the current zoning designation as depicted on the official zoning map should be compared with the description of that district provided in 4 the effect of protected natural resources on the development potential of the subject property should be evaluated a natural resources site evaluation worksheet see  51051b above should be completed for the site all resources listed should be identified 327 editors note the natural resources site evaluation worksheet is included as an attachment to this chapter  51051 east troy code  51052  on the subject property and the total area of the property in acres covered by those resources resource protection areas rpa should be determined as should the gross site area gsa and the net developable area nda of the subject property b the following instructions apply only to residential development in addition to 1 4 above the following steps shall be completed to determine residential density 1 determine the types of dwelling units permitted on the subject property by checking the zoning district in articles iii iv and v provides detailed descriptions and regulations for each dwelling unit land use type 2 check the minimum site area msa requirement against the gross site area gsa of the subject property refer to articles iii iv and v as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in 4 above if the gsa is less than the msa required by the selected development option then a different development option must be selected or additional property should be acquired 3 determine the maximum gross density permitted on the site the maximum gross density per the zoning district of the subject property see articles ii iii iv and v should be noted and used in 4 below 4 determine the maximum number of units permitted on the site the maximum gross density identified in 3 above multiplied by the gross site area calculated in 2 above equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the subject property under the selected development option within the zoning district of the subject property the ability to actually develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not guaranteed by the provisions of this article inefficient site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a lower number of units actually fitting on the site 5 check the minimum lot area mla requirement of the subject property refer to articles iii iv and v the mla must be equal to or less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit proposed for the project in 1 above if the mla given in the zoning district is larger than the lot size requirement given in 1 then a dwelling unit type with a larger lot size must be selected in which case it may be advantageous to repeat 1 5 using a different dwelling unit type c the following instructions apply only to nonresidential development in addition to 1 4 above the following steps shall be completed to determine nonresidential intensity 1 determine the types of land uses permitted on the subject property by checking the zoning district in articles iii iv and v  general provisions  51052  provides detailed descriptions and regulations for each land use type 2 check the minimum lot area requirement against the gross site area present on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in 4 above if the gsa is less than the mla required by the zoning district then additional property should be acquired in other words the gsa must be greater than or equal to the mla 3 check the minimum landscape surface ratio lsr requirement refer to articles iii iv and v against the required resource protection area rpa present on the subject property the lsr should be multiplied by the gsa used in 2 above the resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space this area should be compared with the required rpa on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in 4 above if the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required then more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the site in other words if the rpa is greater than the lsr the use of more floors may permit the development of more floor area on the subject property 4 determine the maximum floor area ratio far permitted on the site which is calculated by dividing the total floor area of all buildings on a site by the gross site area see maximum floor area ratio this number will be used in 5 below 5 determine the maximum floor area permitted on the site the maximum floor area ratio far identified in 4 above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in 2 above equals the maximum square footage of gross floor area permitted on the subject property within that zoning district the ability to actually develop this amount of floor area is not guaranteed by the provisions of this article inefficient site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a smaller amount of area actually fitting on the site 6 check the maximum building size mbs requirement indicated in articles iii iv and v if the mbs given in articles iii iv and v is smaller than the proposed building size calculated in 5 above then a smaller building must be built or the use of additional buildings should be considered  51052 east troy code  51052

square footage of the existing structures andor outdoor storage areas less than 50% of the existing structural andor outdoor storage area within any continuous fiveyear period shall require a corresponding percentage increase in compliance with the site improvements required by this chapter until the site achieves 100% compliance example a property with a permitted expandable use currently has only 50% of the required landscaping an addition to the structure equaling 20% of the combined area of the existing structures and outdoor operationsstorage uses on a site is proposed therefore as a condition of approval an additional 20% of landscaping required for the whole site must be added in this instance 70% of the landscaping requirement would be met upon completion of the improvements b complete replacement of existing structures or expansions of the existing structures that result in a total of 50% or greater increase of total gross square footage within any continuous fiveyear period require the entire property to meet all of the site improvement requirements of this chapter the same requirements also apply to increased or new outdoor areas used for outdoor operationsstorage e on lots where the configuration and undeveloped area of the nonconforming site provide insufficient space to bring the site into full compliance with all site requirements but nevertheless provide space to reduce the degree of one or more nonconformities the plan commission shall make a determination as to the manner and degree to which each site nonconformity shall be brought into conformance  51064 east troy code  51064  article x overlay zoning districts  51065 purpose the purpose of this article is to establish overlay zoning districts wherein certain additional

treatment of a particular land use under the provisions of this chapter if so the written report shall address the following 1 whether the subject land use in general is in harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the comprehensive plan this chapter and any other plan program or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the village 2 whether the subject land use is in harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought 3 whether the potential public benefits of the proposed interpretation outweigh any and all potential adverse impacts of the proposed interpretation f standards for review this chapter shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the village board as noted in this chapter and the comprehensive plan the intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this chapter is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed modified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceed as follows 1 articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation is required 362 editors note amended at time of adoption of see ch 1 general provisions art ii  510151 east troy code  510151  2 before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit discussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated 3 articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in this chapter design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this chapter is to be prohibited 4 determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in the same or greater degree of protection to any affected party ie the adjoining landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this chapter similarly any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this chapter any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this chapter has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements 5 this chapter has been carefully designed by the village board to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options persons interpreting this chapter should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the village board  510151 general provisions  510151  6 in addition to the applicants response to the questions required by above the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters a no interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the village board on an application for an amendment to this chapter or the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation b no interpretation

regulations applicable to development in the subject propertys zoning district see articles iii iv and v d no interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category see articles iii iv and v e if the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject propertys district than to a use permitted by right then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to  510157 g review by the plan commission 1 within 45 days after
