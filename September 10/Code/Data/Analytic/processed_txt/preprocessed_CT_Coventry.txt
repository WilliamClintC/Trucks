these towns include brooklyn canterbury colchester columbia eastford granby glastonbury franklin hampton lebanon shelton suffield sprague thompson and woodstock a local rtf ordinance reinforces this state statute by emphasizing that a municipality supports local farms and farm businesses and views agriculture as a valued activity in the town they are particularly useful where new residential and commercial development occurs adjacent to active farms while new residences may be drawn by the charm of the rural landscape they soon realize that farm operations create dust odors and noise in reaction to these perceived nuisances nonfarm neighbors may lodge complaints with the town or file lawsuits that can cripple or shut down farm operations a local rtf ordinance may help new residences prepare for living in a farming community additionally local rtf ordinances are more likely to become a matter of public policy within a community and are more easily recognized and administered

community despite future changes in town administration and many encourage new farmers into the community in conjunction with examining local zoning regulations tax policies and supporting buy local

specifications for preliminaryspecifications for preliminary layouts layouts formal formal subdivision plans and plansubdivision plans and planprofilesprofiles revised  effective  preliminary review a preliminary review option the commission hereby establishes an optional preliminary subdivision review process to be called preliminary review in these regulations in a preliminary review a prospective future subdivision application may be submitted to the commission for informal nonbinding review and comment in order to commence the preliminary review process the prospective applicant must submit to the commission a letter requesting such review together with a preliminary layout as described in below the commissions preliminary review of a subdivision plan and any comments that may be made by any members of the commission during such preliminary review shall be for informal guidance purposes only and shall not be binding with respect to any aspect of the plan during any later formal subdivision application b purpose and goals of preliminary review in establishing a preliminary review process the commission seeks to enhance the opportunity for an open and creative dialogue with the applicant to better understand the applicants development vision and objectives and to increase the opportunity for coordination with other reviewing agencies and officials as a result of this process the commission may have the ability to reduce the formal requirements for final subdivision review thereby reducing the costs and burdens on the applicant and to better manage and reduce the time required for processing a final subdivision application i enhanced dialogue and coordination a formal final subdivision application requires the commission to consider the towns interest in protecting the publics health and safety  the provision of adequate facilities for water sewerage and drainage  the need for a harmonious adequate and convenient system of streets open spaces parks and playgrounds  and other interests as set forth in of the connecticut general statutes and other applicable provisions of state law in addressing these varied issues the commission may have a substantially different view from a subdivision applicant of the optimal manner in which a parcel of land should be divided and public facilities provided the preliminary review process allows a prospective applicant and the commission an opportunity to share their respective goals and visions at an early stage before the applicant has invested heavily in detailed plans the commission believes this process will lead to better subdivision design and will reduce the likelihood of a contentious or unnecessarily protracted formal subdivision process with its inherent costs and delays  of 57 ii reduction of formal application requirements in order to properly address these many interests and concerns the commission must ordinarily require the applicant to provide a wide variety of information and data because of the relatively short statutory deadlines for processing a formal subdivision application the applicant may be forced to choose between 1 providing expensive but ultimately unnecessary information to the commission or 2 failing to provide sufficient information for the commission to approve the application the preliminary review process is a means for the applicant and the commission to discuss the types and range of information the commission is likely to need for a formal subdivision application during a preliminary review the commission may be able to determine that it would not need certain types of information for final review thereby minimizing the chances that the applicant will incur unnecessary costs or delays in the final review process

shall approve a proposed lot line revision unless it determines either i that one or more of the proposed reconfigured lots would not meet any applicable requirements of the zoning regulations or ii that the proposed modification would result in a lot or lots that would be significantly more difficult to develop or use because of the location of such physical features as wetlands watercourses or steep or rocky areas within the reconfigured lot or lots lot line revisions in other lots the revision of lot lines for adjoining legally existing lots that predate the enactment of subdivision regulations in the town of coventry or that were lawfully created without subdivision approval shall not be deemed to be a subdivision and shall not require the review or approval of the commission

purpose the subdivision design standards set forth in this chapter are intended to fulfill the requirements of a19 of the connecticut general statutes and specifically to assure that land to be subdivided is of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health or the public safety  that proper provision is made for water drainage and sewerage and in areas contiguous to brooks rivers or other bodies of water subject to flooding that proper provision is made for protective flood control measures  that proposed streets are in harmony with existing or proposed principal thoroughfares shown in the towns plan of conservation and development especially in regard to safe intersections with such thoroughfares and are so arranged and of such width as to provide an adequate and convenient system for present and prospective traffic needs  that reasonable provision is made for the creation maintenance and preservation of open spaces parks and playgrounds  and that the design of any subdivision does not unreasonably pollute impair or destroy or create an unreasonable risk of polluting impairing or destroying the public in the air water or other natural or historic resources of the state application of standards a manner of application the standards set forth in this chapter elsewhere in these regulations and in the current plan of conservation and development shall be considered by the commission in determining whether to approve modify and approve or deny any subdivision or resubdivision application the commission may modify a proposed subdivision plan in any manner it determines to be reasonably necessary to achieve compliance with such standards such modifications may include without limitation the adjustment of proposed lot lines  the adjustment of the locations or dimensions of proposed streets rightsofway utilities or other improvements  or the provision or the adjustment of the proposed location of any openspace area park or playground such modifications may also include the elimination combination or merger of specific lots on the proposed subdivision plan if the commission deems such modifications necessary to avoid unreasonably adverse impacts to specifically identified natural or historic resources or to avoid specifically identified health or safety hazards to landowners pedestrians drivers or other persons making proper use of any land within the area of the subdivision b limitation of modifications for purposes of a the term specifically identified shall apply only to natural resources historic resources or health or safety hazards that are specific to the subdivision application and land being reviewed for example the commission may order the elimination or merger of a specific lot that is proposed to contain an inordinate percentage of inland wetlands or that would require a driveway to enter a road at a point with particularly difficult sight lines however the commission may  of 57 not require a general reduction in the overall lot density on the basis of generalized health safety or environmental reasons if the lot density as proposed is consistent with the requirements of the current zoning regulations public health standards the standards for the protection of public health shall be as set forth in of these regulations entitled water supply and sanitary waste disposal standards for open spaces parks and playgrounds the standards for the provision of adequate open spaces parks and playgrounds shall be as set forth in of these regulations entitled open spaces and recreation areas standards for street design the standards for the provision of adequate access and street systems include those set forth in of these regulations entitled required street improvements and design criteria in addition the commission shall apply the following standards a all streets in a proposed subdivision plan shall be designed to allow their incorporation into a safe practical and effective town street and highway system for example when a subdivision is planned within an area of the town that is largely undeveloped or sparsely developed the commission shall consider whether any proposed culdesacs would compromise the towns ability to provide for as the area becomes more densely developed b street layouts shall be designed with reasonable consideration for future access to adjoining parcels of land culdesacs shall be disfavored if adjoining undeveloped parcels should be more easily and practically developed by a road connection and if the use of culdesacs would be likely to require emergency vehicles to traverse a substantially longer route to reach adjoining properties c in approving a subdivision application the commission may require the dedication of land along existing town streets if necessary to provide the street rightofway with an adequate width amended effective  standards for protection of natural resources the commission may modify a proposed subdivision plan prior to approval if it deems such modificationss necessary to protect specifically identified natural resources such as but not limited to  of 57 1 inland wetlands or watercourses and their riparian zones  2 habitat of rare or endangered plant or animal species  3 significant stands of mature trees or particularly large or unusual trees  4 significant geological features such as unusual rock outcroppings  5 vista points and undisturbed ridgelines  6 floodplains  and 7 highyielding or potentially highyielding aquifers standards for protection of historic resources the standards for the protection of historic resources shall include those standards set forth in of these regulations entitled sites of archaeological significance in addition the commission may modify a proposed subdivision plan prior to approval if it deems such modifications necessary to protect specifically identified historic resources such as but not limited to 1 stone walls or fences  2 foundations or other evidence of historic settlements within the town  3 native american or other burial grounds  and 4 historic structures or landmarks as defined by a of the connecticut general statutesamended effective  5 a subdivisions shall be designed to preserve all existing stone walls b all existing stone walls that are required to be removed shall be reused elsewhere on the property

commission consider a conventional subdivision plan as an alternative to an open space subdivision plan the applicant must request a waiver of the open space subdivision requirement pursuant to in such situations the applicant must submit both an open space subdivision plan and the proposed alternative conventional subdivision plan so that the commission may compare and contrast the two in light of the open space preservation policies set forth in these regulations the alternative conventional subdivision plan must conform to all other requirements contained in these regulations and the

consideration of the best form of subdivision for any parcel the commission recommends that prior to the submission of an official application for subdivision approval the applicant utilize the preliminary review option set forth in of these regulations general density limitations except as otherwise provided in these regulations the maximum number of lots for an open space subdivision shall be determined at the applicants option by either the formula method or the yield plan method a formula method if the applicant chooses the formula method the maximum number of lots shall not exceed the number resulting from dividing the total area of the parcel subject to the exclusions stated hereafter by the minimum lot size that would be permitted for a conventional subdivision in the applicable zoning district the total area of the parcel as measured for purposes of this section shall exclude the following i land that is not buildable land as defined in of the zoning regulations and ii existing and proposed streets and highways easements and rightsofway for vehicular access and utilities b yield plan method if the applicant chooses the yield plan method the applicant must provide a preliminary conceptual subdivision plan consisting of lot and street layouts conforming to the zoning and subdivision regulations governing conventional subdivision lots although such yield plans shall be conceptual in nature and are not intended to involve significant engineering costs they must be realistic and must not show potential house sites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional subdivision layout consequently yield plans must identify physical and other features that would limit or restrict the use of the parcel for development including but not limited to topographic contours at a contour interval of no more than ten 10 feet  wetlands and watercourses  100year floodplains flood zones a as shown on fema maps  slopes exceeding twentyfive percent 25%  rock outcrops  and easements and rightsofway affecting the parcel on lots that would not be served by public sewerage or a centralized private sewage treatment facility soil suitability for individual septic systems must be demonstrated the commission may select a small percentage of lots 10 to 15% to be tested in areas considered to be marginal if all tests on the sample lots meet applicable public health the applicants other lots shall also be deemed suitable for septic systems for the purpose of calculating total lot yield however if any of the sample lots fail several others of the commissions choosing shall be tested until all the lots in a given sample pass density bonuses in accordance with the zoning regulations the maximum number of lots allowed under of these subdivision regulations may be increased in one of the following ways  of 57 a open space maintenance fund the commission may allow a density bonus to generate additional income to the applicant for the express and sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing open space maintenance costs the density bonus granted under this subsection shall be limited to fifteen percent 15% of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under of this any such density bonus shall be conditioned upon the provision by the owner of the parcel to be subdivided of an agreement to pay a fee into an open space maintenance fund to be established and maintained by either i the town of coventry or ii the organization to be charged with the maintenance of the open space provided in the applicable subdivision plan the amount of the fee shall be set by the following formula cfmvn x 05 xl where cfmv is the cumulative fair market value of all of the buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision n is the total number of buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision and xl is the number of additional lots allowed by the density bonus the value of cfmv shall at the option of the applicant be i the 100% value of all of the buildable lots or parts as determined by the town assessor for tax purposes as of the effective date of the subdivision approval or ii determined by a licensed connecticut real estate appraiser chosen jointly by the applicant and the commission in which case the applicant shall be responsible for any appraisal fees b other open space dedications a density bonus may be granted for the provision of excess open space meaning the amount of any open space acreage that is greater than the minimum amount that would be required under this the additional open space may be within the parcel to be subdivided or elsewhere within the town of coventry for each five acres of excess open space accepted by the commission one additional building lot shall be allowed up to a maximum of fifteenpercent 15% of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under of this the decision whether to accept an applicants offer to dedicate excess open space shall be at the discretion of the commission which shall be guided by the recommendations contained in the towns plan of conservation and development and its determination as to the value of the excess land for any of the purposes described in of this c encouraging affordable housing a density bonus shall be allowed for open space subdivisions that provide affordable housing as defined in g of the connecticut general statutes for each affordable housing unit provided under this section one additional lot shall be permitted up to a maximum of fifteen percent 15% of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under of this affordable housing is herein defined as units to be sold or rented to families earning 70120 percent of the county

percentage of land that shall be designated as permanent open space shall be as required under of the coventry zoning regulations  of 57 b use of open space areas at least twentyfive percent 25% of the minimum required open space shall be suitable for active recreation purposes but no more than fifty percent 50% shall be utilized for that purpose in order to preserve a reasonable portion of natural areas on the site the purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant the required open space may be used without restriction for underground drainage fields for individual or community septic systems provided that no portion of such systems protrudes above grade stormwater management ponds or basins may be included as part of the minimum required open space as may land within the rightsofway for underground utility lines however land within the rightsof way of overhead power lines or other surface utility lines shall not be included in the minimum required open space in determining whether the proposed locations and uses of openspace areas are acceptable the commission shall consider the potential impacts on nearby properties and on the neighborhood design standards for open space subdivision the dimensional requirements for lots in an open space subdivision shall be as specified in the coventry zoning regulations in designing an open space subdivision the applicant should consider the purposes set forth in of this the provisions and standards set forth in of these regulations and the following factors as set forth in the zoning regulations a dwelling units shall be grouped allowing a portion of the parcel to remain open b the open space in any open space subdivision shall be located entirely within the subdivision and

the development in relation to the open space by first 1 locating the proposed open space  second locating houses  third locating roads  and fourth laying out lot configurations d to the greatest extent feasible lots shall be laid out to achieve the following objectives listed below in order of priority as it is recognized that some may conflict with others on any given site 1 to place septic systems on the most suitable soils for subsurface wastewater disposal in unsewered areas only  2 within any woodland contained in the parcel or along the far edges of the open fields adjacent to any woodland to reduce impact upon agriculture to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind and to enable new construction to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features  3 in locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic vistas as seen from the public roadways   of 57 4 on the least fertile soils for agricultural uses and in a manner that maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural use  5 in locations where the greatest number of units could be designed to take maximum advantage of solar heating opportunities e wherever possible wetlands should be adjacent contiguous or included in the open space f along any part of the parcel perimeter where downsized lots abut normalsized lots the commission may require a buffer zone up to fifty feet in width thickly planted with fastgrowing native shrubs and trees or may require in such buffer zone the maintenance of existing natural vegetation g unless prevented by ledge or other natural restraints underground utilities shall be required in open space subdivisions h proposed lots and improvements should be designed and situated to minimize alteration of the natural site features to be preserved i proposed open space areas should include irreplaceable natural features located in the tract such as but not limited to stream beds prime farmland agricultural soils significant stands of trees individual trees of significant size and rock outcroppings j open space intended for recreation or other active public use should be easily accessible to pedestrians including to the extent feasible the handicapped and elderly k individual lots should be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding properties to improve the view from and the view of prospective home sites and to minimize the area devoted to motor vehicle access and travel the commission may modify any application so as to designate open space in locations other than those proposed if it determines that such modified locations will better serve the purposes and satisfy the applicable criteria and standards of these regulations and the zoning regulations dedication of open space a method of dedication the commission shall determine the most appropriate method of disposition after considering among other things the relationship of the subject areas and its specific characteristics to the plan of conservation and development and the objectives cited in of these regulations  the desirability and suitability of public access and use  and the scope of the subdivision proposal the following disposition options may be utilized by the commission 1 perpetual dedication to the town 2 perpetual dedication to the state of connecticut for open space or recreational purposes  of 57 3 perpetual dedication to a land

proposal 1 the increase in the burden imposed by the proposed open space subdivision on existing and proposed areas of open space 2 any relevant recommendations of the town council the inland wetlands agency the parks and recreation commission the conservation commission the board of finance or any other public or private agencies or authorities regarding the most appropriate disposition and management of the open space 3 the level of access to the areas of open space proposed to be afforded to members of the general public 4 the manner in which the association would manage the open space and the extent to which proper management would be assured  in approving any proposed dedication of open space to an association or corporation the commission may set additional requirements to assure the proper and continuing management and oversight of the open space including but not limited to the following 1 creation of the association or corporation prior to the sale of any lot  2 mandatory membership in the association or corporation by all original lot owners and any subsequent owner  and 3 requiring the association or corporation to have the power to assess and collect from each lot owner a specified share of and where necessary provide reserves for the costs associated with maintenance repair upkeep and insurance of the open space  of 57 exceptions an applicant may apply to the commission for an exception to the open space subdivision plan requirements the purpose of the exception is to provide flexibility with regard to parcels of land for which an open space subdivision play would be impractical due to existing physical conditions or limitations would create an undue hardship or would be substantially detrimental to the charter of or property values in surrounding areas in evaluating approving or disapproving an application for such an exception the commission may consider the following criteria a the nature of the proposed development b the nature of the resources present on the land c the size of the subdivision d road access e the shape of the parcel f any undue hardships that the creation of an open space subdivision would cause  and g any other

rear lots under two circumstances when a new rear lot is created by the first division of a parcel of land subsequent to the date of adoption of subdivision regulations in the town of coventry the commission may approve the use of such lot by the issuance of a special permit the commission may also approve the creation and use of a new rear lot as part of a subdivision approval in either instance the commission in determining whether to grant approval for the creation or use of a new rear lot shall apply the criteria for the issuance of a special permit as well as the standards and criteria in these regulations the commission may approve the creation or use of a new rear lot only if it finds that the lot would help provide a more appropriate development of the land compared to a development without such lots by better protecting or utilizing the natural resources of the site or of surrounding property  allowing better traffic sight lines at driveway entrances and exits  facilitating control of drainage erosion or sedimentation  or allowing visual buffering that better protects the character of or improves privacy in the neighborhood in making this determination the commission may consider the topography of the land natural resource conditions and characteristics drainage and traffic impacts the configuration of the lot and surrounding lots or parcels driveway sightlines and utility service capabilities and other factors that may potentially affect the public health safety welfare and property values lot standards and criteria each new rear lot must have the following characteristics a public utilities must be installed underground within the lot unless the commission determines that soil bedrock or groundwater conditions are such that installation would not be feasible or appropriate such utilities shall not be installed under a travelway unless necessary and shall be installed after the travelway has been graded but before the base material or pavement is installed b the accessway must be at least twentyfive 25 feet in width and the applicant must demonstrate to the commissions satisfaction that a driveway could be feasibly designed and constructed in the accessway when the construction of such a driveway would require one or more activities regulated by the coventry inland wetlands and watercourses agency the applicant must demonstrate to the commissions satisfaction that such a driveway could be feasibly designed and 18 constructed within the accessway any person wishing to reserve the right to subdivide or resubdivide a rear lot must provide an accessway at least fifty 50 feet in width in order to assure that sufficient land is available to create a highway rightofway to provide access to the additional lots any applicant proposing to create or use a new rear lot having an accessway less than fifty 50 feet in width must submit a written waiver signed by both the applicant and the owner of the affected property containing the following language revised effective  the undersigned applicant acknowledges that a rear lot having an accessway less than fifty 50 feet wide may not be capable of further subdivision or resubdivision under the coventry zoning and subdivision regulations the regulations the applicant further acknowledges that hisherits as appropriate application to create such a rear lot is voluntary and the applicant waives any right to demand to be allowed to divide the rear lot in the future unless such division can be made in conformance with the regulations c the accessway must be an integral part of the lot and may not be owned separately from the remainder of the lot except as provided below no accessway may be used for vehicular access to more than three lots d each driveway or other interior travelway must be laid out and designed to provide suitable access to emergency vehicles including but not limited to fire trucks and ambulances see driveway regulations in  the layout and design of the rear lots should occur in a manner to avoid excessive stacking of rear lot driveways where numerous abutting rear lot driveways are created in succession the applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating such suitability by sufficient evidence from appropriately trained persons who may include but are not limited to the coventry fire marshal however any applicant proposing a rear lot shall do so at his or her own risk and shall assume all responsibilities and liabilities for the design construction maintenance and repair of such driveway or travelway neither the town the commission nor or any town official or employee shall be responsible or liable in any manner for such driveway or travelway revised  effective  e the area of the accessway and of any other portion of the lot not meeting the minimum width requirements set forth in table 404a shall not be counted as part of the required minimum lot area of approval in addition to such other conditions as may be allowed under these regulations the commission is authorized to condition the approval of a new rear lot on a fixed designation of the specific areas in which the house septic system and driveway or other interior travelway will be located and on the details of construction of such travelway rear lots that are not defined as new rear lots pursuant to be used in accordance with the provisions of of these regulations 19 dimensional standards requirements except as these regulations may otherwise expressly provide all uses and structures shall comply with the standards set forth in table 404a frontage and width except as may otherwise be expressly provided in these regulations no building permit or zoning permit shall be issued for any building structure or use unless the lot for which the permit is sought has the required lot frontage and width lot frontage shall be measured on an existing street or a street under construction as shown on a properly approved and filed subdivision plan or other plan approved by the commission corner lots shall be deemed to have two front yards and lot frontage requirements must be met along or in the direction of all street lines the minimum lot width shall be maintained from the building line to the rear setback line on lots other than corner lots on corner lots the minimum lot width shall be maintained from the building lines on each street to the side setback lines area a basic requirements the required minimum area of a lot as established by these regulations must be in contiguous land and shall be measured exclusive of any accessway in addition for the purpose of determining minimum lot area or parcel size and maximum lot coverage in all zones and districts all of the following shall be excluded 1 areas that are submerged during the mean annual high water level of watercourses as defined by conn gen stat  in zoning districts for which the minimum lot area requirement pursuant to is 40000 square feet or less fifty percent 50% of the areas defined as inland wetlands or watercourses by conn gen stat  in zoning districts for which the minimum lot area requirement pursuant to is greater than 40000 square feet twentyfive percent 25% of the areas defined as inland wetlands or watercourses by conn gen stat b multiplication factors for property on substandard roads the commission finds that the maximum densities of development ie minimum lot sizes otherwise permitted under these regulations are appropriate only for property abutting roads that meet current town standards for width pavement and drainage since those standards are intended to protect public health and safety and since greater development densities both cause and allow greater traffic volumes the commission further finds that the maximum allowable densities should be reduced ie that minimum lot sizes should be increased along existing roads that do not meet the current town standards therefore the minimum lot areas shown in table 404a must be multiplied by the following adjustment factors for each of the following circumstances 20 circumstances adjustment factor frontage on unpaved streets 13 frontage on streets that do not meet current town standards for drainage improvements 13 frontage on streets that do not meet current town standards for the width of the travelway the portion of the street actually used for travel 13 the foregoing adjustment factors shall be applied cumulatively for example a lot having frontage on an unpaved town street that lacks proper drainage must have a minimum lot size that is 13 x 13   169 times greater than the minimum lot size shown in table 404a c applicants option to improve road an applicant for subdivision or development of property having frontage on a road that does not meet current town standards for width pavement or drainage may at his or her option propose to improve that portion of the road abutting that property as a condition of subdivision or development approval any proposal to improve an existing road must be presented to the public works director for review and possible approval prior to the filing of the subdivision or development application upon the approval of the public works director of any such proposal for improvement to the portion of the road abutting the property to be subdivided or developed the applicant shall be entitled to propose minimum lot sizes as though the road were already improved to the extent permitted by the connecticut general statutes and the town subdivision regulations the commission may require as a condition of approval of any such subdivision or development that a bond or other surety be provided to ensure that the road improvements are completed as proposed d increased lot size for twofamily multifamily and farm uses for twofamily or multifamily dwellings in the gr and vr zones must have 15 times the minimum lot area otherwise required by these regulations

one inch 1 of rainfall from any precipitation event will be collected and returned to the ground by an appropriate device or devices such as but not limited to infiltration basins or trenches rain gardens or inground perforated chambers the approval of any such increase in lot coverage shall be deemed to be conditioned on the maintenance of such structures in the event that the applicant fails to maintain such structures after approval of any such increase in lot coverage the commission or zoning enforcement officer in addition to any other remedies provided by law may issue an order to the landowners requiring without limitation 1 that the structures be maintained repaired or replaced  or 2 that the landowners reduce lot coverage to no more than 10% as an example of the implementation of the foregoing provisions and for purposes of additional clarity only the following scenario is given  lot area 40000 square feet  10% maximum lot coverage allowed as of right under table 404a 4000

sufficient to return at least 1240 gallons of water to the ground during any one precipitation event the foregoing determination may be made by either the commission or the zoning enforcement officer upon advice of the town engineer in the event the commission or zoning enforcement officer issues any permit or approval allowing lot coverage to be greater than 10% in the lake residential lr zone

increased control in the development of land so as to facilitate the preservation of open space natural resources recreational uses and community character density limitations except as otherwise provided in these regulations the maximum number of units for an open space subdivision shall be determined at the applicants option by either the formula method or the yield plan method a formula method if the applicant chooses the formula method the maximum number of lots shall not exceed the number resulting from dividing the total area of the parcel subject to the exclusions stated hereafter by the minimum lot size that would be permitted for a conventional subdivision in the applicable zoning district the total area of the parcel as measured for purposes of this section shall exclude the following i land that is not buildable land as defined in of the zoning regulations and ii existing and proposed streets and highways easements and rightsofway for vehicular access and utilities 30 b yield plan method if the applicant chooses the yield plan method the applicant must provide a preliminary conceptual subdivision plan consisting of lot and street layouts conforming to the zoning and subdivision regulations governing conventional subdivision lots although such yield plans shall be conceptual in nature and are not intended to involve significant engineering costs they must be realistic and must not show potential house sites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional subdivision layout consequently yield plans must identify physical and other features that would limit or restrict the use of the parcel for development including but not limited to topographic contours at a contour interval of no more than ten 10 feet  wetlands and watercourses  100year floodplains flood zones a as shown on fema maps  slopes exceeding twentyfive percent 25%  rock outcrops  and easements and rightsofway affecting the parcel on lots that would not be served by public sewerage or a centralized private sewage treatment facility soil suitability for individual septic systems must be demonstrated the commission may select a small percentage of lots 10 to 15% to be tested in areas considered to be marginal if all tests on the sample lots meet applicable public health the applicants other lots shall also be deemed suitable for septic systems for the purpose of calculating total lot yield however if any of the sample lots fail several others of the commissions choosing shall be tested until all the lots in a given sample pass bonuses the maximum number of lots allowed under may be increased in one of the following ways a open space maintenance fund the commission may allow a density bonus to generate additional income to the applicant for the express and sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing open space maintenance costs the density bonus granted under this subsection shall be limited to fifteen percent 15% of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under any such density bonus shall be conditioned upon the provision by the owner of the parcel to be subdivided of an agreement to pay a fee into an open space maintenance fund to be established and maintained by either i the town of coventry or ii the organization to be charged with the maintenance of the open space provided in the applicable subdivision plan the amount of the fee shall be set by the following formula cfmvn x 05 xl where cfmv is the cumulative fair market value of all of the buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision n is the total number of buildable lots or parts resulting from the subdivision and xl is the number of additional lots allowed by the density bonus the value of cfmv shall at the option of the applicant be i the 100% value of all of the buildable lots or parts as determined by the town assessor for tax purposes as of the effective date of the subdivision approval or ii determined by a licensed connecticut real estate appraiser chosen jointly by the applicant and the commission in which case the applicant shall be responsible for any appraisal fees b other open space dedications a density bonus may be granted for the provision of excess open space meaning the amount of any open space acreage that is greater than the minimum amount that would be required under this the additional open space may be within the parcel to be subdivided or elsewhere within the town of coventry for each five acres of excess open space accepted by the commission one additional building lot shall be allowed up to a maximum of fifteen percent 15% of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under the decision whether to accept an applicants offer to dedicate excess open space shall be at the discretion of the commission which shall be guided by the recommendations contained in the towns plan of conservation and development and its determination as to the value of the excess land for any of the purposes described in c encouraging affordable housing a density bonus shall be allowed for open space subdivisions that provide affordable housing as defined in g of the connecticut general statutes for each affordable housing unit provided under this section one additional lot shall be permitted up to a maximum of fifteen percent 15% of the total number of lots that would otherwise be allowed under affordable housing is herein defined as units to be sold or rented to families earning 70120 percent of the county median income adjusted for family size as determined by the us department of housing and urban development space percentage and use limitations a minimum percentage of open space the minimum area of open space to be dedicated within an open space subdivision shall be forty percent 40% of the total area of the parcel being subdivided in addition the area of open space to be dedicated must contain at least forty percent 40% of the total area of the parcel that does not comprise wetlands watercourses or floodplain areas as an example if a parcel containing 100 acres is subdivided and 30 acres of the parcel consists of wetlands watercourses or flood plain areas the minimum openspace dedication will be 40 acres 100 acres x 40 and at least 28 acres 70 acres x 40 of the dedicated area must not be wetlands watercourses or flood plain areas nothing in this section shall prohibit a subdivider from dedicating additional land consisting of wetlands watercourses or flood plain areas so long as the minimum amount of other types of land is also provided for instance in the example given above the subdivider could dedicate 20 acres not just 12 acres of wetlands so long as the dedication also included the minimum 28 acres of land that did not consist of wetlands watercourses or floodplain areas the commission encourages subdividers to dedicate or otherwise preserve as much of the wetlands watercourses and floodplain areas as possible b use of open space areas the purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant the required open space may be used without restriction for underground drainage fields for individual or community septic systems provided that no portion of such systems protrudes above grade stormwater management ponds or basins may be included as part of the minimum required open space as may land within the rightsofway for underground utility lines however land within the rightsof way of overhead power lines or other surface utility lines shall not be included in the minimum required open space standards a dimensional requirements the dimensional requirements for lots in an open space subdivision shall be as follows minimum lot area 25000 square feet minimum lot frontage 100 feet 25 feet for rear lots minimum front yard 50 feet minimum side yard 20 feet minimum rear yard 50 feet maximum lot coverage 15% rear lots shall contain no less than 35000 square feet excluding the area of the accessway and shall have a minimum driveway access width of twentyfive 25 feet all lots in an open space subdivision shall comply with the minimum buildable area requirements set forth in except where the lots isare to be served by a community septic system in conformance with all department of environmental protection and state public health requirements b other design standards in designing an open space subdivision the applicant should consider the purposes set forth in the following factors 1 dwelling units shall be grouped allowing a portion of the parcel to remain open 2 the open space in any open space subdivision shall be located entirely within the subdivision and shall be in one contiguous piece unless the commission finds that the purposes of be more effectively served by separated parcels the open space shall have suitable shape dimension character and location to promote the purposes specified in  when designing an open space subdivision the applicant must refer to the towns open space plan and plan the development in relation to the open space by first 1 locating the proposed open space  second locating houses  third locating roads  and fourth laying out lot configurations 4 be laid out to the greatest extent feasible to achieve the following objectives listed below in order of priority as it is recognized that some may conflict with others on any given site a to place septic systems on the most suitable soils for subsurface wastewater disposal in unsewered areas only  b within any woodland contained in the parcel or along the far edges of the open fields adjacent to any woodland to reduce impact upon agriculture to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind and to enable new construction to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features  c in locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic vistas as seen from the public roadways  d on the least fertile soils for agricultural uses and in a manner that maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural use  e in locations where the greatest number of units could be designed to take maximum advantage of solar heating opportunities 5 wherever possible wetlands should be adjacent contiguous or included in the open space 6 along any part of the parcel perimeter where downsized lots abut normalsized lots a fiftyfoot buffer zone thickly planted with fastgrowing native shrubs and trees may all be required or an already forested strip or natural vegetation may be accepted at the discretion of the commission revised  effective  7 unless prevented by ledge or other natural restraints underground utilities shall be required in open space subdivisions 33 8 proposed lots and improvements should be designed and situated to minimize alteration of the natural site features to be preserved 9 proposed open space areas should include irreplaceable natural features located in the tract such as but not limited to stream beds significant stands of trees individual trees of significant size and rock outcroppings 10 open space intended for recreation or other active public use should be easily accessible to pedestrians including to the extent feasible the handicapped and elderly 11 individual lots should be arranged and situated to relate to surrounding properties to improve the view from and the view of prospective home sites and to minimize the area devoted to motor vehicle access and travel the commission may require the subdivider to refer any proposed open space subdivision to a professional landscape architect for review comment and modification the commission may modify any application so as to designate open space in locations other than those proposed if it determines that such modified locations will better serve the purposes and satisfy the applicable criteria and standards of these regulations and the subdivision regulations in making such determination the commission may also consider i the ownership of any existing open space on adjacent properties or the proximity to nonadjacent open space which might reasonably interconnect with the proposed open space in the future  ii the proposed use of the open space for active or passive uses and the extent of maintenance supervision or management required  iii the potential benefits which the open space might provide to residents of the town or the state if it were accessible to them  iv the size shape topography and character of the open space  v the recommendations of the coventry plan of development and the coventry open space plan  and vi the reports or recommendations of any state regional or town agencies and officials of open space a method of dedication the commission shall determine the most appropriate method of disposition after considering among other things the relationship of the subject areas and its specific characteristics to the plan of conservation and development and the objectives cited in   the desirability and suitability of public access and use and the scope of the subdivision proposal the following disposition options may be utilized by the commission 1 perpetual dedication to the town 2 perpetual dedication to the state of connecticut for open space or recreational purposes 3 perpetual dedication to a land trust at the option of the subdivider as long as the land trust has agreed to accept the dedication 4 dedication to a homeowners association for open space or recreational purposes 5 utilization of conservation easements with or without public access 6 utilization of a recreation easement to the town state or a private nonprofit entity 34 7 utilization of an agricultural use restriction easement to the town state or a private nonprofit entity 8 private ownership for open space purposes with the appropriate taking of development rights 9 any combination of the above or any suitable alternative approved by the commission any
