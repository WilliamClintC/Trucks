in loss of life or property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities and b the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages this section uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps aselection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this section is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this section it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated by applicable flood insurance studies and the federal emergency management agencys flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway map or any subsequent effective flood insurance studies rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps issued after the effective date of the zoning adopted by the city of nevada bcalculation of water
