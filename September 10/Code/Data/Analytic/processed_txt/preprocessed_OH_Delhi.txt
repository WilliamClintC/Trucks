ohio 150 zoning resolution delhi township ohio 151 addendum 1 statement of intent and findings related to sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments i purpose and intent 1 a in initiating amendment zc20161to the zoning resolution the zoning commission makes the following statement of intent and findings 1 adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from the public safety agencies of delhi township in order to protect and preserve the health safety morals and welfare of the patrons and employees of the businesses as well as the citizens of delhi township 2 the zoning commission finds that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 3 the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of delhi township that demands reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by delhi township in the specified manner and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by local governments in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens 4 there is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment establishments because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them cause increased crime particularly in the overnight hours and downgrade property values 5 the zoning commission desires to minimize and control these adverse effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner and by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects the zoning commission seeks to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight 6 the zoning commission has determined that current local zoning and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of delhi township and that expanded regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary 1 this was adapted from the purpose and intent version included in the model sexually oriented businesses prepared by the attorney general per the general assemblys directive in hb no 23 2006 and sb no 16 2007 zoning resolution delhi township ohio 152 7 it is not the intent of the zoning commission in making its recommendations regarding codification of the plan to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact contentneutral statutes that address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments 8 it is not the intent of the zoning commission to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and the zoning commission recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this state b it is the intent of the zoning commission in adopting the motion to regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of delhi township and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments within delhi township the provisions of this motion have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent of the zoning commission in enacting this motion to restrict or deny or authorize the restriction or denial of access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny or authorize the denial of access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of the zoning commission in enacting this motion to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene material c based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on communities

acknowledgement of the same the zoning commission finds 1 adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments 2 certain employees of adult entertainment establishments as defined in delhi zoning resolution as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adult entertainment establishments especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows the couch dances or lap dances that frequently occur in adult entertainment establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may constitute the offense of engaging in prostitution under of the revised 4 offering and providing private or semiprivate booths or cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments zoning resolution delhi township ohio 154 6 numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis salmonella campylobacter and shigella infections chlamydial myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections trichomoniasis and chancroid 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 198 and 253448  8 a total of 10255 aids cases had been reported in ohio as of january 1999 ohio has required hiv case reporting since 199 and the reported information shows 7969 people living with hiv 4213 and aids 3756 in the state 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in ohio 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the unites states reported annually has risen 33613 cases were reported in 198 and 45200 cases were reported  11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse and exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 the findings noted in divisions c1 to 14 above raise substantial governmental concerns 16 adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that require or mandate reasonable government regulation in order to protect those
