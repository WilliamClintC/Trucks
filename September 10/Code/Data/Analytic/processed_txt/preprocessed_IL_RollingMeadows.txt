footage of the benefitted properties outside the subdivision to determine a gross amount due from each property d while the developers sanitary sewer installation allows outside property owners to connect to the sanitary sewer in the future the future customers will still have to extend the sewer mains additional distances to account for their needs the value of this additional work is subtracted from the gross installation cost to develop a net eligible cost for each parcel 2 water main a property that will or can be served by an extension of the water main system is determined b the total front footage of all of the benefitted properties is determined c the actual cost for the installation is used up to three percent of such costs may be included for engineering the cost for

values trees need sufficient soil water and air to survive protecting existing natural resources and planning for the establishment and care of new trees will enhance the economic and environmental health of the city the purpose of this article is to promote and protect public health and safety by providing for the proper establishment of new trees the protection and maintenance of existing trees and the timely removal of hazardous or undesirable trees  882000 goals the provisions contained in the city designed to yield specific goals when properly implemented these goals include 1 maintain a healthy urban forest the urban forest of the city is a dynamic ecosystem comprised of trees soil water air wildlife and humans proper stewardship of the ecosystem is the most efficient and economical method of ensuring a safe and relatively hazardfree environment for the citizens of rolling meadows 2 promote age and species diversity of the tree population the longterm health of city urban forest depends on a proper distribution of young middleaged and mature trees adequate stocking of variously aged trees ensures that as mature trees decline and are removed younger trees are available to fill in the canopy species diversity is also important to guard against substantial losses to a speciesspecific pest or disease such as dutch elm disease 3 improve species and site selection for new tree plantings increasing species diversity will only improve the urban forest if the species are matched with the site in which they are growing large trees provide the greatest benefits relative to energy conservation  air quality and storm water retention but require sufficient space to reach their full size at maturity small trees can be used in a variety of places that are size restricted however if a space will accommodate a tree that achieves a larger size at maturity the largergrowing species should be considered the proper tree should be located according to the conditions of the site with consideration given to increasing canopy closure maximizing environmental benefits and achieving consistency in the landscape design 4 establish optimum canopy closure trees help to conserve energy by providing shade to buildings during the summer additional cooling can be realized by shading roads and parking lots that would otherwise absorb sunlight and radiate heat since the city is located in a climate where considerably more energy is spent on heating than cooling consideration must also be given to the effect of shade on heating costs in the winter careful consideration of the establishment of new trees will result in the optimum canopy closure relative to energy conservation 5 resolution and prevention of treehardscape conflicts planning trees require space for roots trunk and branches frequently the space occupied by portions of trees is needed for other elements of the infrastructure such as roads sewers utility lines and buildings conflicts between trees and other infrastructure components can be minimized of the various city departments local utility companies and citizens the provisions of this article are intended to facilitate communication and cooperation between those individuals and agencies charged with maintaining the citys infrastructure 6 provide attractive and aesthetically pleasing transportation routes and open space the city recognizes the benefits associated with the development of shade provided by trees along motor vehicle and bicycle routes in the community the shade provides a cooling effect which encourages physical activity manifested by walking jogging and bicycle riding in addition the beauty of a tree canopy adds charm and attractiveness to residential and commercial settings 7 promote public education and support the primary reason to care for trees and natural resources in the city is to improve the community for its citizens the urban forest management program must be based on the informed support of the citizens a goal of this article is to provide proper tree care professional management based on knowledge those city employees responsible for the management of
