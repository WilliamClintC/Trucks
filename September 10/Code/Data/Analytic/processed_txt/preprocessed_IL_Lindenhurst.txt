intent and purposes of this the village board does hereby establish the written rules and regulations as to minimum engineering standards governing the design construction and maintenance of storm water detention systems including requirements as to type of materials methods of installation maximum permissible rates of discharge and other engineering parameters 2 no building permits shall be issued in unsewered areas or separate sewered areas when construction of the facilities would result in runoff in excess of that from its natural or undeveloped state unless the runoff rate from the area be restricted to be no greater than that from its natural or undeveloped state and that detention space for the excess storm water be provided in accordance with the engineering requirements of this shall also be made for the proper maintenance of any such detention facility 3 it is the intent of division d2 above to have the developers use discretion in providing detention storage area and wellmaintained landscaped lakes would provide an aesthetic focal point in any shopping area or residential area as well as a mutually acceptable method of providing storm water detention areas other methods to regulate the rate of storm water discharge which would be acceptable include detention on flat roofs parking lots lawns underground storage etc all with properly designed restricted outlets to the receiving storm sewer or stream 4 a combination of storage and controlled release of storm water runoff is required for all commercial developments exceeding 3 acres in area and for all residential developments exceeding 5 acres in area the release rate of storm water from all developments requiring detention shall not exceed the storm water runoff rate from the area in its natural undeveloped state the village will accept the release rate of not greater than that calculated from a storm of 5year frequency with a runoff rate coefficient of 015 unless the applicant can show by his detail calculations which are acceptable to the village that the discharge rate of the natural outlet channel serving the area is greater drainage systems shall have adequate capacity to bypass development the flow from all upstream areas for a storm of 5year frequency assuming that the land is in fully developed state under present zoning or zoning proposed under a comprehensive plan the bypass flow rate shall be computed using a runoff coefficient of not less than 035 an allowance will be made for upstream detention when such upstream detention and release rate has previously been approved by the village and that evidence of its construction can be shown 5 the live detention storage to be provided will be calculated on the basis of the 100year frequency rainfall as published by the us weather bureau for this area the detention volume required will be that necessary to handle the runoff of a 100year rainfall for any and all durations from the fully developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir less that volume discharged during the same duration at the approved release rate 6 one method of calculation which will be acceptable and preferred by the village for the determination of the capacity of storm water detention reservoirs is as follows live detention storage   volume runoff 100year  release rate x duration inches   v100qrtd c i100td015i5td maximum storage volume calculated by this equation for any and all duration td will be the required storage the terms of the above equation are defined as follows qr   the maximum release rate in inches per hour from the land in its natural undeveloped state 015   the coefficient of runoff for the undeveloped land i5   the intensity in inches per hours of the rainfall from the us weather bureau curve for 5year frequency for the time of concentration of the undeveloped land i100   the intensity in inches per hour of rainfall from the us weather bureau curve for 100year frequency for any and all durations td   the duration of the 100year storm which must be varied to determine the most critical and therefore maximum required detention c   the coefficient of runoff for the completely developed drainage area tributary to the reservoir note i100 varies with td however i5 is calculated using the longest time of concentration for the undeveloped land and becomes a constant in the above equation the live detention storage in inches of depth can be converted to acrefeet by multiplying the inches of depth by the drainage area acres and by the factor  e the grades of all streets shall not be

general buffer yard requirements  sterling codifiers inc  306360 a general 1 buffer yard standards are listed in this section for peripheral buffer yards and for street buffer yards 2 peripheral and street buffer yard standards are based on a required relative buffer yard intensity value a variety of combinations of buffer yard width planting intensity and structural options ie fences and earthen berms may be selected from  159 table 159 of this part to reach the required buffer yard intensity value 3 peripheral buffer yards must be located along the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel and must extend to the lot or parcel boundary line peripheral buffer yards may not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or rightofway 4 required buffer yard plantings may be planted in natural appearing groupings along the total length of the buffer yard and need not be spaced uniformly along the total buffer yard length b plant materials 1 for each buffer yard listed a specific combination of deciduous canopy shade and understory trees  evergreen trees  and shrubs is required as indicated in  159 of this part 2 all buffer yard areas must be seeded with lawn or native ground cover unless vegetation is already fully established c height of required vegetation height of vegetation selected for required buffer yards will be measured from the highest finished adjacent grade of the element to be screened d berming earthen berms must be designed to transition to existing grades not to exceed a slope ratio of  and must be covered with plant material ground cover or partially riprapped to prevent erosion berms with vegetative cover must be designed to retain irrigation water rather than encourage runoff all earthen berms must be safely designed in order to accommodate mowing when needed e calculation of buffer yard requirements 1 buffer yard requirements are calculated using the standards listed in this  159 for peripheral buffer yards and for street buffer yards as specified in  159 table 159 of this part 2 buffer yard standards listed in this  159 are to be calculated for every 100 linear feet of peripheral lot line boundary andor street frontage present on a given lot 3 in instances where the zoning district boundary andor street frontage is less than 100 feet the required buffer yard planting is 1 plant unit see  159 table 159 of this part 4 to determine the type of buffer yard required on a parcel between 2 parcels or lots or between a parcel or lot and a street the following procedures will be used a procedures for

districts established by this chapter are designed to guide the future use of land within the village by encouraging the development or maintenance of desirable residential commercial office and industrial areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare the continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such districts are established and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable b general scope and scheme of

uses in structures designed for a permitted use the degree of incompatibility is frequently great the investment is comparatively small and the economic life is short in these cases elimination of the nonconformity is required after a relatively short but reasonable amortization period in the case of nonconforming uses in structures not designed for any conforming use the degree of incompatibility is also frequently great but so too is the investment and economic life of the structure in these cases while eventual elimination is required a more extended period is allowed in which to amortize the investment while the regulations of this part related to all other nonconformities allow such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time they restrict further investments that would make more permanent their location in inappropriate districts c exception for repairs pursuant to public order nothing in this part will be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to
