plans for all subdivisions approved after  added 342004  amended 1192006 review scope this reviewapproval process will address drainage and runoff concerns for the lot in question adjacent lots and the subdivision as a whole only the elevation of the foundation is reviewed for comparison to adjacent grades and generally for comparison to adjacent homes this review does not address the constructability of the foundation 1 procedure overview step 1 lot grading plan approval the owners engineer surveyor submits information for review and approval to agawam dpw engineering it is hoped that the owner is part of this process in order to expedite step 2 a step 2 builderowner signoff the owner and builder send a letter to dpw indicating that the approved lot grading plan will be complied with during construction the ownerbuilder signoff including all information shown in the sample letter must be forwarded to dpw within one week after step 1 is complete the white form will be forwarded from dpw to the building department for the building permit after this step is complete b step 3 construction field check the builderowner will contact dpw engineering to schedule a field check on the top of foundation wall to ensure compliance with the approved lot grading plan the fee for this inspection is $70 the builder owner must allow a fortyeighthour window for dpw to perform the field check dpw is available monday 30 am to  pm except holidays the builder will be contacted by agawam dpw with the results of the field check failure by the builder to comply with the approved lot grading plan will result in dpw notifying the planning board the planning board will then request the building department to issue a stopwork order for the lot until a resolution can be agreed
