to permit emergency vehicle access by some practical means as required by the fire department 6 every structure or dwelling unit shall have access to a public street walkway or other area dedicated to common use 7 there shall be provided a pedestrian circulation system insulated as completely as reasonably possible from the vehicular circulation system 8 at least one bicycle rack capable of holding multiple bicycles shall be provided on the site in a safe secure and convenient location the planning commission may waive or modify this requirement if the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that providing a bicycle rack is impractical or is not needed due to the nature andor location of the proposed use 9 all loading and unloading areas and outside storage areas including areas for the storage of trash that face or are visible from residential districts or public thoroughfares shall be screened by a vertical screen consisting of structural or plant materials no less than six feet in height 10 exterior lighting shall be arranged so that it is deflected away from adjacent properties and so that it does not impede the vision of traffic along adjacent streets 11 with respect to vehicular and pedestrian circulation including walkways interior drives and parking special attention shall be given to location and number of access points general interior circulation separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic particularly the avoidance of building corners next to access drives and arrangement of parking areas that are safe and convenient and insofar as practicable do not detract from the design of the proposed buildings and structures and the neighboring properties streets and drives part of an existing or planned street pattern that serve adjacent development shall be of a width appropriate to the traffic volume they will carry and shall have a dedicated rightofway equal to that specified in the citys master plan 12 all public streets shall be built in accordance with the requirements of the city 13 in order to achieve one of the objectives of the hastings area plan which is to provide for a connected system of streets and pedestrian and bicycle trails between neighborhoods and activity centers all site plans shall be designed to provide for the following as may be deemed necessary by the planning commission in order to meet the standards for approval set forth in subsections 90131112 herein a public and private streets shall be extended to the boundary line of adjacent parcels to allow for the logical continuation of such streets into the adjacent parcel this extension may be in the form of constructing the road itself to the parcel boundary or providing a rightofway to the parcel boundary so the road may be constructed at a future date b sidewalks at least five feet wide on both sides of the street shall be installed within the street rightofway for all projects c improved walkways where practicable shall be located along certain side lot lines in order to provide an alternative pedestrian travel route to the sidewalk system located within the public rightofway these midblock walkways shall be

according to the standards of this section relating to vehicle access and circulation the purpose of specific access standards is to increase traffic safety lessen congestion provide adequate access promote community character and ensure orderly development b the planning commission shall have the authority to require a frontage road or service drive for contiguous parcels along m43 and m37 or on other streets as deemed necessary the planning commission shall also have the authority to limit the number of driveways for a site to require that parking lots on contiguous parcels be connected that driveways for contiguous parcels be shared and that opposite driveways be directly aligned in determining whether the above or other access control measures are necessary the following criteria shall be considered 1 the type and location of commercial uses on the site and adjacent to the site 2 the location size and design of existing and proposed parking areas 3 the existing and projected traffic volume on the roadway and adjacent roadways 4 compatibility between adjacent land uses and likelihood of change or expansion 5 number of parcels involved location of lot lines and amount of road frontage 6 topography and site distance along adjacent roadways and on the site 7 distance from intersections 8 location of driveways opposite the site 9 width of roadway and number of lanes 10 environmental limitations steep slopes water or vegetation 11 sufficient building setback c for commercial uses along m37 and m43 and other streets as deemed necessary the following regulations shall apply 1 a parcel shall not be denied reasonable access to a public roadway 2 a maximum of one driveway shall be provided to an individual parcel or to a contiguous parcel under the same ownership when the property in question has no other reasonable access to another abutting street or access road additional driveways may also be permitted in accordance with the driveway spacing standards herein a oneway in oneway out driveway system may be permitted if it is demonstrated that traffic circulation on and off the site will not create hazardous situations 3 temporary direct access to m43 and m37 may be granted in instances where access roads or adjoining parcels are not yet developed a temporary driveway permit shall specify the future means of access location if known and date the change will be made this temporary access agreement shall be recorded with the county register of deeds 4 a parcels with 300 or more feet of road frontage with a single large use will not be required to construct a service drive but may be required to connect the parking area to parking areas on contiguous parcels b if a parcel with an established commercial use and with 300 feet or more of road frontage is divided to allow for an additional commercial use resulting in parcels with less than 300 feet of road frontage an additional driveway for that use will not be permitted both the original and the additional commercial use will be required to construct an adjoining service drive an exception to this standard exists if the anticipated traffic volumes generated by either the original or the additional commercial use will exceed 3000 vehicles per day andor are projected to cause traffic congestion during peak hours c if two or more existing contiguous parcels with noncommercial uses together comprise less than 300 feet of road frontage and if any of those parcels converts to a commercial use or any other use for which site plan review is required the construction of a service drive will be required as additional contiguous parcels convert to commercial uses they will be required to construct additional segments of the service drive these parcels will eventually be served by common driveway access the placement of which will be determined by driveway spacing standards contained herein d driveways for a parcel shall be permitted based on the amount of road frontage for that parcel as follows except that the planning commission may modify this in the interest of public safety based on the criteria in subsection b of this section fro nta ge fee t dri ve wa ys per mit

developed 4 for parcels which are only allowed a channelized rightturnin rightturnout driveway and alternative means of access shared driveway frontage road service drive or connected parking lots are not feasible due to parcel size or existing adjacent development the planning commission may allow a nonchannelized full movement driveway provided that a the driveway is spaced no closer to the intersection than the minimum spacing allowed for a rightturnin rightturnout driveway b a traffic study conducted by a registered traffic engineer provides substantial justification that the driveway operation will not result in conflicts with vehicles at the adjacent intersection f driveway spacing from other driveways shall be determined as follows 1 there shall be minimum spacing of 25 feet between the centerline of a driveway and the adjacent property line not including the right turn lane andor taper the centerline for channelized driveways is measured at the street rightofway line this requirement does not apply to shared driveways 2 minimum driveway spacing requirements shall be determined based on posted speed limits along the parcel frontage as indicated in table 181 table

minimums based on the distances required to avoid conflicts between vehicles turning right or left from adjacent driveways 4 the planning commission shall have the authority to waive or modify the preceding spacing requirements when strict adherence to them would result in unreasonable access to the site in waiving or modifying the spacing requirements the criteria of subsection b of this section shall be used b 21097 performance guarantee a the planning commission may require a performance bond letter of credit or certified check in an amount equal to the estimated cost of road lighting utility sidewalk landscaping drainage and other required improvements associated with the project the estimated amount shall be determined by the director of public services such performance
