of the public and private sectors  b allow developers to proceed under certain conditions notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency by contributing their proportionate fairshare of the cost to improve or construct a transportation facility  c contribute to the provision of adequate public transportation facilities for future growth and promote a strong commitment to comprehensive transportation facilities planning thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion  d maximize the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth and may in certain circumstances allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements program  e ensure that a development is not responsible for the costs of correcting transportation deficiencies prior to the addition of project traffic pursuant to fs  5h3ciib  and f be

establishes the methodology for determining the proportionate fairshare obligation of the applicant a pursuant to fs  5h3 a development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fairshare or cost of reducing or eliminating deficiencies prior to the addition of project traffic the fair market value of the proportionate fairshare mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation b the methodology used to calculate an applicants proportionate fairshare obligation shall be as provided in fs  5h3cii as follows 1 the proportionateshare contribution shall be calculated based upon the number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during the peak hour from the stage or phase being approved divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain or achieve the adopted level of service multiplied by the construction cost at the time of development payment of the improvement necessary to maintain or achieve the adopted level of service 2 in using the proportionateshare formula provided in this subparagraph the applicant in its traffic analysis shall identify those roads or facilities that have a transportation deficiency in accordance with the transportation deficiency as defined in fs  5h3e the proportionateshare formula provided in this subparagraph shall be applied only to those facilities that are determined to be significantly impacted by the project traffic under review if any road is determined to be transportation deficient without the project traffic under review the costs of correcting that deficiency shall be removed from the projects proportionateshare calculation and the necessary transportation improvements to correct that deficiency shall be considered to be in place for purposes of the proportionateshare calculation the improvement necessary to correct the transportation deficiency is the funding responsibility of the entity that has maintenance responsibility for the facility the developments proportionate share shall be calculated only for the needed transportation improvements that are greater than the identified deficiency 3 when the provisions of this subparagraph have been satisfied for a particular stage or phase of development all transportation impacts from that stage or phase for which mitigation was required and provided shall be deemed fully mitigated in any transportation analysis for a subsequent stage or phase of development trips from a previous stage or phase that did not result in impacts for which mitigation was required or provided may be cumulatively analyzed with trips from a subsequent stage or phase to determine whether an impact requires mitigation for the subsequent stage or phase c the context of the term cumulative in subsection 377b includes only those trips from the stage or phase of a development being considered in the application the trips expected to reach the failing roadway for this calculation are those identified in the developments transportation concurrency analysis all assumptions used in the proportionate fairshare calculation shall be consistent with the provisions of the citys transportation concurrency review procedures and the maintenance of the transportation concurrency management system d for the purposes of determining proportionate fairshare obligations the city shall determine improvement costs based upon actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the capital improvements plan cip or the florida department of transportations work program where such information is not available improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods 1 an analysis by the city of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city commission in order to accommodate increases in construction material costs project costs shall be adjusted by the inflation factor established by fdots long term construction cost inflation forecast  or 2 the most recent issue of fdot transportation costs   locally available data from recent projects on rightofway acquisition drainage and utility costs  and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted fdot work program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the fdot district e if the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section f if the fairmarket value of an alternative form of fairshare mitigation is less than the total proportionate fairshare obligation as determined by one of the methods provided in this section the applicant must pay the difference however under no circumstances shall the city approve an application that obligates the city to compensate an applicant for proportionate fairshare mitigation that exceeds the value calculated by one of the methods provided in this section g if the city has accepted rightofway dedication as a form of proportionate fairshare mitigation credit for the dedication of the related rightofway shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 115 percent of the most recent assessed value by the jackson county property appraiser or at the option of the applicant by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the applicant shall supply a certified survey and legal description of the land and certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant must also pay the difference 378 impact fee credit for proportionate fairshare mitigation at which time the city adopts an impact fee ordinance related to transportation facilities the following provisions shall apply a proportionate fairshare contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fairshare mitigation is used to address the same transportation improvement contemplated by a city impact fee ordinance credits will be applied toward the portion of the applicants transportation impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvement on which the proportionate fairshare mitigation is calculated if the proportionate fairshare mitigation is based on only a portion of the developments traffic the impact fee credit will be limited to that portion of the impact fees on which the proportionate fairshare mitigation is based b impact fee credits for the proportionate fairshare contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development impact fees owned by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fairshare agreement as they become due per an applicable cityadopted impact fee ordinance if the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation is less than the developments anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city pursuant to the requirements of the
