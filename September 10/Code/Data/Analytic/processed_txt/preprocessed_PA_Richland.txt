of its citizens  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of blight 2 the board of supervisors has determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 3 the board of supervisors does not intend this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a contentneutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses it is not the intent of the board in enacting this legislation to deny any person rights of speech protected by the constitution of the united states or the constitution of pennsylvania or both nor is it the intent of the board to impose by this chapter any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials including sexually oriented films videotapes books and other materials further by enacting this legislation the board does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view or both any sexually oriented materials or conduct protected by the constitution of the united states or the constitution of pennsylvania or both nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of sexually oriented materials may have to sell distribute or exhibit these materials b legislative findings the board of supervisors finds 1 statistics and studies performed in a substantial number of communities in this commonwealth and in the united states indicate that sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects including those specified and recognized at 68 pacsa  5501a which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare these secondary effects include but are not limited to the spread of communicable diseases performance of sexual acts in public places presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on public and private property sexual harassment obscenity prostitution and other illegal sexual activities crime and neighborhood deterioration 2 sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare 3 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and  711 richland code  711  the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 4 removal of doors on viewing booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths advances a substantial governmental interest in discouraging the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 5 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 6 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business will help limit and control the adverse secondary effects of such businesses 7 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 8 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license or an employee thereof has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 9 the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 10 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the township will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter 11 limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to  am to  pm reduces the adverse secondary effects of such businesses including particularly but not limited to late night noise levels crime and sexually offensive materials and activities in public areas and promotes the public health safety and welfare  711 adult entertainment  711   712 definitions as used in this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the
