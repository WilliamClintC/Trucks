neighborhood district purpose and intent  612005   a this district provides for an urban residential zoning district that is characteristic of the primarily single family residential neighborhoods located in the central area of the city some of these neighborhood areas are truly historic in nature and possess a charm and urban form that is not yet duplicated in other areas of the city this district provides area and height requirements that closely match the status of the existing built conditions it also provides flexibility that allows the existing urban character to remain redevelopment efforts and provides flexibility on a performance basis for limited additional densities and mixture of land uses as is characteristic of vibrant urban neighborhoods and places when it can be demonstrated that potential negative impacts are mitigated and minimized creative site planning and design b there exists an area of hollands central neighborhoods defined as the hope neighborhood area where historically there has been a balance of longterm owneroccupied homes and transitory shortterm student rental homes in the immediate vicinity of hope college and western seminary that has sustained the desire of each population to remain and sustain the neighborhood this area is now being challenged by significant pressures for change in housing stock and density of activity proximity to the college recent student enrollment increases and minimal housing growth coupled with increased deterioration in old housing stock have combined to increase pressure to convert either or replacement longtime singlefamily owneroccupied residential units or properties into shortterm transitory student occupancy with the greatest density of occupancy that ordinances will allow 1 these changes challenge the desirability and sustainability of this neighborhood as a singlefamily neighborhood this has been problematic due to the accompanying high density of individuals often with divergent lifestyles activity patterns and schedules  and an atypically high density of automobile possession and use where need is typically to accommodate one vehicle per occupant thereby increasing noise traffic paving demands and loss of green yard space 2 due to the transitory nature of student housing normally for less than a full twelvemonth period opportunities for developing relationships between shortterm occupants and longterm residents are diminished and the sense of cohesive neighborhood is hard to achieve where there is limited opportunity or effort to establish a sense of belonging to investing in and committing to a cohesive neighborhood charter c1019 permitted uses  612005   3 it is the intention of the city to encourage and sustain opportunities for singlefamily occupancy as a stabilizing force within all areas of this zone district while acknowledging the opportunities under certain conditions to support quality higher density housing such as
