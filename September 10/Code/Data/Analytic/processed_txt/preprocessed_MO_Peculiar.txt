order s rules of order  simple parliamentary procedures for the 21st century  6202016 rosenbergs rules of order are supported by the following four 4 principles rules should establish order the first purpose of the rules of parliamentary procedure is to establish a framework for the orderly conduct of meetings rules should be clear simple rules lead to wider understanding and participation complex rules create two 2 classes those who understand and participate and those who do not fully understand and do not fully participate rules should be userfriendly that is the rules must be simple enough that citizens feel they have been able to participate in the process rules should enforce the will of the majority while protecting the rights of the minority the ultimate purpose of the rules of procedure is to encourage discussion and to facilitate decisionmaking by the body in a democracy the majority rules the rules must enable the  city of peculiar mo ecode360  4639 1 2 b a b c d e f 1 g 1 c majority to express itself and fashion a result while permitting the minority to also express itself but not dominate and fully participate in the process the chairperson should take a back seat during discussions while all members of the governing body should know and understand the rules of parliamentary procedure it is the chairperson chair who is charged with applying the rules of conduct the chair should be well versed in those rules because the chair for all intents and purposes makes the final ruling on the rules in fact all decisions by the chair are final unless overruled by the governing body itself because the chair conducts the meeting it is common courtesy for the chair to take a less active role than other members of the body in debates and discussions this does not mean that the chair should not participate in the debate or discussion on the contrary as a member of the body the chair has full rights to participate in debates discussions and decisionmaking the chair should however strive to be the last to speak at the discussion and debate stage and should not make or second a motion unless he or she is convinced that no other member of the body will do so the basic format for an agenda item discussion the meeting is governed by the agenda and the agenda constitutes the bodys agreedupon road map for the meeting each agenda item can be handled by the chair in the following basic format first the chair should clearly announce the agenda item number and should clearly state what the subject is the chair should then announce the format that will be followed second following that agenda format the chair should invite the appropriate people to report on the item including any recommendation they might have the appropriate person may be the chair a member of the governing body a staff person or a committee chair charged with providing information about the agenda item third the chair should ask members of the body if they have any technical questions for clarification at this point members of the governing body may ask clarifying questions to the people who reported on the item and they should be given time to respond fourth the chair should invite public comments or if appropriate at a formal meeting open the meeting to public input if numerous members of the public indicate a desire to speak on the subject the chair may limit the time of each public speaker at the conclusion of the public comments the chair should announce that public input has concluded or that the public hearing as the case may be is closed fifth the chair should invite a motion from the governing body members the chair should announce the name of the member who makes the motion sixth the chair should determine if any member of the body wishes to second the motion the chair should announce the name of the member who seconds the motion it is normally good practice for a motion to require a second before proceeding with it to ensure that it is not just one 1 member of the body who is interested in a particular approach however a second is not an absolute requirement and the chair can proceed with consideration and a vote on the motion even when there is no second this is a matter left to the discretion of the chair seventh if the motion is made and seconded the chair should make sure everyone understands the motion this is done in one 1 of three 3 ways the chair can ask the maker of the motion to repeat it   city of peculiar mo ecode360  5639 2 3 h 1 2 a b c 3 d 1 2 3 e f the chair can repeat the motion  or the chair can ask the secretary or the clerk of the body to repeat the motion eighth the chair should now invite discussion of the motion by the members of the governing body if there is no desired discussion or the discussion has ended the vote should proceed immediately and there is no need to repeat the motion if there has been substantial discussion it is normally best to make sure everyone understands the motion by repeating it motions in general motions are the vehicles for decisionmaking it is usually best to have a motion before the governing body prior to discussing an agenda item to help everyone focus on the motion before them motions are made in a simple twostep process first the chair recognizes the member second the member makes a motion by preceding the members desired approach with the words i move    the chair usually initiates the motion by inviting the members to make a motion a motion at this time would be in order suggesting a motion to the members a motion would be in order that    making the motion as noted the chair has every right as a member of the body to make a motion but normally should do so only if he or she wishes a motion to be made but no other member seems willing to do so the three 3 basic motions these three 3 motions are the most common the basic motion the basic motion is the one 1 that puts forward a decision for consideration a basic motion might be i move that we create a fivemember committee to plan and put on our annual fundraiser the motion to amend if a member wants to change a basic motion that is under discussion he or she would move to amend it a motion to amend might be i move that we amend the motion to have a tenmember committee a motion to amend takes the basic motion that is before the body and seeks to change it in some way the substitute motion if a member wants to completely do away with the basic motion under discussion and put a new motion before the governing body he or she would move a substitute motion a substitute motion might be i move a substitute motion that we cancel the annual fundraiser this year motions to amend and substitute motions are often confused but they are quite different and so is their effect if passed a motion to amend seeks to retain the basic motion on the floor but to modify it in some way a substitute motion seeks to throw out the basic motion on the floor and substitute a new and different motion for it the decision as to whether a motion is really a motion to amend or substitute motion is left to the chair so if a member makes what that member calls a motion to amend but the chair determines it is really a substitute motion the chairs designation governs when multiple motions are before the governing body  city of peculiar mo ecode360  6639 1 a b c 2 1 a b c d 2 g up to three 3 motions may be on the floor simultaneously the chair may reject a fourth motion until the three 3 that are on the floor have been resolved when two 2 or three 3 motions are on the floor after motions and seconds at the same time the first vote should be on the last motion made so for example assume the first motion is a basic motion to have a fivemember committee to plan and put on our annual fundraiser during the discussion of this motion a member might make a second motion to amend the main motion to have a 10member committee not a fivemember committee to plan and put on our annual fundraiser and perhaps during that discussion a member makes yet a third motion as a substitute motion that we not have an annual fundraiser this year the proper procedure would be as follows first the chair would deal with the third the last motion on the floor the substitute motion after discussion and debate a vote would be taken first on the third motion if the substitute motion passes it would be a substitute for the basic motion and would eliminate it the first motion would be moot as would the second motion which sought to amend the first motion and the action on the agenda item would be complete no vote would be taken on the first or second motions on the other hand if the substitute motion the third motion failed the chair would proceed to consideration of the second now the last motion on the floor the motion to amend the discussion and debate would focus strictly on the amendment should the committee be five 5 or ten 10 members if the motion to amend passed the chair would now move to consider the main motion the first motion as amended if the motion to amend failed the chair would now move to consider the main motion the first motion in its original format not amended third the chair would now deal with the first motion that was placed on the floor the original motion would either be in its original format fivemember committee or if amended would be in its amended format tenmember committee and the question on the floor for discussion and decision would be whether a committee should plan and put on the annual fundraiser to debate or not to debate the basic rule of motions is that they are subject to discussion and debate accordingly basic motions motions to amend and substitute motions are all eligible each in their turn for full discussion before and by the body the debate can continue as long as members of the body wish to discuss an item subject to the decision of the chairperson chair that it is time to move on and take action there are exceptions to the general rule of free and open debate on motions the exceptions all apply when there is a desire of the body to move on the following motions are not debatable that is when the following motions are made and seconded the chair must immediately call for a vote of the body without debate on the motion a motion to adjourn this motion if passed requires the body to immediately adjourn to its next regularly scheduled meeting this motion requires a simple majority vote a motion to recess this motion if passed requires the body to immediately take a recess normally the chair determines the length of the recess which may range from a few minutes to an hour it requires a simple majority vote a motion to fix the time to adjourn this motion if passed requires the body to adjourn the meeting at the specific time set in the motion for example the motion might be i move we adjourn this meeting at midnight it requires a simple majority vote a motion to table this motion if passed requires discussion of the agenda item to be halted and the agenda item to be placed on hold the motion may contain a specific  city of peculiar mo ecode360  7639 e 1 2 3 4 5 6 h 1 i time in which the item can come back to the body i move we table this item until our regular meeting in october or the motion may contain no specific time for the return of the item in which case a motion to take the item off the table and bring it back to the body will have to be taken at a future meeting a motion to table an item or to bring it back to the body requires a simple majority vote a motion to limit debate the most common form of this motion is to say i move the previous question or i move the question or i call the question when a member of the body makes such a motion the member is really saying ive had enough debate lets get on with the vote when such a motion is made the chair should ask for a second to the motion stop debate and vote on the motion to limit debate the motion to limit debate requires a twothirds 23 vote of the body note that a motion to limit debate could include a time limit for example i move we limit debate on this agenda item to fifteen 15 minutes even in this format the motion to limit debate requires a twothirds 23 vote of the body a similar motion is a motion to object to consideration of an item this motion is not debatable and if passed precludes the body from even considering an item on the agenda it also requires a twothirds 23 vote majority and supermajority votes in a democracy decisions are made with a simple majority vote a tie vote means the motion fails so in a sevenmember body a vote of 43 passes the motion a vote of 33 with one 1 abstention means the motion fails if one 1 member is absent and the vote is 33 the motion still fails almost all motions require a simple majority but there are a few exceptions the exceptions occur when the body is taking an action that effectively cuts off the ability of a minority of the body to take an action or discuss an item these extraordinary motions require a twothirds 23 majority a supermajority to pass motion to limit debate whether a member says i move the previous question i move the question i call for the question or i move to limit debate it all amounts to an attempt to cut off the ability of the minority to discuss an item and it requires a twothirds 23 vote to pass motion to close nominations when choosing officers of the body such as the chair nominations are in order either from a nominating committee or from the floor of the body a motion to close nominations effectively cuts off the right of the minority to nominate officers and it requires a twothirds 23 vote to pass motion to object to the consideration of a question normally such a motion is unnecessary because the objectionable item can be tabled or defeated straight up however when members of a body do not even want an item on the agenda to be considered then such a motion is in order it is not debatable and it requires a twothirds 23 vote to pass motion to suspend the rules this motion is debatable but requires a twothirds 23 vote to pass if the body has its own rules of order conduct or procedure this motion allows the body to suspend the rules for a particular purpose for example the body a private club might have a rule prohibiting the attendance at meetings by nonclub members a motion to suspend the rules would be in order to allow a nonclub member to attend a meeting of the club on a particular date or on a particular agenda item the motion to reconsider there is a special and unique motion that requires a bit of explanation all by itself the motion to reconsider a tenet of parliamentary procedure is finality after vigorous discussion debate and a vote there must be some closure to the issue and so after a vote is taken the matter is deemed closed subject only to reopening if a proper motion to reconsider is made  city of peculiar mo ecode360  8639 a b 2 3 1 2 3 a b c d 4 j a motion to reconsider requires a majority vote to pass but there are two 2 special rules that apply only to the motion to reconsider first is the matter of timing a motion to reconsider must be made at the meeting where the item was first voted upon or at the very next meeting of the body a motion to reconsider made at a later time is untimely the body however can always vote to suspend the rules and by a twothirds 23 majority allow a motion to reconsider to be made at another time second a motion to reconsider may be made only by certain members of the body accordingly a motion to reconsider may be made only by a member who voted in the majority on the original motion if such a member has a change of heart he or she may make the motion to reconsider any other member of the body may second the motion if a member who voted in the minority seeks to make the motion to reconsider it must be ruled out of order the purpose of this rule is finality if a member of the minority could make a motion to reconsider then the item could be brought back to the body again and again which would defeat the purpose of finality if the motion to reconsider passes then the original matter is back before the body and a new original motion is in order the matter may be discussed and debated as if it were on the floor for the first time courtesy and decorum the rules of order are meant to create an atmosphere where the members of the body and the members of the public can attend to business efficiently fairly and with full participation and at the same time it is up to the chair and the members of the body to maintain common courtesy and decorum unless the setting is very informal it is always best for only one 1 person at a time to have the floor and it is always best for every speaker to be first recognized by the chair before proceeding to speak the chair should always ensure that debate and discussion of an agenda item focus on the item and the policy in question not on the personalities of the members of the body debate on policy is healthy  debate on personalities is not the chair has the right to cut off discussion that is too personal too loud or too crude debate and discussion should be focused be free and open in the interest of time the chair may however limit the time allotted to speakers including members of the body can a member of the body interrupt the speaker the general rule is no there are however exceptions a speaker may be interrupted for the following reasons privilege the proper interruption would be point of privilege the chair would then ask the interrupter to state your point appropriate points of privilege relate to anything that would interfere with the normal comfort of the meeting for example the room may be too hot or too cold or a blowing fan might interfere with a persons ability to hear order the proper interruption would be point of order again the chair would ask the interrupter to state your point appropriate points of order relate to anything that would not be considered appropriate conduct of the meeting  for example if the chair moved on to a vote on a motion that permits debate without allowing that discussion or debate appeal if the chair makes a ruling that a member of the body disagrees with that member may appeal the ruling of the chair if the motion is seconded and after debate if it passes by a simple majority vote then the ruling of the chair is deemed reversed call for orders of the day this is simply another way of saying lets return to the agenda if a member believes that the body has drifted from the agreedupon agenda such a call may be made it does not require a vote and when the chair discovers that the  city of peculiar mo ecode360  9639 e a b c 1 2 k  a agenda has not been followed the chair simply reminds the body to return to the agenda item properly before them if the chair fails to do so the chairs determination may be appealed withdraw a motion during debate and discussion of a motion the maker of the motion on the floor at any time may interrupt a speaker to withdraw his or her motion from the floor the motion is immediately deemed withdrawn special notes about public input the rules outlined here help make meetings very publicfriendly but in addition and particularly for the chair it is wise to remember three 3 special rules that apply to each agenda item rule one tell the public what the body will be doing rule two keep the public informed while the body is doing it rule three when the body has acted tell the public what the body did public input is essential to a healthy democracy and community participation in public meetings is an important element of that input the challenge for anyone chairing a public meeting is to accommodate public input in a timely and timesensitive way while maintaining steady progress agenda items the rules presented here for conducting a meeting are offered as tools for effective leadership and as a means of developing sound public policy editors note the ordinance adopting this material had same being included as a part of conflicts of

for financing such facilities from the general public to the development creating the demand the imposition of growth improvement fees will help ensure that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital infrastructure improvements that are necessary to accommodate new development throughout the city the board finds that based upon sound planning and engineering principles it is appropriate for the city to create service areas for the purpose of ensuring that capital infrastructure improvements are planned within a reasonable distance from and benefits are provided to the property from which growth improvement fees are paid and that a reasonable relationship exists between the fee payer and the benefits derived from the improvements that are funded by such fees the

1 a b c 2 d the board has considered the matter of financing new street network improvements the need for which is necessitated by new development which generated new traffic in the city the board hereby finds and declares that a road improvement fee imposed upon new development to finance street network improvements in each service area the need for which is reasonably related to new development furthers the public health safety and welfare of the city therefore the board deems it advisable to adopt road improvement fees the board finds that road improvement fees should be imposed at different rates based on the type of development for the purpose of encouraging new commercial and industrial development in the city the board finds that commercial and industrial development should be charged a lower fee rate per service unit data and calculations supporting the road improvement fees calculation are as follows for purposes of imposing road improvement fees the city shall be divided into two 2 service areas the west service area and the east service area as illustrated on the road improvement fee service area map which is incorporated herein by reference the board finds that average pm peak hour trips is the most accurate and effective method to calculate the demand that new development places on the street network and will therefore be the service unit for calculating road improvement fees based on data and calculations for projected street network improvements to serve new development and the total number of vehicle trips anticipated to be generated by such new development the maximum fee rate that can be charged by the city per trip is approximately one thousand three hundred sixtyfive dollars $136500 in the west service area and approximately one thousand four dollars $100400 in the east service area the board finds that based on plat applications and other recent proposals for residential development the city will experience rapid growth in new residential development and a corresponding increase in traffic volumes generated by such new residential growth the board finds that the rapid population growth will result in a corresponding increase in commercial and industrial development in the city this commercial and industrial growth will generate increased traffic volumes on the citys street network the board further finds that it is appropriate for commercial and industrial development to bear its proportionate share of the cost of new road improvements that are necessary to accommodate the increased traffic that is generated by such development applicability and assessment road improvement fees shall be imposed upon all new development that generates increased traffic on the street network the application at which road improvement fees shall be calculated and charged is an application for a building permit service area the road improvement fee shall be imposed in two 2 service areas as set forth on the road
