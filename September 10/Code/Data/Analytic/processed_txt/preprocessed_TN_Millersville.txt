description a water quality buffer zone is a strip of undisturbed native vegetation either original or reestablished that borders streams and rivers ponds and lakes wetlands and seeps buffers zones are most effective when stormwater runoff is flowing into and buffer zone as shallow sheet flow rather than in concentrated form such as in channels gullies or wet weather conveyances therefore it is critical that the design of any development include management practices to the maximum extent practical that will result in stormwater runoff flowing into and buffer zone as shallow sheet flow buffer zones protect the physical and ecological integrity of water bodies from surrounding upland activities in the following ways  filtering excess amounts of sediment organic material nutrients and other chemicals   providing flood protection   reducing storm runoff velocities   protecting channel bank areas from scour and erosion   providing shade for cooling adjacent water  which allows waters to hold a greater level of dissolved oxygen  and  providing leaf litter and large woody debris important to aquatic organisms app a  i 4202010 intent the intent of this policy is to protect and maintain the native vegetation in riparian areas by implementing specifications for the establishment protection and longterm maintenance of water quality buffers zones along all intermittent and perennial stream waterways and wetlands in or adjacent to new development and significant redevelopment within our jurisdictional authority this policy serves to clarify the requirements for streamside water quality buffers app a  ii 4202010 design standards for water quality buffer zones a water quality buffer zone is required along all perennial and intermittent stream waterways and wetlands as identified on a sevenandonehalfminute usgs quadrangle map or as determined by the tennessee department of environment and conservation or millersvilles public works department the buffer width shall be calculated as follows option #1 a in areas where a floodway profile has been computed as part of an approved flood study the buffer zone shall be the width of the floodway plus at least 50 feet perpendicular from the edge of the floodway on each side of the waterway or 100 feet perpendicular from the top of bank on each side of the waterway whichever is greater b in areas where a floodway profile has not been computed as part of an approved flood study the buffer zone shall be at least 50 feet perpendicular from the top of bank on each side of the waterway c when delineated wetland or critical areas extend beyond the edge of the required buffer zone width the buffer zone shall be adjusted so that the buffer zone consists of the extent of the delineated wetland plus 25 feet extending perpendicular beyond the wetland edge option #2 a in areas where there has been an approved flood study the buffer zone width shall be at least 100 feet perpendicular from the top of bank on each side of the waterway b in areas where there has not been an approved flood study the buffer zone shall be at least 50 feet perpendicular from the top of bank on each side of the waterway c when delineated wetland or critical areas extend beyond the edge of the required buffer zone width the buffer zone shall be adjusted so that the buffer zone consists of the extent of the delineated wetland plus 25 feet extending perpendicular beyond the wetland edge water quality buffer zone width adjustment a if there are 15 percent to 24 percent slopes which are within the required buffer zone width the buffer width must be adjusted to include an additional 20 feet b if there are 25 percent or greater slopes which are within the required buffer zone width the buffer width must be adjusted to include an additional 50 feet c if the adjacent land use involves drainfields from onsite sewage disposal and treatment system ie septic systems subsurface discharges from a wastewater treatment plant or land application of biosolids or animal waste the buffer zone width must be adjusted to include an additional 50 feet d if the land use or activity involves the storage of hazardous substances or petroleum facilities the buffer zone width must be adjusted to include an additional 100 feet e if the land use or activity involves raised septic systems or animal feedlot operations the buffer zone width must be adjusted to include an additional 200 feet f if the land use or activity involves solid waste landfills or junkyards the buffer zone width must be adjusted to include an additional 250 feet app a  iii1 4202010 water quality buffer zone management and maintenance the function of the water quality buffer zone is to protect the physical and ecological integrity of the waterway to reduce flooding potential and to filter runoff from residential and commercial development the buffer zone vegetative target is undisturbed native vegetation a management of the water quality buffer zone includes specific limitations on alteration of the natural conditions the following practices and activities are restricted within the water quality buffer zone except with prior approval by the millersville public works department 1 clearing or grubbing of existing vegetation  2 soil disturbance by grading stripping or other practices  3 filling or dumping  and 4 use storage or application

works department and the following specific design or maintenance features 1 stream crossings paths and utilities a an analysis needs to be conducted to ensure that no economically feasible alternative is available  b the right of way should be the minimum width needed to allow for maintenance access and installation  c the angle of a crossing shall be perpendicular to the stream or buffer in order to minimize clearing requirements  d the minimum number of crossings should be used within each development and no more than one crossing is allowed for every 1000 linear feet of buffer zone where possible the design of roadways and lots within a development should be aligned such that all streams are either to the rear or the side of individual lots never along the front 2 individual trees within the water quality buffer zone may be removed if in danger of falling causing damage to dwellings or other structures or causing blockage of the stream the root wad or stump should be left in place where feasible to maintain soil stability c all site development plans and plats prepared for recording shall 1 show the extent of any water quality buffer zone on the subject property by metes and bounds and be labeled as water quality buffer zone  2 provide a note to reference any water quality buffer zone stating there shall be no clearing grading construction or disturbance of soil andor native vegetation except as permitted by the millersville public works department  and 3 provide a note to reference any protective covenants governing all water quality buffer zones stating any water quality buffer zone shown hereon is subject to protective covenants which may be found in the land records and which restrict disturbance and use of these areas d all water quality buffer zones must be protected during development activities prior to the initiation of development activities ensure adequate visibility of the water quality buffer zones by staking and flagging permanent boundary markers in the form of signage approved by the millersville public works department shall be installed prior to the completion of the development activities e stream banks and other areas within the water quality buffer zone must be left in a stabilized condition upon completion of the development activities the vegetative condition of the entire streamside water quality buffer must be monitored and landscaping or stabilization performed to repair erosion damaged vegetation or other problems identified only native vegetation may be used in conjunction with stabilization activities a guide to selecting native vegetation can be found at wwwtvacomriverlandandshorestabilizationplantsearchhtm  or obtained by contacting the millersville public works department all landscaping or stabilization activities within the water quality buffer zone must have prior approval by the millersville public works department in addition performing work in and around waters of the state may require coverage under a state and possibly a federal permit contact the nearest tennessee department of environment and conservation division of water pollution control environmental assistance center for more information on whether a proposed activity requires a permit f all water quality buffer zones shall be maintained declaration of protective covenant which is required to be submitted for approval by the millersville public works department the covenant shall be recorded in the land records and shall run with the land and continue in perpetuity g all lease agreements must contain a notation regarding the presence and location of protective covenants for water quality buffer zones and which shall contain information on the management and maintenance requirements for the water quality buffer zones for the new resident app a  iii2 4202010 waiversvariances a this water quality buffer zone policy shall apply to all proposed development except for a development which prior to the effective date of this ordinance 1 is covered by a valid unexpired plat in accordance with development regulations  2 is covered by a current executed public works

projects or activities serving a public need where no feasible alternative is available  or 3 the repair and maintenance of public improvements where avoidance and minimization of adverse impacts to wetlands and associated aquatic ecosystems have been addressed c waivers for development may also be granted in two additional forms if deemed appropriate by the millersville public works department 1 the water quality buffer zone width may be relaxed and permitted to become narrower at some points as long as the width is not reduced to less than 35 feet perpendicular from the top of bank and the overall average width of the buffer meets the minimum requirement 2 the planning department may offer credit for additional density elsewhere on the site in compensation for the loss of developable land due to the requirements of this ordinance this compensation may increase the total number of dwelling units on the site up to the amount permitted under the base zoning d the applicant shall submit a written request for a variance to the millersville public works department the application shall include specific reasons justifying the variance and any other information necessary to evaluate the proposed variance request the millersville public works department may require an alternatives analysis that clearly demonstrates that no other feasible alternatives exist and that minimal impact will occur as a result of the project or development e when considering a request for a variance the millersville public works department may require additional information such as but not limited too site design landscape planting fencing the placement of signs and the establishment of water quality best management practices in order to reduce adverse impacts on water quality streams and wetlands app a  iv 4202010 conflict with other regulations where the standards and management requirements of this buffer ordinance are in conflict with other laws regulations and policies regarding streams steep slopes erodible soils wetlands floodplains timber harvesting land disturbance activities or other environmental protective measures the more restrictive requirements shall apply app a  v 4202010 appendix b  city of millersville dry detention basin policy description a detention basin also known as a detention pond is the most common method to satisfy stormwater detention requirements it is applicable to small and large developments can be easily designed and constructed and is longlasting and durable while reducing peak flows with adequate inspection and maintenance this practice can also provide a reduction in sediment as well as a reduction in nutrients toxic materials heavy metals floatable materials oxygen demanding substances and oil and grease a dry detention basin is intended to drain dry between storm events but sometimes may not have a chance to drain completely between closely occurring storm events the detention basin begins to fill as stormwater runoff enters the facility the first flush volume is captured in order to improve water quality one or more outlet structures then release the stormwater runoff slowly to reduce peak discharge rates and to provide time for sediments to settle litter and debris are prevented from leaving the detention basin and soluble pollutants are captured by a combination of vegetation and soils app b  i 4202010 selection criteria a the primary objective is to reduce the incoming peak flow discharge and slow the stormwater runoff response from a particular property or development thus reducing flooding downstream b the secondary objective is to remove suspended sediments trash and debris oil grease and other pollutants to protect the water quality of tennessee streams and channels although dry detention basins are usually not as effective at removing soluble pollutants as wet detention basins and wetlands dry detention basins are usually easier and less expensive to construct inspect and maintain dry detention basins can be used wherever a lack of sufficient supply water would prevent the use of wet detention basins or wetlands c dry detention basins can also supply multiple benefits for passive recreation during dry periods recreational trails ball fields picnicking portions of a dry detention basin that are not wetted frequently can be attractively landscaped or used for other purposes app b  ii 4202010 design and sizing considerations a a permanent detention basin design must be stamped by a professional engineer licensed in the state of tennessee the professional engineer must be qualified by education and experience to perform the necessary hydrologic and hydraulic calculations b as the primary objective dry detention basins must be designed to have adequate detention storage and outlet structures to limit the peak discharge rate for the post development conditions to be no greater than the peak discharge rate for the predevelopment conditions multistage detention is required for the oneyear twoyear fiveyear tenyear and 25year storms with nrcs type ii 24hour rainfall distribution additional stages ie 50year and 100year may be required for special watersheds c as the secondary objective water quality improvement is obtained use of the first flush treatment volume the first onehalf inches of stormwater runoff over the entire contributing drainage area of the development is defined as the first flush volume with a minimum value of 4500 cubic feet the initial wave of stormwater runoff is more likely to contain aeriallydeposited sediments particulates from vehicles such as incomplete combustion dust from brake linings tire particles leaves trash cigarette butts etc the first flush volume must be captured and then slowly released over a minimum 24hour period and maximum of 72 hours d additional measures may be required to improve stormwater quality depending upon the nature of the land use and expected pollutants pretreatment of stormwater runoff with a media filtration inlet or oilwater separator may be necessary a trash rack for capturing floating debris is generally considered to be standard equipment for a stormwater treatment bmp app b  iii 4202010 location and layout basic elements of a dry detention basin are illustrated in figure 1 the recommended design includes the use of a sediment forebay to reduce sediment loading particularly if the postconstruction detention basin is a modification from a temporary sediment basin during the construction phase the use of an upper stage for storage of infrequent storms is optional  there are both benefits and drawbacks a shallow detention basin with a large surface area will usually perform better than a deeper detention basin with the same volume however shallow storage areas increase the overall surface area needed for detention design flow paths to minimize potential shortcircuiting by locating the drainage inlets to the basin as far away from the outlet structure as possible the lengthtowidth ratio of a basin should be at least  baffles or backslope drains may be used to prevent shortcircuiting for ratios less than  increase pond area and volume to compensate for dead spaces if topography or aesthetics require the pond to have an irregular shape it is important to reduce the velocity of incoming stormwater using riprap or other energy dissipaters although dry detention basins are generally less expensive to construct and maintain than wet detention basins they provide lower water quality benefits the primary disadvantage of a dry detention basin is the amount of surface area required which can be reduced somewhat by using concrete retaining walls on one or more sides in general concrete retaining walls should not face southward in order to reduce the potential for heating on hot summer days bedrock and topography must be considered during preliminary design karst topography may indicate fractured bedrock dissolved limestone passages or sinkholes for which a detention basin would be highly detrimental the additional water volume that is introduced to the underground limestone passages or even the additional weight of ponded water could intensify karst activity and eventually collapse the bed of the detention pond interaction with site utilities must be considered during preliminary design typical utilities include electrical telephone cable tv water sewer natural gas petroleum etc these utilities may or may not be in a dedicated utility easement so it is always necessary to conduct a careful site survey detention basins including embankments should not be allowed over utility lines conversely utility trenches should not be constructed on existing detention basin structures detention basin easements and access must be considered during preliminary design in order to allow for the construction easement and maintenance detention basins that are not frequently inspected and maintained often become more of a nuisance than a beneficial part of a stormwater management program in particular provide access for inspection and maintenance to the sediment forebay and to the outlet control structure it may also be desirable to encourage or discourage public access to the detention basin by using site grading signs fences or gates additional safety elements include trash racks grating over pipes and culverts gentle side slopes whenever possible increased visibility andor lighting in residential areas etc small detention basins serving individual properties do not offer as much recreational benefits as community or regional detention basins would regional facilities can often be landscaped to offer recreational and aesthetic benefits jogging and walking trails picnic areas and ball fields are some of the typical uses for example portions of the facility for flood control of major design storms can be used for exercise areas soccer fields or football fields wildlife benefits can also be provided in the form of islands buffer areas or preservation zones it is important to maintain such areas however as their primary purpose is for stormwater management under no circumstances should debris be allowed to accumulate near the outlet app b  iv 4202010 editors note figure 1 can be found in city offices on request volume and size the volume of a dry detention basin consists of two elements the live pool the upper portion of the basin representing detention capability and the first flush volume the lower portion of the basin representing stormwater quality treatment since the postdevelopment peak runoff may not exceed the predevelopment peak flow rate the upper sections volume should be based on a standard storage routing method detention basins shall be sized to collect the onehalf inches of stormwater runoff from the entire contributing area or the first 4500 cubic feet of stormwater runoff whichever is greater the first flush volume must be released at a controlled rate over a minimum 24hour period and a maximum 72hours period as a warning to those who design detention basins it should be realized that future stormwater regulations are likely to be more stringent than the current regulations this is mostly driven by national and state laws and regulations which will require municipalities and county governments to accomplish additional pollution reduction with a proportional effort for water quality monitoring and enforcement app b  v 4202010 grading side slopes of detention basins and embankment dams shall be  hv or flatter except where approved by the engineering reviewing authority this encourages a strong growth of vegetation on the side slopes helps to prevent soil erosion and allows for safer mowing steep slopes particularly on embankments or other fill soils will contribute to soil erosion if not properly vegetated or stabilized and thereby reduce or negate the effectiveness of a dry detention basin with respect to water quality vegetate the side slopes and basin bottom to the maximum extent practical if significant side erosion is expected consider the use of soil stabilization or armoring techniques detention basins should not be located immediately above or below a steep slope or grade because impounded water may create slope stability problems minimum width for top of embankment is six feet the embankment height should allow for up to ten percent settlement of embankment unless the embankment is thoroughly compacted with vibratory equipment or sheepsfoot rollers the top of embankment after expected settlement shall generally be at least two feet above the top of outlet structure and at least one foot above the peak 100year water surface elevation compaction in the immediate area of the emergency spillway can be difficult but is necessary the use of a backslope drain can be very beneficial in preventing erosion at detention basins see figure 5 for a typical detail the backslope drain is also useful for increasing lengths of flow paths to prevent short circuiting of the detention basin intercepted stormwater can be routed around the detention basin to enter at the most hydraulically distant point from the outlet structure app b  vi 4202010 editors note figure 5 can be found in city offices on request outlet structure detention basin outlet structures should be constructed of durable materials such as concrete or masonry block corrugated metal pipe cmp and plastic hdpe risers and drain pipes are popular in engineering design but are susceptible to crushing corrosion and flotation in detention basins a concrete outlet structure is generally preferable to a masonry block structure because it is sturdier and more durable provisions should be made for sufficient reinforcement and anchoring of the riser and drain pipe system the specific flowcontrolling elements of an outlet structure may include one or more of the following a circular orifice a noncircular orifice a rectangular weir a trapezoidal weir a triangular weir a vnotch weir culvert entrance control or a riser overflow opening figures 2 and 3 illustrate possible designs for the outlet structure these details are only two possible ways to accomplish stormwater detention and stormwater quality control the first flush volume is typically drained during a minimum time of 24 hours by using an orifice with a designed size maximum drain time should be less than 72 hours to allow for sufficient volume recovery prior to the next period of rainfall the first flush volume can be filtered by using an underdrain system shown in figure 2 or by an aboveground filter box with sand or aggregate shown in figure 3 figure 4 shows an alternative outlet structure with a water quality manhole provide an emergency spillway in order to route large storms facility without overtopping app b  vii 4202010 editors note figures 24 can be found in city offices on request emergency spillway an emergency spillway should be included in addition to the primary outlet structure on a detention pond the purpose of this spillway is to pass storm events that exceed the design capacity of the pond in order to prevent overtopping the embankment the emergency spillway should be located over an undisturbed abutment area and not over the embankment fill for stability reasons except where approved by an engineering reviewing authority the emergency spillway capacity should be designed to prevent overtopping the embankment structure or dam during a storm event commensurate with the impoundment volume dam size and downstream flood hazard potential in event of dam failure the minimum spillway capacity should be capable of handling a 100year storm event where feasible the emergency spillway should be made independent from the riser control structure to avoid the possibility of overtopping from riser or drain pipe clogging from vandalism or trash the designer is referred to the requirements set forth in the tennessee safe dams act and regulations at wwwstatetnusenvironmentpermitssafedamhtm  app b  viii 4202010 other design elements a sediment forebayto facilitate the cleanout of sediment trash debris leaves etc the sediment forebay typically contains five percent to ten percent of the total volume it should be located at a point where velocities have dissipated to allow large sediments and debris to settle out a forebay can be separated from the remainder of a detention basin by several means a lateral sill with rooted wetland vegetation rockfilled gabion rock retaining wall or rock check dam placed laterally across the basin the sediment forebay should be easily accessible so that it can be inspected and maintained b public safety should be considered particularly in residential areas operating detention basins often attract neighborhood children avoid steep slopes and dropoffs  consider routes for escaping the detention basin if a person accidentally falls in avoid depths over four feet when possible  provide fencing and signs in areas where children may potentially play and where steep slopes are used in the detention area c a lowflow channel or concrete trickle ditch can assist in completely draining detention basins with flat slopes it also assists with the observation and removal of accumulated sediment a typical design would be a triangular ditch four feet wide and three inches deep with a slope of onehalf to one percent d antiseep collars or a cutoff layer of compacted clay are required around the outlet pipe to prevent internal piping and erosion an antiseep collar should extend at least one pipe diameter from the culvert in all directions with compacted clay backfill using small mechanical tampers the designer is referred to the tennessee erosion & sediment control handbook for antiseep collar considerations e to prevent the outlet riser from clogging include trash racks or other debris barriers with a maximum opening size of six inches on all outlet structures except for any emergency spillway structures that are designed for a 25year storm or greater return period trash racks that are placed at an angle to the direction of flow tend to force debris up and away from the outlet opening and are somewhat less vulnerable to clogging these racks should be regularly cleaned and maintained f provide a permanent means for vehicle access to the detention basin detention basins must be located in a maintenance easement so that authorities have the right to inspect the facility this easement should be free of large trees and excessive vehicle grades g a skimmer oilwater separator or other type of stormwater runoff pretreatment is recommended for drainage areas having greater than 50 percent impervious surface or where there may be a potential source of oil and grease contamination in addition to most large parking lots oil and grease contamination is also likely for vehicle fueling and maintenance facilities h an antivortex device for the outlet structure may be needed for very large detention basins in areas where public access is not controlled the antivortex device may be a combination of vanes above the outlet structure or guide walls around the outlet structure that increases the inlet flow efficiency and might lessen the chance of humans drowning or reduce the potential for erosion and structural undercutting the designer is referred to the tennessee erosion and sediment control handbook for antivortex and trash rack considerations app b  ix 4202010 constructioninspection considerations inadequate storage is the most frequent problem that occurs in the design review before construction and also for the asbuilt review after construction this can occur for several reasons 1 the design engineer may not allow enough room to construct the detention basin most often due to insufficient design detail such as slope transitions setbacks property lines drainage easements parking lot widths inaccurate contours or incorrectomitted utilities locations 2 the engineer who performs the stormwater computations may not be the same person who does the site layout and grading details the required detention storage volume and outlet structure details need to be communicated clearly to the design engineer for inclusion on the plans and for construction layout 3 the construction contractor may not correctly follow the design plans and consequently does not excavate deep enough or build berms of sufficient height to hold the required detention volume this may occur due to rock formations encountered or to groundwater it is important that the elevationvolume configuration shown on the plans be preserved during construction so that the detention basin functions according to intended design 4 the construction contractor changes the basin configuration during the construction without being aware of the required volume approval from the engineer was not obtained for a design change it is highly recommended that the design engineer be involved in the construction and inspection phases of the detention basin special attention should be given to the requirements for detention basin volume elevations and sizes of each outlet embankment crest and emergency spillway crest elevations  embankment compaction side slopes size and shape of various weirs or orifices outlet structure anchoring trash racks and installation of antiseepage collars proper hydraulic design of the outlet is critical to achieving good performance for both stormwater detention and stormwater quality of the dry detention basin the two most common problems for detention basin outlets are a the discharge capacity of the outlet system is too great at the detention design depth this causes excessive basin outflows and results in fast drawdown times and inadequate filling of the detention basin volume both stormwater outflow and stormwater quality will suffer b the outlet structure clogs because it is not adequately protected against trash and debris the use of innovative trash racks is recommended effective trash racks are often created using welded rebar with 6inch openings sloped trash racks are preferable to vertical ones for forcing floating debris upward and away from the opening rather than being forced against the trash rack and causing clogging this is sufficient to stop most beverage cans fast food containers tree limbs etc properly designed and installed trash racks also provide a measure of safety to children who may otherwise be pulled toward and held against the opening app b  x 4202010 inspection and maintenance effective and safe operation of a detention basin depends on continuous maintenance of all system components detention basin easements and access must be considered during the planning stage in order to allow for proper inspection and maintenance 1 inspect the dry detention basin regularly eg at least monthly and particularly after heavy rainfall events record all observations and problems perform any maintenance and repair erosion promptly remove debris and trash after storm events check all outlet structures regularly for clogging 2 detention basins should be surveyed approximately every five years to check for adequate embankment settlement and freeboard and for storage volume as per intended engineering design calculations and plans 3 remove sediment when accumulation becomes noticeable one inch to two inches over a wide area or if resuspension is observed or probable sediment may be permitted to accumulate if the detention basin volume has been overdesigned with adequate controls to prevent further sediment movement if a sand underdrain is used look for reduced first flush infiltration or ponded water  sand layer replacement or maintenance may be needed 4 maintain a thick and healthy stand of vegetation usually grass mow or trim at regular intervals to encourage thick growth remove leaves grass clippings or sticks from detention basin regularly to prevent stormwater pollution remove trees or nuisance vegetation as necessary to ensure structural integrity of embankments signs should be posted at detention ponds to discourage local homeowners from depositing yard trimmings waste and fill materials inside the basin appropriate signs and barriers such as fences should also be considered at detention basins where children have easy access to the site app b  xi 4202010 sediment removal a primary function of stormwater treatment bmps is to collect and remove sediment which is a pollutant itself and is associated with several other attached pollutants the sediment accumulation rate is dependent on a number of factors including watershed size facility sizing construction upstream and nearby industrial or commercial activities etc sediments should be identified before sediment removal and disposal is performed special attention or sampling should be given to sediments accumulated from industrial or manufacturing facilities heavy commercial sites fueling centers or automotive maintenance areas parking areas or other areas where pollutants are suspected sediment should be treated as potentially hazardous until proven otherwise some sediment may contain contaminants for which tdec requires special disposal procedures consult tdecdivision of water pollution control if there is any uncertainty about what the sediment contains or if it is known to contain contaminants clean sediment may be used as fill

commercial and industrial areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare 2 to carry out such purposes nonconforming uses which adversely affect the development of such areas must be subject to certain limitations the provisions governing nonconforming uses set forth in this chapter are therefore

the needs of the area of the citys expected economic expansion for all types of distributive industrial and related activities with due allowance for the need for choice of suitable sites 2 to protect distributive industrial and related activities as well as residential and related activities by providing for the separation of these uses and as far as possible provide that appropriate space needs for distributive and industrial activities are available by prohibiting the use of such space for residential purposes 3 to encourage industrial development which is free from danger of fire explosions toxic or noxious matter radiation smoke dust or other particulate matter and other hazards and from offensive noise vibration odorous matter heat humidity glare and other objectionable influences by permitting such development areas where this chapter restricts the emission of such nuisances without regard to the industrial products and processes involved 4 to protect adjacent residential and commercial areas and to protect the labor force in other establishments engaged in less offensive types of industrial and related activities by restricting those industrial activities which involve danger of fire explosions toxic or noxious matter radiation smoke dust or other particulate matter and other hazards or create offensive noise vibration heat humidity glare and other objectionable influences by permitting such development in areas where this chapter restricts the emission of such nuisances without regard to the industrial products or processes involved 5 to protect industrial activities and related developments against congestion as far as is possible and appropriate in each area by limiting the bulk of buildings in relation to the land around them and to one another and by requiring space off public ways for parking and loading facilities associated with such activities 6 to promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building
