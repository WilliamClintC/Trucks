finding and purpose a  north little rock ar ordinances 214543 the city council hereby finds there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision normally provided by certain parents and guidance for juveniles under 18 years of age resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior including vandalism noisy and rowdy behavior breaking and entering public drinking and littering harassment of residents and more serious violent crimes including battery and murder b the city council further finds that the offensive activities of juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances because the activities are concealed whenever police officers are present and that the establishment of reasonable curfew regulations will enable the community to better control the free and unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles c the city council further finds and has determined that a curfew meets a very real local need and that curfew ordinances in other communities have been a factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency a curfew in this city is particularly appropriate in view of the basic residential nature of the community and the sense of the community that there is a proper time for the cessation of outdoor activities of juveniles this attitude of the community is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this division which takes into consideration the danger hours for nocturnal crime d north little rock is basically a family community parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm by a substantial majority of the community legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many communities over the years the city council has determined that as parental control increases there is a likelihood that juvenile delinquency decreases and that there is a need for nocturnal curfew for juveniles in the city and that the establishment of a curfew applicable to juveniles will reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of parents and guardians over juveniles in their care and custody  curfew hours established it shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age under 18 to be or
