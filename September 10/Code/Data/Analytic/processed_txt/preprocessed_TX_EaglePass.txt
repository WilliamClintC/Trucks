subdivisions the developer of any subdivision classified as a major subdivision may be required to dedicate parkland during the preliminary plat approval process the developer shall designate a location for the proposed park see parkland dedication requirements to meet the intent of the chapter one larger park rather than several small ones spread over the subdivision may be required at this time the planning and zoning commission will decide whether or not the proposed property dedication would be consistent with the desires of the city in terms of quality and location of its parklands should the director of parks and recreation decide that the parkland is not desirable and then the developer shall pay cash contribution in lieu of parkland dedication calculated pursuant to subsection 5c b properties not required to dedicate park land 1 all residential properties that are classified as minor subdivisions 2 the dedication of land or cash contributions shall not apply to
