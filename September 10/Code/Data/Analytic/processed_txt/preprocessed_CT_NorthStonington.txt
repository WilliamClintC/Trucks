stonington connecticut copyrighted material municipal the north stonington connecticut 2005 history of north stonington north stonington which had been named in 1724 while still a part of the town of stonington had been incorporated as a separate town in 180 and had become the town of north stonington a great many people seem not to know the many reasons why the town of north stonington became incorporated some seem to think that the population increase had something to do with it there are others who think that distance to travel to their house of worship had something to do with it then there are others who seem to believe that the difficulty of attending town meetings had a great deal to do with it due to the great distance to be traveled to attend these meetings the foremost and primary reason was none other than taxation taxes which were considered unjust due to the fact that these taxes were levied against north stonington for improvements made for the town of stonington to understand the reason why taxation was the issue i would like to refer you to the history of the town of stonington as written by thomas wheeler pertaining to its ecclesiastical history to quote the first church organized in the town of stonington was formed  the 2nd congregational church of stonington was organized in 1727 the controversy over the boundary line dividing the town of stonington into two religious societies and the location of their first meetinghouse served to divide the people as to the choice of a pastor for the church after calling mr william worthington mr thomas croghead and mr jabez wright they finally agreed upon mr ebenezer russell as and for their gospel preaching minister who was ordained  at which time the church was organized reverend russell continued pastor of the church until his death which took place  the church and society then invited mr joseph fisk who was ordained  and for a few years mr fisks pastorate was eminently successful the new light awakening as it was generally called by the people served to divide the church which resulted in the organization of strict congregational or separatist church  these two congregational churches maintained separate religious worship until  when they were reunited under the ministrations of reverend joseph ayer 18271846 the next church in the town of stonington was the baptist church organized at punghungwe nuck hill in 174 and was the outcome of the great awakening socalled which commenced under the preaching of drs edwards and whitfield the next church of stonington was the baptist church organized 1775 at long point now stonington boro where most members resided no more churches were organized in stonington before the division of the town in 180 pending the agitation and controversial feeling between the inhabitants of the northern and southern sections of the town of stonington relative to the old mail stage route and the layout of the new highway from stonington boro to old mystic and the construction of the bridge over lamberts cove pine tree point to quana duct in order to give the electors of the town an opportunity to decide the matter in question a town meeting was legally warned and held at the old meetinghouse at the road  for the express purpose of dividing the town of stonington so as to relieve the tax payers of the northern section of the town from the cost of the new highway and bridge the meeting was largely attended and after an animated and heated discussion of the matter in question it was voted by a small majority thereof to divide said town into two separate townships by the old society line and that the north part shall be called jefferson when the general assembly met the may following the division of the town was duly considered and adopted and divided on the line suggested but the name of jefferson for the new town was not adopted for the reason that the society of north stonington had been so named by the general assembly and had had charge of schools therein for a great many years and the name had become identified with its vital interests so it was considered not best to change it and the new town was called north

land is now part of the economic development district no other portion of the hc zoning district is included in the sewer district 3 the contiguous land area owned by the state of connecticut as of the effective date of these regulations 9252000 and located immediately south of connecticut route 617 and west of connecticut route 49 as of october 201 said land is now part of the economic development district the establishment of the sewer district is not intended and shall not be deemed to create any private or public rights to connect to the municipal sewerage system the fact that a lot or parcel of land is located within the sewer district shall not in and of itself be a sufficient basis for the authority to allow a connection to the municipal sewerage system rather the authority shall permit such connection only for the following lots or parcels within the sewer district subject however to the provisions of subsection c of this section 1 properties that have been identified by the authority as having subsurface sewage disposal systems that as of the effective date of these regulations had already failed and that are incapable of being repaired or replaced onsite due to physical limitations and public health code requirements  2 properties that are zoned for industrial or other businessrelated nonresidential development and that are served by a metered watersupply system  3 properties allowed to be connected to the municipal sewerage system in accordance with subsection b of this section it is specifically the intention of the authority and the purpose of these regulations to exclude from connection to the municipal sewerage system any properties not included in the categories set forth above or described in subsection b of this section regardless of whether such excluded properties are within the sewer district or are proximate to the sewer line such exclusion is deemed by the authority to be necessary to further the policy of sewer avoidance and to reserve the available capacity of the municipal sewerage system as it may be provided under any intermunicipal agreement or agreements between the town of stonington and the town of north stonington for properties to be developed for industrial or other businessrelated nonresidential uses b connection of other properties to the municipal sewerage system as set forth in subsection a of this section it is the intention of the authority that no properties other than those specifically identified in subsection a of this section be connected to the municipal sewerage system regardless of whether such other properties may be near abut or contain any portion of the municipal sewerage system nonetheless the authority may allow the connection of other properties to the municipal sewerage system if and only if all of the following criteria have been met 1 the connection of such property to the municipal sewerage system must be necessary to remedy the failure of a subsurface sewage disposal system  2 the authority must be provided with written certifications by a professional engineer properly licensed within the state of connecticut and by the ledge light health district or a town consultant having equivalent qualifications that it is not feasible to repair or replace the failed septic system onsite and that all administrative remedies under the connecticut public health including the possibility of waivers or variances have been exhausted  3 the failed septic system must either have been a in existence on the date of adoption of these regulations  or b constructed after the date of adoption of these regulations in accordance with all then existing local state and federal landuse health and environmental laws including but not limited to statutes ordinances regulations and codes subject to the additional provisions set forth below 4 the property to be connected must either a abut a portion of the municipal sewerage system already in existence  or b abut another lot that is already served by or that abuts any portion of the municipal sewerage system already in existence provided the authority may refuse to allow the connection of any property to the municipal sewerage system if the remediation of the septicsystem failure on such property would require the extension of the municipal sewer line by more than 200 feet not including the length of any private sewer lateral line necessary to connect the failed septic system to the municipal sewerage system  and 5 the authority must find that there is sufficient excess capacity available in the municipal sewerage system to accommodate the additional wastewater flows under any intermunicipal agreement or agreements the town of north stonington may have with the town of stonington a septic system constructed after the date of adoption of regulations shall not be deemed to have been constructed in accordance with the provisions of subsection 3 above unless the applicable laws would have allowed the construction of the septic system regardless of the existence or planned extension of the municipal sewerage system c power of authority to refuse connection notwithstanding the provisions of subsections a and b of this section the authority reserves the power and right to refuse to allow any property whether within or outside of the sewer district to connect to the municipal sewerage system such refusal may be made if in the judgment of the authority the proposed connection would result in wastewater flows of a volume or character that would or could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on any portion of the municipal sewerage system including that portion located within the town of stonington for purposes of this section the term adverse effect includes but is not limited to overloading or chemical or physical damage to any portion of the municipal sewerage system the authority may also refuse to allow the connection of any property to the municipal sewerage system if in the judgment of the authority the projected flow volumes would use up a substantial portion of the excess capacity available to the town of north stonington under any intermunicipal agreement or agreements with the town of stonington and the authority determines that the preservation of such excess capacity is necessary or desirable to accomplish other development objectives of the town of north stonington in determining whether to refuse any request for connection to the municipal sewerage system the authority may also consider any potential impact of the use for which the connection has been proposed on groundwater quality and quantity groundwater recharge and existing and potential water supplies or watersupply sources d orders to connect in accordance with gs  7257 the authority may order the owner of any building to which the municipal sewerage system is available to connect the building to the system no such order shall be issued until after a public hearing with respect thereto after due notice in writing to such property owner any owner aggrieved by such an order may appeal in accordance with the provisions of the general statutes if any owner fails to comply with an order to connect the authority shall cause the connection to be made and shall assess the expense thereof against such owner it is the intention of the authority that all properties within the sewer district having septic systems that have failed and that cannot be replaced or repaired on site be connected to the municipal sewerage system as soon as practicable after such connection becomes possible e no increase in flows the authority recognizes that the capacity of the municipal sewerage system to receive sanitary sewage discharges from properties located within the town of north stonington may be limited by among other things intermunicipal agreements between the town of north stonington and the town of stonington therefore it is the intention of the authority that the average daily wastewater flows measured on a monthly basis from properties connected to the municipal sewerage system may not be significantly increased beyond permitted flows as defined below without the express written approval of the authority the permitted flow for any use shall be an average daily wastewater flow measured on a monthly basis that the authority determines to be reasonably necessity for the conduct of an existing or proposed use in making a determination as to the amount of any permitted flow the authority may consider any relevant information including but not limited to available records of actual wastewater flows for existing uses any increase of more than five percent of 500 gallons per day whichever is less in a permitted flow shall be considered significant and shall not be allowed without the express written approval of the authority in order to facilitate the authoritys review of compliance with the provisions of these regulations the owners or lessees of all nonresidential properties that are connected to the municipal sewerage system and that have projected or actual wastewater flows of 5000 gallons per day or more shall be required to provide the authority with written daily records of the amounts of water usage on their respective properties compilations of such records shall be submitted to the authority no less than once every three months f requirement of reporting landuse changes in order that the authority may properly monitor wastewater flows from properties connected to the municipal sewerage system it is necessary that information regarding any significant changes to the uses of those properties be reported to the authority therefore any owner of property connected to the municipal sewerage system shall prior to the construction of any additional buildings or structures on the property or any alteration of an existing building or structure that would increase its bulk volume file with the authority 1 a written notice of intent to undertake such construction or alteration together with sufficient plans to enable the authority to understand and review the nature and potential effects of such construction or alteration on water usage  and 2 a written statement of the extent to which such construction or alteration and the uses to which such new or altered buildings or structures may be put may be reasonably expected to increase the average daily wastewater flows from the property the authority may refuse to allow the additional wastewater flow if it determines that the flow would either 1 exceed the capacity of the municipal sewerage system as permitted under any intermunicipal agreement or agreements  or 2 adversely affect any part or any process of the municipal sewerage system in the town of north stonington or the town of stonington g penalties for noncompliance if the authority finds that any connection has been made to the municipal sewerage system or that any flows to the municipal sewerage system have been increased in violation of any provision of these regulations the authority may order the disconnection of the noncomplying property from the municipal sewerage system or may issue such other orders or take such other actions as may be allowed by law to bring such properties into compliance with these regulations except as provided hereafter no such order shall be issued until after a public hearing with respect thereto after due notice in writing to such property owner the authority may issue such an order without first holding a hearing if it deems the immediate issuance of such order to be necessary to prevent imminent and substantial harm to any portion of the municipal sewerage system whether located in the town of north stonington or the town of stonington  however the authority shall in such circumstances provide an opportunity for a hearing as soon as practicable after issuing such order and shall provide due notice of the hearing in writing to the property owner nothing in this be deemed to prevent the authority from taking immediate action to

with all applicable provisions of state and federal law in particular many of the procedural requirements set forth in these regulations are based solely on state requirements that were in effect at the time of adoption in the event that state or federal law is later modified or is determined by a court to be inconsistent with any provisions of these regulations it is the intention of the commission that the relevant provisions shall be deemed superseded by the applicable requirements of state or federal law and that those requirements shall be applied as though they were expressly incorporated herein interpretation 21 201 general provisions regarding the application of these regulations 2011 prohibited if not permitted any use of land buildings or structures not expressly

other structure may comply with these regulations does not mean that it complies with all other applicable laws regulations or other legal restrictions or requirements therefore the issuance of any permit or approval by the commission or its authorized agents does not necessarily mean that a landowner has obtained all necessary permits or approvals for the use or that the use may be lawfully established without such other permits or approvals by way of example only the commission might issue a permit for a use that is nonetheless not allowable due to private land restrictions or because state or federal law may restrict such use the commission has no legal authority to determine whether legal restrictions other than those established by these regulations or by the north stonington subdivision regulations apply to any particular parcel of land likewise the commission has no responsibility to alert an applicant or landowner about the possible application of any other laws
