increased runoff created by the changed properties of the ground surface and the rate of discharge of this increased runoff these are both of great relevance to storm water management the natural condition of the land before development is in relative balance with the natural capacity of the receiving creeks normally the undeveloped conditions provide greater permeability and longer times of concentration by modification of the ground surface from the irregular pervious and vegetationcovered the areas are changed to more impervious more quickly drained and in some cases denuded of vegetation it is the policy of the city to protect and promote the public health safety and general welfare the management of storm water will reduce the erosion on land and creek channels will reduce

applicable federal and state law is authorized to grant one 1 or more nonexclusive franchises to construct operate maintain and reconstruct cable systems within the city b the city council finds that cable service has become an integral part of its citizens lives and that evolving cable systems have the potential to play an even more dramatic role in the future providing great benefits and advanced capabilities to residents of the city at the same time the rapidly emerging role of the cable modem as an integrated broadband communications platform coupled with the relative lack of competition faced by the incumbent cable operator within the city limits necessitates a finding that the local government has a legitimate and vital role to play in regulating cable services in a manner that ensures high quality customer service while at the same time fostering competition to the extent permitted by law the council further finds that the public convenience safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers that are vested in the city or such persons as the city designates c in order to ensure that the city and its residents receive state of

deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof d the council further finds that ongoing industry consolidation has resulted in less local accountability and that therefore flexible

for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of c below are met c a user who desires to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and 3 the user has submitted the following information to the director of public works within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five 5 days a a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  b the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and c steps being taken andor planned

lost or fails a for the purposes of this the word bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 the words severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c and d of this bypass notifications 1 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the director of public works at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible 2

the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce

bypass 1 bypass is prohibited and the director of public works may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  charles city code reserved b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under c of this the director of public works may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the director of public works determines that it will meet the three 3 conditions listed in d1 of this general provisions article xiv fats
