engaged in for profit compensatory storage the nfip floodway standard in 44 cfr 603 d restricts new development from obstructing the flow of water and increasing flood heights however this provision does not address the need to maintain flood storage especially in flat areas the floodplain provides a valuable function by storing floodwaters when fill or buildings are placed in the flood fringe the flood storage areas are lost and flood heights will go up because there is less room for the floodwaters this is particularly important in smaller watersheds which respond sooner to changes in the topography one approach that may be used to address this issue is to require compensatory storage to offset any loss of flood storage capacity some communities adopt more restrictive standards that regulate the amount of fill or buildings that can displace floodwater in the flood fringe community rating system credits are available for communities that adopt compensatory storage requirements

citystatezip phone erosion control is important on any building site regardless of its size usually principles and methods for controlling erosion and reducing offsite sedimentation are relatively simple and inexpensive here are four basic steps to follow when developing a building site also see erosion control for homebuilders village of bourbonnais building department 1 evaluate the site inventory and evaluate the resources on the lot before building location of structures should be based on the lots natural features identify trees that you want to save and vegetation that will remain during construction also identify areas where you want to limit construction traffic wherever possible preserve existing vegetation to help control erosion and offsite sedimentation 2 select & install initial erosionsediment control practices determine the specific practices needed and install them before clearing the site among the more commonly used practices are vegetative filter strips silt fences gravel drives and inlet protection 3 develop a practice maintenance program maintenance of all practices is essential for them to function properly practices should be inspected twice a week and after each rainfall event when a problem is identified repair or replace the practice immediately if frequent repairs are required another more substantial practice may need to be selected in addition any sediment that is tracked onto the street should be scraped and deposited in a protected area do not flush sediment from the street with water 4 revegetate the site establish vegetation as soon as possible soils compacted by grading need to be broken up or tilled prior to vegetating or placing sod a well maintained lot has a higher sale potential i understand that i am responsible for implementing soil erosion and sediment control measures as necessary to control offsite sedimentation it is understood that submitting this notice of intent for soil erosion and sediment control allows the village of bourbonnais building department representative the right to conduct onsite observations of the site throughout the active construction phase i will comply with the villages written and verbal recommendations regarding soil erosion and sediment control i will attend a preconstruction meeting to review my plans for soil erosion and sediment control and will be responsible for notifying the village of bourbonnais building department immediately if any changes occur to the plans schedules etc i certify that the above stated information is true and correct and by submitting this notice of intent to control erosion and sediment i agree that all requirements stated above will be met signature _____ date ____________  ____________  ____________ erosion control for homebuilders village of bourbonnais controlling erosion is easybut important because eroding construction sites are the leading cause of water quality problems in illinois for every acre under construction about a dump truck and a half of soil washes into nearby lakes or streams problems caused by this sediment include increased flooding  sediment buildup lowers the flow capacity of channels causing more frequent flooding in areas that rarely of never flooded in the past water quality impairment  sediment laden runoff transfers nutrients and other pollutants to downstream lakes and rivers degrading aquatic habitats and increasing costs for water treatment erosion control is important even for home sites of an acre or less the material needed are easy to find and relatively inexpensive  straw silt fence stakes gravel plastic tubes and grass seed putting these materials to use in a straight forward process only a few controls are needed on most sites financial burden to taxpayers  sediment that finds its way into streets storm sewers and ditches results in additional maintenance costs for local state and federal governments simple but effective controls include preserving existing trees and grasses where possible  silt fence to trap sediment on the down slope sides of the lot and soil piles  soil piles located away from any road or waterways  gravel drive used by all vehicles to limit tracking of mud onto streets  cleanup of sediment carried offsite by vehicles or storms  downspout extenders to prevent erosion from roof runoff  revegetating the site as soon as possible warning  extra measures may be needed if your site  is within 300 feet of a stream or wetland  is within 1000 feet of a lake  has a waterway or ditch  is steep slope of 12% or more  received runoff from 10000 sq feet  or more of adjacent land  has more than an acre of disturbed ground the fact sheet includes the diagram and stepbystep instructions needed by builders on most home sites additional controls may be needed for sites that have steep slopes are adjacent to lakes and streams receive a lot of runoff from adjacent land or are larger than an acre portions of this document were obtained from a publication by the henry county soil and water conservation district silt fences put up before any other work is done install on down slope enough to allow water to pond behind fence excavate a 6 inches wide by 6 inches deep trench along the contour of the slope an additional 6 inches of fabric should extend along the bottom of the trench in the upslope direction inspect and repair once a week and after every 12 inch rain remove sediment if deposits reach one third the fence height maintain until a lawn is established then remove soil piles locate away from any down slope street driveway stream lake wetland ditch or drainage way place a silt fence around all stockpiles temporary seeding such as annual rye or winter wheat is recommend for piles during fall construction season stabilized construction entrance install a single access gravel drive using 23 inch aggregate lay stone 6 inches deep at least as wide as the ingress and egress 14 feet  minimum and extend from the foundation to the street 30 feet  minimum use to prevent tracking mud onto the road by all vehicles maintain throughout construction sediment cleanup by the end of each work day sweep or scrape up soil tracked onto the road by the end of the next work day after a storm clean up the soil washed offsite downspout extenders not required but highly recommended install as soon as gutters and downspouts are complete to prevent erosion from roof runoff use plastic drainage pipe to route water to a grassed or paved area maintain until a lawn is established storm sewer inlet protection protect onsite storm sewer inlets with silt fences or equivalent measures inspect repair and remove sediment deposits after every storm preserve existing vegetation wherever possible preserve existing trees shrubs and other vegetation to prevent root damage do not grade place soil piles or park vehicles near trees marked for preservation place plastic mesh or snow fence barriers around trees to protect the area below their branches seeding and mulching spread 46 inches of topsoil fertilize and lime if needed according to soil test or apply 25 lbs per 1000 square feet of

development each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land and donate money for public park and recreational uses to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development or a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication or a combination of both at the option of the village in accordance with the following criteria and formulae 1 criteria for requiring park and recreational land dedication and cash payments a requirements and population ratio the ultimate population of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication the total requirement shall be ten acres of land per thousand of ultimate population in a subdivision or planned unit development plus the sum of cash per dwelling unit as outlined in appendix exhibit c appendix exhibit c is not set out herein but is on file and available for inspection in the office of the village clerk in the event the ultimate population of a subdivision or planned unit development will be less than or greater than 1000 persons the amount of land required for dedication will be determined by using the ratio of six acres per 1000 population as the determining standard see appendix exhibit c the money contribution shall be used by the village for park land acquisition park site preparation and construction equipment and other related improvement costs b location a location which will serve the entire development is most desirable in large developments these sites can be located throughout the development c retention requirements land dedication required by this chapter may include land required for drainage or retention purposes pending approval of the village engineer park board and plan commission d credit for private open spaces and recreation areas when subdividers or developers provide their own open space for private use it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public land service depending on the size of the development a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may at the option of the board of trustees be provided in the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space the extent of same shall be determined by the board of trustees based upon the needs of the estimated population and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area in general a substitution of private open space for park and recreation land will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation detailed plans of such areas including specifications of facilities to be installed must be approved by the board of trustees and before any credit is given for private open space areas the subdivider or developer must guarantee in form satisfactory to the board of trustees that those private open space areas will be permanently maintained for such use private swimming clubs are included in this provision when an adjustment for private open space areas is warranted it will be necessary to compute the total park and recreation land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given 2 criteria for requiring a contribution to cash in lieu of park and recreation land where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational land use or when land for park and recreation use cannot be made contiguous to existing or proposed sites as designated by the village master plan the village upon recommendation of the board of trustees shall require the subdivider or developer to pay cash contributions in lieu of the land dedication that would have been required the cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation use shall be held in trust by the village solely for the acquisition of land for parks and recreation which will be available to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing park and recreation facilities within the village which already serve such needs it shall be the policy of the village to use its best efforts to use the cash contributions in the general area of the development for which they were contributed a fair market value the cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated for park and recreation purposes it has been determined that fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the village is as follows $2500000 per acre  and the applicable figure shall be used in making any calculation herein unless the subdivider or developer files a written objection thereto with the board of trustees in the event of any such objection the subdivider or developer shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of in his development or other evidence thereof and a final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the board of trustees based upon such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be obtained by the board of trustees the village park board or others the fair market value shall be reviewed and adjusted annually commencing one year after the adoption of this chapter the board of trustees will review fair market value annually to accurately reflect land value within the village and within the planning jurisdiction of the village in the event that the board of trustees fails to review and adjust the fair market value on an annual basis such value shall automatically increase at a rate of the assessed value of land per annum commencing on each anniversary of adoption of this chapter in any event if the board of trustees fails to review and adjust the fair market value on an annual basis such failure shall not be deemed to invalidate this chapter or any parts thereof appendix a village of bourbonnais schedule of fees per unit for park land donation or cash in lieu of land donation

determined by the village board 3 developers are also required to contribute for equipment and site development as outlined in schedule in column c 3 criteria for requiring dedication and a contribution there will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when a only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for land for park and recreation use that portion of the land within the subdivision or planned unit development falling within the park and recreational use location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated b a major part of the local park and recreation land has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision or development to complete the site the small portion shall be dedicated and a cash contribution shall be required in lieu of any additional land that would have been required for dedication 4 density formula a document entitled population per unitnaperville illinois prepared by associated municipal consultants inc is attached as appendix exhibit c and incorporated herein by reference such table is generally indicative of current and shortrange projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres and land or cash contribution thereof it is recognized that population density age distribution and local conditions change over period of time  therefore the table shall be updated every two years if deemed necessary in the opinion of the board of trustees after passage of this chapter to reflect the latest table published by associated municipal consultants or any comparably reliable source if the board of trustees fails to renew said table and update same such failure shall not be deemed to invalidate this chapter or any parts thereof a subdivider or developer may file with the board of trustees a written objection to the table listed herein in the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to such table he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event a determination of the density formula to be used in calculating the dedication or contribution required herein shall be made by the board of trustees after review of such demographic information 5 reservation of additional land where the comprehensive plan or the designation by the village calls for a larger amount of land for park or recreational use in a particular subdivision or planned unit development than the subdivider or developer is required to dedicate the land needed beyond the subdividers or developers contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase or condemnation by the village in accordance with the applicable requirements of the illinois municipal 6 combining with adjoining developments where the subdivision or planned unit development is less than 40 acres park and recreation lands which are to be dedicated should be where possible and in the best interests of the village combined with dedications from the adjoining developments in order to produce usable park lands and thereby minimize the hardship on a particular subdivider or developer 7 topography and grading the slope topography and geology of the dedicated site as well as its surroundings must be suitable for its intended purpose a subdivider or developer shall allow the village to have access to proposed sites for the purpose of conducting soil boring tests 8 combining park and recreation land and land for a school site wherever possible and whenever in the best interests of the village and the effected

approval of the plat of subdivision resubdivision or final development plan or otherwise provided to the village in the villages sole discretion by agreement between the developer and the village in no event shall the balance due to the village be paid more than three years from the final approval of developers project 2 it shall be the duty of the village treasurer to establish regulations and procedures for the collection and administration of the cash contributions required under this chapter 10 credit for land and cash or contribution of cash in lieu of land given under annexation agreements if a subdivider or developer has given land and a contribution of money or a contribution of cash in lieu of land as part of an annexation agreement and thereafter the subdivider or developer or their successors submit a plan of subdivision or resubdivision or final development plan which will increase the density of population in those areas covered by the annexation agreement then the subdivider or developer shall be required to make an additional contribution of park and recreation land or of cash in lieu thereof as outlined above the additional land or cash in lieu of

activities for the various native landscaping areas installed around and within the pond during the initial three years following installation once this threeyear mark has been reached and all plant assemblages have developed satisfactorily a permanent sitespecific maintenance plan will be developed lowmaintenance fescue  all fescue areas shall be inspected and policed for litter and debris prior to each mowing  mowing should occur approximately once a month to a height of four to six inches care should be taken to never remove more than onethird of the top growth fescue grasses will often produce seedheads in mid to late spring to maintain a more manicured lawnlike appearance mow at four inches when seedheads appear  fertilizer is not recommended for this turf and should be applied sparingly if used at all  once established water only during dry periods occasional thorough soakings are preferred over frequent light sprinklings  all sidewalks curb lines concrete slabs and planting bed edges shall be mechanically edged as needed to maintain a neat clean appearance approximately twice per month low visibility areas such as road shoulders outlying tree circles bed edges etc may be chemically contained but at no time will there be more than onehalf inch of visual desiccated plant growth along the contained areas  trimming shall be performed around all road signs guard posts trees shrubs utility poles and other obstacles paying special care to not damage trees and shrubs the grass to be trimmed shall not be trimmed to less than the desired height of cut determined by the mowing operation natural areas maintenance maintenance for the prairie and emergent wetland areas will be the same for the first three years due to the fact that all of these areas have closely related plant assemblages and will all consistently in the same stage of development as one another for prevention and control of particular nonnative species please refer to the attached vegetation management guidelines appendix a these guidelines detail appropriate methods of control for many of the most common offensive species maintenance for these three areas will be as follows year 1 same year as initial installation spot herbicide control trained applicators shall police entire site to identify and control aggressive nonnative and invasive species applications will be as needed and should be according to recommendations found in the attached vegetation control guidelines site mowing bushogstyle mower should be used to mow all accessible areas to a height of six inches to prevent encroachment of woody species areas too wet for mechanical equipment to access will be avoided two mowing events should occur each year  one in late mayearly june and one in early november year 2 spot herbicide control same as year 1 site mowing initial site mowing should be completed in late mayearly june if sufficient fuel load has developed to conduct a fall prescribed burn then burning should take place in lieu of the november mowing event if sufficient fuel load does not exist then site should be mowed a second time in november enhancement plantings installation of supplemental live plugs will occur in june planting will be performed by qualified contractors as defined under specifications possible supplemental reseeding by late in the growing season of year 1 an accurate assessment of the success of the initial native seeding will be possible if the plant communities are not developing to a level commensurate with the expectations of both the owner and their restoration consultant reseeding will be required the species to be reseeded will either be identical to the original species list or will be selected by a qualified restoration consultant for suitability to the most current site conditions possible prescribed burning if sufficient fuel load has developed the owner shall enlist the services of a trained and experienced prescribed burn contractor to perform a prescribed burn of the prairie and wetland areas of the site if weather conditions allow burning should take place in mid to late november if weather conditions prevent this from occurring the burn shall take place in spring of year 3 year 3 spot herbicide control same as year 1 mowing or prescribed burning same as year 2 after three years of establishment it is expected that the only activity required for prolonged health of the natural areas of the site will be prescribed burning or annual mowing in the fall prescribed burning is the ideal management technique for longterm prairie and wetland health and will be the only form of action required on three to fiveyear intervals to maintain these areas indefinitely the following species are the most likely to invade native establishment areas on the site and should be monitored should any of these appear on the site appropriate control activities should be engaged as described in appendix a vegetation management guidelines prairie

season following installation it is anticipated that plant survival and shoreline colonization of pond and stream emergent species will be highly successful when provided with proper hydrology and substrate conditions these plantings require virtually no maintenance activities the most critical recommended action is to control aggressive cattails which commonly invade the site immediately following initial planting cattail removal should occur according to the following procedure  the cattail stand shall be first treated in mid to late may all cattails shall be cut low to the ground a systemic herbicide shall be applied to the cut cattail stumps with a wicking applicator  for each 1000 feet  2 of cattail stand surface area treated the recommended herbicide and application rate is four and onehalf tbsp 225 fl oz aquatic glyphosate rodeo and 3 tbsp nonionic surfactant x77 or equivalent in two and onefourth gallons of water  if standing water is present cattails shall be cut as low as possible below the water line to attempt to kill the plant by suffocation herbicide shall not be applied to plants that are cut below the water line cattail plants shall not be allowed to progress beyond the early flowering stage  cattail stand maintenance shall continue first growing season as deemed necessary by the wetland consultant depending on the regrowth of the removed specimens this activity is will need to be performed most heavily in the first year some light treatment may be required during the year 2 it is anticipated that following the year 2 season the native plant communities installed in these areas will have developed sufficient densities to outcompete cattails attempting to become established if necessary the year 2 treatment will consist of wick application of standing cattails during early summer utilizing the same glyphosate mix described above iii threeyear monitoringsuccess criteria year 1 owner shall guarantee an average 80 percent aerial coverage of prescribed temporary seed crop and average 20 percent aerial coverage of native permanent seeded and plugged species by the end of the first growing season within all native planting zones year 2 owner shall guarantee an average 45 percent aerial coverage of native permanent seeded and plugged species with 90 percent by number representation of prescribed species by the end of the second growing season year 3 owner shall guarantee an average 80 percent aerial coverage of noninvasive native species throughout all native planting zones with 90 percent by number
