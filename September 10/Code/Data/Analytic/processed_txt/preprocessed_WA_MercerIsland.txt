such a structure will be damaged within three years as a result of shoreline erosion in the absence of such hard armoring measures or where waiting until the need is that immediate would foreclose the opportunity to use measures that avoid impacts on ecological functions thus where the geotechnical report confirms a need to prevent potential damage to a primary structure but the need is not as

island town center tc zone the location and boundaries of which are set forth in micc  and appendix d the mercer island zoning map the general purpose of this chapter is to implement the land use policies of the mercer island comprehensive plan for the area referred to as the town center the development and design standards are not intended to slow or restrict development but rather to add consistency and predictability to the permit review process buser guide the town center is divided into subareas mostly for the purpose of regulating maximum height limits a twostory height limit applies throughout the town center only by providing certain benefits to the community can a development project add additional stories up to the maximum height allowed in the particular subarea these community benefits include affordable housing  green building features  stepping back of upper stories to reduce building mass and maintain light and air  provision of public open spaces as gathering places  and provision of block pedestrian connections to break up larger blocks and enhance pedestrian access ctown center vision the town center vision found in the mercer island comprehensive plan is adopted herein by reference ddesign vision 1development and design standards the development and design standards that follow are intended to enhance the town center for pedestrians and develop a sense of place to accomplish this vision new or redevelopment is encouraged to orient buildings toward the public rightofway with buildings brought forward to the sidewalk or landscaped edge  parking placed behind buildings and in less visible areas or underground  design structures with varied mass and scale modulation of heights and wall planes  and pedestrian block connections that will break up very large or long blocks for improved pedestrian circulation from one side of the block the other side 2function the design of buildings structures and streetscapes within the town center is intended to support a built environment that is convenient and accessible to pedestrians motorists bicyclists and public transit users development should enhance the town center as a vibrant healthy mixed use downtown that serves as the citys retail business social cultural and entertainment center and ensures the commercial and economic vitality of the area new or redevelopment should increase the attractions and pedestrian amenities that bring residents to the town center including local shopping services offices specialty retail restaurants residences festivals special events and entertainment outdoor spaces should function as social settings for a variety of experiences adding to the comfort of life in mercer island while maintaining a human scale and an ability for easy pedestrian circulation 3site features new or redevelopment should include public amenities such as storefronts with canopies street trees greenery seating fountains or water features outdoor cafes sculpture or other forms of art and places for gathering and lingering the use of materials color texture form and massing proportion public amenities mitigation of environmental impacts landscaping

shall be coordinated and consistent with the downtown street standards 4pedestrian orientation pedestrianoriented and customer intensive retail businesses and offices are encouraged to locate on the street level to promote active use of sidewalks by pedestrians thus increasing the activity level and economic viability of the town center new or redevelopment should also enhance and support a range of transportation choices and be designed to maximize opportunities for alternative modes of transportation and maintain individual mobility even with a healthy variety of development in the town center each individual development or redevelopment project shall favor the pedestrian over the automobile in terms of site design building placement and parking locations escale the design of all structures shall consider how the structure and site development will be viewed from the street and adjacent properties scale is not simply the size of the buildings it is the proportion of buildings in relationship to each other to the street and to the pedestrian environment fform building forms shall not present visual mass impacts that are out of proportion to the adjoining structures or that appear from the street or sidewalk as having unmodulated visual mass building additions should complement the original structure in design gstyle the objectives and standards do not set or encourage a particular style of architecture or design theme however building and site design shall be pedestrian in scale and address design features such as sloped roof lines  distinctive building shapes

sign guidelines repealed by  arterial rightofway guidelines concepts image <19appxc_001png> the intent of the guidelines is to develop further goals and objectives synthesized from previous mercer island planning studies the community and the design commission in order to provide a framework within which rightofway improvements may be implemented that will result in a coherent continuous rightofway system representative of the island environment and complementary to its natural character the following goals intentions and criteria constitute a basis for evaluating improvements and development as they may contribute to the overall intended rightofway system classification in consideration of the general environmental characteristics of the island the arterial rightofways have been grouped into three general classifications which are applicable to mercer island rural suburban and urban several of the arterials may have more than a single classification depending on their basic character for the purpose of developing guidelines only the major distinct segments of an arterial have been differentiated because there is general community consensus that the rural characteristics of the island should be retained rightofway development must be evaluated not only on the basis of the prevalent classification for any one arterial but also on the basis of retaining and reinforcing the muchsoughtafter rural image for this reason the suburban segments of any one rightofway should be subordinated to the rural segments and development downgraded accordingly image <19appxc_002png> these arterials have also been assigned route and section numbers by the public works department which are recognized by the urban arterial board as well as an arterial designation of major secondary and collector however since the guidelines deal chiefly with visual characteristics of the rightofway the arterial section designations have been introduced primarily as a means of reference diagrams keying the classification are found with the corresponding guidelines under rural suburban and urban rightofway headings the rural rightofways are generally characterized by continuous vegetation belts ravines hillsides winding roadways group access drives and relative freedom from infringing housing these are the rightofways most highly characteristic of the island environment and provide a unique exposure to mercer island for both visitors and residents this category includes the majority of the mercer ways island crest from se 53rd pl to se 68th the majority of se 53rd pl se 68th east of island crest and gallagher hill rd the suburban rightofways pass dense residential communities d are characterized by closely adjoining housing uniform front yard

as topography generally dictate the type of system that should be provided there are three basic types of bicycle facilities shared rightofway class iii bikeway a mixture of motorized vehicle and bicycle traffic in the same roadway  low vehicular volumes and speeds are a prerequisite bicycle lane class ii bikeway a separately designated facility for bicycle traffic following the alignment of the roadway the separation may be made by curbing striping or buttons as required to insure bicycle safety bicycle path class i bikeway a facility that is separated from motorized vehicles and may or may not parallel the alignment of the roadway bpedestrian facilities pedestrian facilities exist for purposes of commuting recreation exercise health and pleasure and must accommodate a variety of uses for example a facility chiefly in use by children capable of quick erratic movements needs special safety consideration this is particularly applicable in areas where schools parks playgrounds etc are the predominant pedestrian traffic generators likewise surfacing materials must be compatible with the rightofway surrounding landscape topography and drainage conditions pathways may be paved covered with gravel or wood chips or simply left in their natural state eg the pathway network along island crest park owes much of its charm to its meandering unpaved state there are two types of pedestrian facilities that may be implemented within the rightofways sidewalk or lane adjacent to roadway either paved sidewalk or unsurfaced lane path independently aligned and generally landscaped to enhance the walkers experience cjoint bicyclepedestrian facilities in areas where rightofway widths road conditions or grades restrict separate bicyclepedestrian routes a joint facility may be implemented it is particularly appropriate in situations where pedestrian traffic is minimal or grades are such to preclude excessive bicycle speeds a joint facility particularly one designed to accommodate two way bicycle traffic may also be advantageous where excessive pavement widening may not be a desirable rightofway improvement joint bicyclepedestrian lane following the alignment of the roadway either directly adjacent or separated from the roadway joint bicyclepedestrian path independently aligned and separated from the roadway general goals in order to enable a more specific consideration of the design criteria of individual rightofways the general overriding considerations that are applicable to all rightofways are given here as reference for the more specific considerations that follow 1develop rightofways consistent with the overall natural island character and scale with particular consideration given to any uab and highway standards that may diminish the rural quality of the island 2emphasize key intersections and gateways that serve as an introduction to the island by treating them in a manner that is representative of the best of the island environment 3develop views and vistas from the road as a means of locating and orienting the user to the island 4establish a safe and efficient system for all modes of acceptable traffic and encourage public transportation and pedestrianbicycle facilities in appropriate locations particularly in situations where they may serve schools and other public facilities 5accommodate pedestrianbicycle facilities by jointuse such as shared rightofways and joint bicyclepedestrian facilities with minimum widening of the paved surface 6restore the island environment and enhance the street scene by

those areas that are in need of reinforcement or are an obvious break to the continuous vegetation enclosure of the rightof way private easements should be considered wherever buffers within the rightofways are not sufficient to provide the desired roadway enclosure the easements should be planted and maintained by the city for a period of one year 2apreserve existing views and vistas at

turnouts should be surfaced with pervious materials and where location permits should be left as much as possible in their natural state turnouts should be delineated by wood or log tire stops to prevent damage to groundcovers and low planting adjoining the roadway 3aeliminate individual driveways in favor of group access drives in order to minimize disruption of roadways and vegetation 3blimit the width of the road to two lanes with additional pavement width permitted in curved sections where extra width may be required for safety purposes wherever possible extend the plant materials to the pavement edge to further contain the width of the roadway 4astrengthen vistas and important axes by selective clearing elimination of conflicting street furniture elements such as utility poles wiring and fencing and selection and planting of plant materials within the rightofway that will heighten and emphasize the view 5arepair all bank cuts and restore to near natural state

disruption of the rightofway and its adjoining landscape in some instances a continuous separately designated bicycle facility may be extremely difficult to implement pedestrian lanes or pedestrian use of the separated bicycle facility should be considered particularly along those portions of the mercer ways where school traffic or access to public open space trails must be accommodated bisland crest 30 a bicycle path could readily be implemented along the east side of island crest where a sufficient width of cleared rightofway now exists to easily accommodate a twoway bicycle path the setback from the roadway to the path should be planted with native trees and groundcovers similar to those that exist on the west side of the rightofway image <19appxc_005png> the pedestrian path that now exists along island crest park should be maintained because it is of a scale that is appropriate to the natural setting of the island special care should be taken in maintaining and reinforcing the existing trees and groundcovers within this portion of the rightofway to insure that the character of the path which is largely dependent upon its narrow and meandering nature is maintained pedestrian paths south of se 63rd are recommended for the east side of the rightofway adjoining the proposed bicycle path with the pioneer park edge left undisturbed image <19appxc_006png> if portions of this section of island crest are widened to accommodate a turning lane to cross streets extreme care should be taken to preserve the character of the rightofway by retaining the existing vegetation edge along island crest and pioneer parks the roadway pavement should be kept at a minimum width and medians resulting from the turning lanes should be planted with groundcovers and perhaps occasional trees that are in keeping with the existing native materials along the western edge of the rightofway cse 53rd place route 9 except for the western portion of section 920 image <19appxc_007png> that portion of se 53rd pl east of island crest section 910 could easily accommodate downhill bicycle traffic by means of a shared rightofway or a bicycle lane to insure user safety due to the relatively steep grades a separate bicycle facility to accommodate uphill traffic should be implemented a unique opportunity exists for such a facility along the south side of the rightofway which adjoins one of the major island ravines and is uninterrupted by private driveways the uphill bicycle facility could be implemented as a joint bicyclepedestrian path particularly appropriate for joint use due to the slow uphill bicycle speeds a bicycle facility along se 53rd pl due west of island crest section 920 should be implemented to facilitate cross island travel when this arterial is completed every effort should be made to retain the rural character of the upper portion of section 920 this should be the major consideration and for this reason a shared rightofway along this portion of the roadway is recommended a minimal pedestrian lane or path is recommended along this portion of se 53rd pl as a means of accommodating pedestrian school traffic to the adjoining elementary school informal clusters of native trees are recommended along this rightofway particularly along section 910 which should receive substantial tree planting in order to reduce the excessive width of the rightofway and extend the adjoining ravine vegetation within closer proximity of the roadway clusters of trees should also be utilized to separate the roadway from the bicyclepedestrian path groundcovers should be extended to the road and pathway edge with substantial planting se 53rd pl could visually become an integral part of the ravine instead of merely skirting its edge dse 68th and se 70th place the western

gallagher hill rd including sections 310 and 320 image <19appxc_010png> a combination of a bicycle lane and a joint bicyclepedestrian path or lane with maximum separation from the roadway as permitted within the existing rightofway should be adequate to accommodate twoway bicycle travel along se 40th from 92nd se to 70th or 76th se depending upon which route is used as an access to the business district private easements should be considered as a means to provide more generous facility separation and planting buffers the unimproved portion of se 40th should be developed in a similar manner if and when the arterial connection is extended to west mercer way wherever rightofway conditions or easements permit the implementation of a pedestrian path such a facility should be considered where a path is not feasible a lane or a joint bicyclepedestrian path may be implemented with special attention given to the separation of pedestrian and downhill bicycle traffic where high bicycle speeds may be a danger to the pedestrian there is an opportunity along se 40th to introduce occasional street medians which should be planted as a further means of dividing the roadway occasional street trees in informal cluster patterns are suggested for this rightofway both within the median and the planting buffers between the roadway the pedestrian and bicycle facilities and the adjoining property plant materials should be of a type common to the island but may be contrasted with occasional groupings of flowering or ornamental trees special recognition should be given to the plant materials of the adjoining properties and a pleasing transition achieved from the private to the public sector wherever this is appropriate bse 24th street route 12 from west mercer way to 76th se image <19appxc_011png> due to steep grades and relatively high traffic volumes bicycle facilities are not recommended for this arterial pedestrian sidewalks which are suggested for both sides of the arterial may accommodate uphill bicycle traffic an alternate bicycle route bypassing se 24th may be implemented along 72nd se as a means of tying into north mercer way street trees are recommended at approximately 30 feet on center along both sides of se 24th plant material should be of the standard street tree variety such as red maple sycamore oak linden etc the pavement width from 71st se to west mercer way is excessive for a two lane arterial it is recommended that the current width is maintained only to accommodate a left turn lane onto west mercer way with the remainder of the rightofway devoted to planting and pedestrian facilities c72nd ave se route 7 section 710 since closely adjoining residential properties make a separated bicycle facility along this arterial unrealistic a shared rightofway is recommended when the remaining open drainage ditches are covered the pedestrian lanes that now adjoin the roadway are suggested for conversion to paths that are setback from the roadway by a planting buffer wherever feasible informal cluster planting should be implemented within the rightofway or easements secured for planting purposes particularly along sections where the cover has been removed in order to delineate the roadway and provide a measure of screening for the adjoining housing wherever possible cluster planting should be introduced between the roadway and the path to further enhance the walkers experience special attention should be given to the use of informal cluster planting as a means of breaking up the extensive gravelled shoulders that extend from the rightofway onto private property and are used for parking purposes by adjoining residents private easements should be obtained wherever additional planting would aid the streetscape and planted by the city in conjunction with the overall rightofway development d78th ave se route 4 section 410 and that portion of section 420 south of se 32nd image <19appxc_012png> separate bicycle provision may not be necessary for 78th se since 76th se and se 34th may easily be utilized as a designated shared rightofway from se 40th to the business district that portion of 78th se from se 34th to the business district could be designated as a shared rightofway or a bicycle facility could be implemented as part of the development of the mercerdale site to provide access to the business district from se 34th if bicycle traffic is to be routed along 78th se it is recommended that a joint twoway bicyclepedestrian path be implemented along the east side of the rightofway a separated sidewalk and bicycle lane could easily be implemented along the 80 foot portion of the rightofway by limiting the adjoining local access drive to oneway traffic this joint bicyclepedestrian facility could also be implemented to accommodate a oneway bicycle route north with use of 77th pl se as a shared rightofway to accommodate a bicycle route south sidewalks along both sides of the arterial are the recommended pedestrian facilities that portion of se 78th south of se 40th could easily be utilized as a shared rightofway to accommodate bicycle traffic from west mercer way to the business district pedestrian lanes and planting are recommended as in c above an alternate facility may be a joint bicyclepedestrian path along one side of the rightofway se 78th north of se 40th is recommended for street trees and median trees at approximately 30 feet on center plant materials should be an extension of the sycamores red maples and ivy used on se 78th within the business district eisland crest way route 1 section 120 image <19appxc_013png> due to the high traffic volume and speeds along island crest a bicycle lane or path or a joint bicyclepedestrian lane or path is recommended in both cases these facilities are recommended for consolidated twoway traffic in order to minimize the pavement expanse and provide optimum rightofway landscaping present use patterns suggest that a sidewalk along the west side in combination with a twoway joint bicyclepedestrian lane or path along the east side of the rightofway may be sufficient to accommodate the traffic along this portion of island crest this joint bicyclepedestrian facility may not be possible north of approximately se 42nd unless additional easements are obtained due to the existing 60 foot rightofway by routing the bicycle traffic along 86th se where a joint twoway bicycle lane can be quite easily accommodated this northern portion of the island crest rightofway could be generously landscaped the joint twoway bicyclepedestrian facility along the east side could be developed into an informal meandering lane to accommodate not only bicyclepedestrian traffic but also bus stops seating and occasional turnouts for bicycle rest stops with generous planting buffers from the roadway uninterrupted median street trees are recommended along island crest at approximately 30 feet on center from se 40th to approximately se 42nd of a type mentioned in b above providing left turn traffic can be accommodated image <19appxc_014png> occasional medians to allow left turns to crossstreets are feasible from merrimount dr south to se 53rd pl planting is recommended to be informal clusters of trees common to the island and complementary to the natural forest edge on the west side of the arterial informal cluster planting in the planting strips is recommended for both sides of the rightofway with occasional groupings of ornamental or flowering trees plant material should be located so as to best delineate the roadway buffer adjoining housing and reinforce the existing vegetation an alternate of street trees at approximately 30 feet on center should be considered from se 40th to merrimount dr in order to define the roadway along this stretch which is significantly devoid of trees particularly along the east side in this case the informal cluster median planting would commence just south of merrimount dr particular attention should be given to the selection of plant material along the west edge of the rightofway for it should reinforce the remaining natural forest edge ie big leaf maple douglas fir western red cedar and bitter cherry image <19appxc_015png> groundcovers should be native to the island and relatively maintenance free such as ivy salal and red fescue field grass wherever rightofway groundcover areas adjoin private property effort should be made to achieve a pleasing transition by the use of compatible materials or if appropriate by the extension of the adjoining groundcover areas within the rightofway fse 53rd place route 9 western portion of section 920 only this western portion of se 53rd pl should be developed in keeping with upper 53rd pl as a shared rightofway or it may be developed to accommodate a bicycle path or lane pedestrian lanes or paths should be extended to west mercer way particular care should be taken to insure that vegetation cover is restored along this rightofway and all bank cuts properly replanted it is recommended that informal cluster planting be utilized within the rightofway as well as any easements obtained for planting purposes attention should be given to maximum screening of residential driveways in order to maintain continuity with the rural portions of 53rd pl to the east natural

route 10 sections 1020 and 1030 a joint bicycle pedestrian path or separated bicycle and pedestrian paths are recommended for the south side of se 68th adjoining the shopping center the former could very easily be accommodated within the rightofway without relocation of existing roadway whereas an easement would be necessary to implement the latter under the same conditions the separate pathway system is recommended for consideration since it would leave the natural edge of pioneer park undisturbed which may in time develop into a pedestrian pathway network similar to that now existing along island crest park and it would concentrate the pedestrianbicycle activity adjacent to the shopping center a joint bicyclepedestrian lane is recommended along the east side of 84th se to facilitate access to the shopping center and to serve the junior high school this may be extended as a path or lane along the south side of se 72nd to west mercer way or an alternate may be used of an uphill bicyclepedestrian lane with shared use of the rightofway for downhill bicycle traffic street trees are recommended for the south side of se 68th trees may be at approximately 30 feet on center and of the standard street tree types as mentioned in b above or may be informally planted in the planting strips separating the roadway and the bicycle and pedestrian facilities in keeping with pioneer park special care should be taken to maintain and reinforce the tree cover along pioneer park median street trees and planter strip trees are suggested along both sides of 84th se at approximately 30 feet on center from the eastern driveway of the school to se 68th with ivy or native grass suggested for use as groundcover street trees may be planted an the property line bordering the sidewalk along the west side of 84th se without disrupting the existing sidewalk se 72nd is suggested for informal cluster planting along the strip separating the roadway and the pedestrian or bicyclepedestrian lane along the south side groundcovers should be in keeping with adjoining properties as in e above hse 70th place route 10 eastern portion of section 1010 along se 70th pl the bicyclepedestrian facilities

recommended along this rightofway as a means of extending the natural forest edge which now dominates at the northwest intersection with island crest planting of native groundcovers within the rightofway is suggested as a means of further delineating the road and pathways these should be planted to the roadway edge jportions of mercer ways route 2 northern half of section 210  portions of route 6 sections 620 and 640  route 5 segment of section 510 bicyclepedestrian facilities should be developed in keeping with the adjoining rural portions of the rightofway with particular attention given to the need for pedestrian and bicycle paths in areas where school traffic must be accommodated the segments of mercer ways classified as suburban are lacking tree cover enclosure and are very apparent disruptions to the continuity of the rural roadway experience planting is of particular necessity along these segments it should reinforce the remaining forest edge where this is appropriate and in the more developed areas such as section 210 informal cluster planting of native materials is recommended as in c above of particular concern is the lack of landscaping in that portion of the

street furniture image <19appxc_019png> public signing lighting and other street furniture concepts image <19appxc_020png> public signing street furniture and lighting elements should reinforce and clarify the predominantly natural informal residential character of the island instead of dominating or detracting from it appropriate street furnishings can do much to make the island environment more legible expressive pleasant and engaging as well as establish a sense of place about the island as a whole or a particular area within it public signing can more effectively and uniformly reveal the function form and activities of the island and clarify its overall environment outofcontrol signing lighting and furnishings ones that are in conflict with the surroundings obscure the meaning of the environment as often as they clarify it public signing street furniture and lighting should be evaluated on the basis of 1 does it detract from the overall environment and 2 does it provide the type of information which clarifies and reinforces the environment of mercer island and provides the necessary guidance and orientation to the user guidelines public signing shape and color are the primary means of distinguishing the type of message for the driver in motion the basic shapes are 1 the circle mandatory rules  2 the rectangle guidance speed regulations and curb usage  and 3 the diamond warning two nonconforming signs are the octagonal stop sign and the triangular yield sign shape combined with color indicate a specific class of message the red circle is used for prohibiting signs ie no entry no parking etc the green circle is used for permitted turning rules the yellow diamond indicates warning blue rectangles give local guidance and green rectangles are used for distant guidance the use of symbolic signs as patterned after the international traffic symbols is gaining acceptance in this country the 1971 manual on uniform traffic control devices shows increased reliance on symbols with minimal word use as a transition toward a more uniform and better understood system of symbolic signing there is no doubt that symbols once accepted by the general public offer greater clarity and legibility than the current lengthy verbal directives in use because properly designed symbolic signing is more readily perceived and comprehended than its verbal counterpart the number of necessary signs may be significantly reduced mercer island is in a sense a fairly remote community that does not receive a great deal of outside traffic and for this reason has the need for relatively few public signs as compared to a community such as burien or renton which cater to a great number of outside visitors this has a distinct advantage not only in keeping signs to a minimum but also in introducing changes to an existing signing system curb usage signs image <19appxc_021png> curb usage signs no parking bus stop loading etc although classified as regulatory signs are not as important to traffic safety as other regulatory and warning signs and thus offer a chance to introduce purely symbolic signing without compromising user safety the diagonally slashed red circle is an internationally accepted prohibitive symbol and is included in the manual as acceptable signing for prohibiting truck and bicycle entry the slashed circle in conjunction with perhaps limited wording may be used as the basis for most of the curb usage signing needed within the business district see diagrams warning signs warning signs are primarily placed for the protection of the driver who may not be acquainted with the road conditions which may be potentially dangerous warning signs indicate crossings curves impending signals slippery conditions etc the majority of warning signs are diamond shaped with a black legend and yellow background they are often used in conjunction with a rectangular verbal guidance sign other regulatory signs other than the curb usage signs previously discussed the major regulatory signs applicable to the island are the stop yield speed limit and turning signs see diagrams the signing for i90 is not addressed by these guidelines guide signs guide signs are used to inform the motorist of interesting routes destination parks trails historic sites etc because of the great familiarity of most users with the island and its facilities most standard guide signs are not needed on the island and their use should be discouraged in order to maintain roadside signs to a minimum guidelines goal encourage the development and use of an overall uniform signing system in keeping with national safety standards and representative of the island community that will intent 1emphasize symbols as opposed to the worded message 2lend itself to combined or joint mounting so that the overall numbers of separate parts and separate signs may be reduced 3lend itself to a uniform system of mounting 4utilize light standards as supports for signing and light signalization where appropriate 5be legible at the speed and distance at which it is placed to be seen 6employ minimum sizes as determined by safety requirements criteria curb usage signs curb usage signs pertain mostly to the business district there are various other locations on the island where no parking signs are used but they are relatively few bus zone symbols may be used island wide stopping or standing regulations may be particularly applicable at schools and other public facilities the spacing of no parking signs should not exceed 150 feet and should in all cases be governed by what is a reasonable sight distance in each particular situation no parking signs should be placed so that they are readily apparent from cross streets that enter in midblock signs may occur at random spacing as determined by visibility and available mounting within the business district two signs per block may suffice image <19appxc_022png> parking and other curb usage signs should be incorporated as part of the signing mounted on light standards within the business district and in all other locations where possible in order to keep the number of upright posts at a minimum the no parking signsymbol may be the dominant element on all curb usage signs with other uses such as truck load bus zone taxis only etc indicated by word message as part of the no parking sign symbols may be used to specifically indicate the permitted usage for a bus zone taxi zone etc that are based on the open green circle which is the standard symbol signifying permitted use an alternative approach to posting no parking areas within the business district would be to post only those limited areas where parking is allowed providing a general no onstreet parking signsymbol is adequately displayed or incorporated as part of the gateway signing at key entry points to the business district in this case the positive green circle would be the basic symbol employed no parking designations within the business district may also be incorporated by means of curb markings striping or by the use of the slashed red circle symbol as part of the curb shoulder in this case the no parking designation should be used at approximately 4050 foot intervals reflector buttons for medians should be made a part of the curb use of upright reflector mounts should be discouraged warning signs the use of warning signs should be kept to a minimum because their unnecessary use tends to lessen their impact this is particularly true in the case of mercer island where the majority of motorists are very familiar with existing conditions low speeds as well as a uniform consistent uncomplicated backdrop such as that along the majority of the rightofways present additional reasons for further reducing warning sign usage and sign size image <19appxc_023png> the color coding and diamond outline are of particular importance for easy identification of these signs while the image in this case is of secondary importance wherever safety considerations permit the size of all signs and accompanying verbal guidance should be reduced in size as permitted by the manual on uniform traffic control use of symbols that offer greater legibility along with smaller size should be employed warning signs for trail crossings should be combined with actual trail signs wherever possible particularly along the rural rightofways the incorporation of the diamond warning symbol and verbal guidance message as a part of a rectangular background should be considered for it has distinct advantages for establishing a uniform mounting system and for the incorporation of additional signs regulatory signs the majority of regulatory signs are rectangular with the long axis being vertical two notable exceptions are the octagonal stop sign and the triangular yield sign minimum size standards have been established for both stop and yield signs which are permitted on low volume local streets and secondary roads these should be employed throughout the island where their use is necessary turning signs should employ the green circle with arrow symbol as opposed to the purely verbal black and white signs turn prohibition signs should employ the red circle image <19appxc_024png> speed limit signs should be kept at minimum permitted sizes and where permissible they should be combined with other roadside signing guide signs the only guide sign currently in use is the bicycle route sign marking an officially designated bicycle trail the use of these signs will most likely increase as new bicycle trails and types of facilities are developed new symbolic signing may be developed for bicycle route markers as well as designated viewpoints or trailheads signing should be kept at minimum sizes used only where essential to differentiate the facility or identify its location and mounted jointly with other signing wherever possible mounting all signing should be uniformly mounted signs should be mounted in conjunction with lighting standards and should be integrated with other signing wherever possible signs should be mounted in conformity with height and setback requirements upright posts should be of wood stained in dark or neutral colors the back sides of all oneface reading signs and metal mounting frames should be anodized or painted to closely match the color of the wood street name signs a distinct well designed system of street name signing could do much to give mercer island special identity the mounting and upright post should be compatible with that used for other public signing the letter type should be picked for legibility and clarity value contrast as opposed to color should be emphasized to facilitate readability another alternative would be to incorporate the message dead end or an appropriate symbol as part of the street name sign with no change in color a graphic symbol that is representative of the island could be incorporated into all street name signs and used consistently to graphically convey mercer island in other locations such as the gateway signing to the business district an alternate to the use of the diamond dead end signs could be the color coding of street name signs for those streets that terminate as dead ends for example all name signs could be dark brown with white lettering  all dead end name signs could be signal yellow with black lettering crosswalks the major pedestrian crosswalks within the business district should be indicated by a differentiation of pavement as opposed to striping the pavement should be complementary to that used for adjoining sidewalks as well as pavement within the future town square which the majority of these crossings adjoin it is the intent that paving within the town square as well as other pedestrian precincts be of a unit type material such as concrete pavers brick tile etc lighting image <19appxc_025png> goal provide safety for vehicular traffic and pedestrians intent provide the amount and quality of light as recommended by recognized standards while satisfying the other goals included here within the business district an average of 12 fc may be used which is the ies handbook recommendation for major roadways in business districts not classified as downtowns an average rating is not significant the minimum level and contrast between minimum and maximum as perceived over time is more important particularly along the rural rightofways incident light along commercial streets is a significant contributor to the amount of light perceived by the driver or pedestrian and should be considered as part of the overall light level criteria image <19appxc_026png> alight levels the minimum light level provided by street lights within the business district at a point furthest away from the light source should not be less than 2 fc and the maximum should not exceed about 5 fc the average levelof light should be approximately 12 fc to 2 fc including a maintenance factor of 60 percent bincrease lighting levels at intersections crosswalks and driveways to 2 times minimum that of the remainder of the street or about 4 fc average at intersections within the business district light should be uniform at intersections and of a contrasting color to midblock areas goal enhance the directional quality of the street intent 1give character and scale to the street and emphasize the street corridors directional quality pattern scale of the light standards and increased light levels at points of increased decision making for the driver 2reduce area wide lighting and restrict it to the corridor 3focus on the enhancement of the landscape and reinforce ones perception of the streetscape as a continuum of related elements building a total image criteria 1aemphasize the street as a corridor by focusing the lighting totally on the street and pedestrian ways minimize spillingover light onto adjacent properties except at driveways 1bat intersections and along major pedestrian routes in the business district add pedestrian lighting integrated with the street lighting system light fixtures should be at a comfortable height to the pedestrian approximately 1015 feet high 1cemphasize the lighting at intersections by changing the color of the light to warmer tones either by changing the type of lamp or the color of the lens 2lighting standards should be not more than 2024 feet high between intersections and 2833 feet high at intersections in the business district and along urban rightofways rural rightofway standards should not exceed 16 feet  suburban rightofways should not exceed 22 feet the lighting fixtures and standards are elements of a continuum of parts constituting the streetscape including trees signs roadway automobile and people which together form a spatial territory subjectively not measurably if the lights are raised above their critical heights they go beyond the bounds of the territory break the tension formed between parts and disassociate themselves from the other elements the road user at this point no longer perceives the lights as a cooperative part of the total streetscape 3aplacement of lights should complement street tree spacing 3blight underneath portions of the trees with approximately 10 percent uplight of the street lighting system this portion may be increased as the trees mature goal relate lighting to other public elements of the street intent reduce the number of competing elements in the streetscape and design relate in terms of common or complementary materials systems and scale the lighting system to traffic signals signing and street furniture criteria acombine the traffic signals on the same standard or standard system as the general intersection lighting bintegrate signing street signing and directional signals with the lighting standards throughout the business district at major intersections and at other locations if appropriate call light standards should be of the same material preferably wood doverhead traffic signalization should be kept at a minimum street furniture goal develop furnishings that are compatible and consistent with the surrounding streetscape and the overall island environment intent 1provide appropriate street furnishings where needed 2encourage pedestrian use of the rightofway 3enhance the street scene criteria the street furniture elements addressed by these guidelines are bus shelters seating guardrails bollards fire hydrants signal control boxes and trash receptacles bus shelters bus shelters should be installed at major collecting points where sufficient use justifies their location or at locations that are served by several transit routes joint use between public and school transit stops should be encouraged bus shelters should not occur on highly developed residential streets or restricted rightofways where they may infringe on adjoining private development shelters should be sited to give easy access and visibility of the rightofway protection from prevailing weather rain and sun seating should be incorporated as part of the shelter for the business district or at other major locations appropriate trash receptacles should be provided the existing bus shelter in the 4800 block of east mercer way is an excellent example of a rural shelter in terms of materials scale color and orientation it is of a sufficient size to provide adequate protection from the weather it incorporates seating its roof form is pleasing and in keeping with residential housing and it has a sense of overhead structure that implies shelter the scale and color of the structure are good due to the use of natural unit materials the above criteria should be applied to the development of future bus shelters or a prototype shelter for the island bus stop locations within the business district should be located to take advantage of the existing shelter and seating provided by adjoining buildings such as the national bank of commerce this particular type of pedestrian oriented street frontage development should be encouraged throughout the district in which case the bus shelters would not be a necessity the location of separate shelters within the business district as it exists may only reinforce the preponderance of very small structures and very large parking lots seating seating may be incorporated into the proposed joint pedestrianbicycle paths proposed along arterials such as island crest way to serve transit and school bus patrons or as resting stops for bicyclists pedestrians etc care should be taken to locate seating sufficiently set back from the roadway and in areas where it does not conflict with adjoining development materials should be of wood either natural or stained in dark or neutral colors guardrails guardrails that are used for street ends undeveloped rightofways and other similar locations where their use is more symbolic than safetyoriented should be of wood either natural or stained in dark or neutral colors reflector buttons may be incorporated as part of the guardrail for nighttime visibility in locations where wood guardrails do not suffice because of safety requirements a planting hedge may be employed as a visual screening device where screening is not feasible corten may be employed as the rail if existing speed limits are maintained on the island the use of such guardrails should be limited to island crest way and i90 bollards bollards may be used for marking street ends roadways and undeveloped rightofways particularly where unimpeded pedestrian traffic is desirable bollards may be used as a means of separating bicycle and vehicular traffic where curbing is not appropriate and may be employed at intersections that are crossed by bicycle pathslanes as a means of preventing vehicle entry bollards should be of wood either natural or stained in dark or neutral colors bollards used for the protection of fire hydrants should be left as natural concrete with the use of reflector buttons for nighttime visibility the use of bollards to protect stop signs or other signage posts should be kept to a minimum  where bollards are absolutely essential for safety purposes they should be treated as above fire hydrant hydrants should be uniformly painted hydrants within the business district should be undergrounded signal control boxes control boxes should be located to allow screening by planting buffers trash receptacles trash receptacles should be incorporated as part of the overall streetscape elements their main use would be in the business district at bus stops and shelters and other public facilities receptacles should be of a size that does not dominate the streetscape elements and should conform to the state litter control law they should be attached to existing light standards or other appropriate elements and should be free of the ground metal perforated metal or wire mesh may be used color may be chosen to blend with existing street elements or used as a contrast to them general guidelines for public quasipublic and multifamily dwellings
