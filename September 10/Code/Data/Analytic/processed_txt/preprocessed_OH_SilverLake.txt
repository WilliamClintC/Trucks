charter  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen building fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any

to vary the application of certain provisions of this zoning order that the public health safety convenience comfort and general welfare may be safeguarded and substantial justice may be done it is the applicants burden to establish the hardship in each case the following are reasons to grant a variance awhere unreasonable hardships would result from the literal application of the provisions of this hardships which are unavoidable such as theoretical loss or limited possibilities of economic advantage are not unreasonable hardships likewise hardship based on conditions created by the owner is not an unreasonable hardship it must be found that there are peculiar and special hardships as applicable to the property involved which are separate and distinct from general hardships in the district  and bwhere exceptional circumstances or conditions only applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the property exist and do not apply to other property within the same district  and cwhere granting a variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located the mere existence of an unreasonable hardship or other exceptional circumstance is not itself conclusive evidence for granting of a variance for such hardship must be balanced against the present conditions and extent to which such a variance would interfere with the rights of adjacent property owners and the appropriate future development of those properties  and dwhere the granting of a variance will not be contrary to the purpose intent and objectives of this variance merely permits that which is contemplated in this unreasonable hardships and exceptional circumstances in responding to an area variance eg setbacks height it is the applicants burden to prove that an area zoning requirement unreasonably deprives him of a permitted use of his property ie the owner must show he has encountered practical difficulties in the use of his property while no single factor controls in determination of practical difficulties the factors to be considered and weighed include but are not limited to 1whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the variance  2whether the variance is substantial  3whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a substantial detriment as a result of the variance  4whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of governmental services eg water sewer garbage  5whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of the zoning restriction  6whether the property owners predicament feasibly can be obviated method other than a variance  7whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance passed 6694  110908 lapse of variances aif after the expiration of 6 months no substantial construction has occurred in accordance with the terms and conditions for which a
