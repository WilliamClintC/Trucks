buffer zone resource areas shall be protected regardless of whether they border surface waters the 150foot buffer zone set forth in this chapter is necessary because land is a limited resource in watertown the vast majority of watertowns land has been previously developed because of this level of development a natural riparian buffer is absent there is a high percentage of impervious surfaces which causes a greater amount of runoff and there is less opportunity for natural recharge and natural processes to attenuate pollutants in the runoff thus this buffer zone is needed to help further mitigate activities that may be detrimental to the resource areas cwithout limiting the foregoing and as an additional local requirement no person shall build or enlarge any structure parking lot or

presume the riverfront area is important to all the resource area interests unless demonstrated otherwise and no permit issued hereunder shall permit any activities unless the applicant in addition to meeting the otherwise applicable requirements of this chapter has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that 1there is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with less adverse effects  and 2that such activities including proposed mitigation measures will have no significant adverse impact on the areas or interests protected by this chapter the commission shall regard as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use overall project purpose eg residential institutional commercial or industrial logistics existing technology costs of the alternatives and overall project costs fto prevent resource area loss the commission shall require applicants to avoid alteration wherever feasible  to minimize alteration  and where alteration is unavoidable and has been minimized to provide full mitigation the commission may authorize or require replication of wetlands as a form of mitigation but only with specific plans professional design proper safeguards adequate security and professional monitoring and reporting to assure success because of the high likelihood of failure of replication gthe commission may require a wildlife habitat study of the project area to be paid for by the applicant whenever it deems appropriate regardless the type of resource area or the amount or type of alteration proposed the decision shall be based upon the commissions estimation of the importance of the habitat area considering but not limited to such factors as proximity to other areas suitable for wildlife importance of wildlife corridors in the area or actual or possible presence of rare plant or animal species in the area the work shall be performed by an individual who at least meets the qualifications set out in the wildlife habitat section of the wetlands protection act regulations 310 cmr 1060 hthe commission shall presume that all areas meeting the definition of vernal pools under  15402 of this chapter including the adjacent area perform essential habitat functions this presumption may be overcome only by the presentation of credible evidence which in the judgment of the commission demonstrates that the basin or depression does not provide essential habitat functions any formal evaluation should be performed by an individual who at least meets the qualifications under the wildlife habitat section of the wetlands protection act regulations iif in its consideration of an application or request for determination the commission determines in its discretion that the area is deemed not likely to be significant to the interests protected by this chapter the commission shall inform the applicant in writing that the work does not require a permit

with 516d in determining such increases the spga may seek input for advisory purposes from the conservation commission environment and energy efficiency committee department of public works and other town departments boards and commissions 5 development of opportunity sites development of desirable uses at key opportunity sites as outlined in the corridor plan may receive increases to the maximum allowable building coverage far andor height in accordance with 516d design guidelines intent and purpose design guidelines have been adopted to address the design of new buildings along the major corridors and watertown and coolidge squares they are intended to enhance building parking and the public realm interface focusing on the following four principles 1 economic vitality watertowns design guidelines were created to enhance the economic vitality of selected commercial areas consistent design by following these guidelines each project will complement another resulting in a cohesive development over time the guidelines were developed specifically to provide direction for the design of new infill development in commercial areas the goal is not to limit creativity but rather to recognize potential for architectural diversity while adhering to the overarching principles contained herein they intend to define expectations for new development while allowing for flexibility and fostering high quality design 2 historic preservation urban regeneration means more than simply building a new  historic preservation is an effective economic development strategy the reuse and regeneration of existing buildings should be encouraged in addition to new development as they provide a direct connection to watertowns past existing buildings that have retained cultural or architectural significance can form the basis for economic development and growth 3 design aesthetic the design guidelines cannot depict every possible building configuration on each site rather a prototypical building footprint is shown in a manner that accommodates many conditions that emerge on a project site the massing is general enough that it can contain a range of uses but specific enough to highlight the critical areas of concern even when closely following these guidelines each project will take its own form that will differ from the example shown a singular design aesthetic in watertown is neither viable nor desirable 4 environmental performance new development comes with the obligation to implement sustainable design and construction practices that incorporate technological innovation and green 73 building practices and ecological site design development will strive to address the highest sustainable and ecological principles using advanced green technologies and materials and promoting highperformance buildings stormwater management practices must prevent flooding and erosion and protect the health of the charles river and local streams and ponds using green infrastructure approaches where feasible new buildings should be constructed with local lowembodied energy materials and constructed with the highest standards for environmental sustainability regionalmixed use district rmud watertowns design guidelines were created to enhance the economic vitality of selected commercial areas consistent design the commercial corridors and squares of main street pleasant street galen street north beacon street mt auburn street and arsenal street are being positively impacted by the design guidelines and standards as they are clarifying expectations about what development should look like and raising the quality of construction as the towns primary commercial corridor the eastern portion of arsenal street has some of the largest retailers in the region with sufficient private and public infrastructure this area warrants greater density in light of the size of the geography and its catalytic and transformative potential for the region the scale of development in this area merits greater height massing and signage requirements for new construction commensurate with its role as a regional attraction and destination a intent and purpose the regional mixed use district rmud has been enacted to assist promote and guide the orderly conversion and redevelopment of the arsenal street corridor the establishment of the rmud is intended to accomplish the following objectives 1 facilitate transformative development consistent with watertowns goal to promote mixed use development that includes a mix of larger and smaller scale retail office hospitality multifamily residential and research and development uses and that serves regional demand 2 allow development at a density scale and character appropriate to define a corridor that is a major gateway for the town  additional height may be appropriate in such gateway locations where consistent with watertowns economic development goals and the adopted design guidelines as they may appropriately apply to development in the rmud  additional density andor reduced parking space requirements may be appropriate in the district where consistent with the goal of reducing traffic congestion and improving multiuser transit services and in compliance with any transportation demand management policy adopted by the town 3 enhance the quality of life including promoting the development of a high quality public realm o which is aesthetically pleasing and consistent with watertowns design guidelines o that provides a wellarticulated pedestrian environment which implements complete street concepts and adopted complete streets policies o that promotes porous frontages which create connections to surrounding neighborhoods and the charles river o which includes public art 4 enhance publically available open space networks by connecting to and integrating with adjacent state municipal and privatelyowned parcels where appropriate encouraging private land owners to permanently preserve open space being sensitive to the charles river reservation and furthering private remediation and public access to sawins brook and pond and williams pond 5 respect historic assets and architectural features that help define the character of the community and encourage preservation and restoration of historic buildings 6 incentivize real estate investment that will enhance the diversity and maximize the value of the towns tax base 74 7 use green building practices that encourage energy efficiency manage stormwater protect the riparian habitat and are planned designed constructed and managed to minimize adverse environmental impacts 8 encourage development that accommodates and promotes multimodal access transit between the arsenal corridor and mass transit stops management of transportation demand to reduce automobile use and mitigates deterioration of the level of affected intersection service for all transportation modes 9 facilitate the development of a continuum of housing options that o supports residences within walking or cycling distance to employment and leisure uses o promotes and maintains a diverse housing stock and opportunities for lower and middleincome households and o enhances a transition between arsenal street and the abutting residential neighborhoods while discouraging residential development
