enforce private agreements or maintain a record of such agreements how long does it take to get a building permit  consult with the building official the timeframe for receiving a building permit is dependent on various factors accuracy and completeness of information have major effects on application review time as well as the fluctuations in the seasonal work load the type and extent of structural work can also impact the length of time needed to review and potentially approve a building permit application how do i determine the current zoning of my site  check the zoning district map refer to the adopted zoning district map available from the building official the published zoning map is periodically updated however you may want to verify the zoning shown on the map with the

plans or future intent for a site the comprehensive plan land use map might changes in zoning that are consistent with the comprehensive plan land use map are usually favored by the p&z commission and

in areas subject to flooding these areas include those that are defined as zones a ae ah ao ar and a99 as depicted on the most recent flood insurance rate map firm produced by the federal emergency management agency fema the purpose of the overlay district is to minimize potential loss of life destruction of property and the use of public funds for costly flood control projects b statutory authorization the legislature of the state of north dakota has in north dakota century chapters 4047 1133 and 5803 or as may be amended delegated responsibility to local governmental units to adopt

the flood hazard areas of the city of beulah are subject to periodic inundation which can endanger life result in loss of property create health and safety hazards disrupt commerce and governmental services cause extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impair the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 flood losses caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the special flood hazard areas cause increases in flood heights and velocities inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise unprotected structures also contribute to flood loss d statement of purpose it is the purpose of this subsection to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed  1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of special flood hazard areas so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area  and 8 to ensure that those who occupy the special flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions e methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this zoning methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to flood including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas f lands to which this this subsection shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the city of beulah g basis for establishing the special flood hazard areas the special flood hazard areas identified

a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subsection 241o1 or conflict with existing laws or ordinances e any applicant to whom a
