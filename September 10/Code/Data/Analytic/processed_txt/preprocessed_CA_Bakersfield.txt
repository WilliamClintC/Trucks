such as proposed design approach life cycle cost project features and functions the award shall be made to the designbuild entity whose proposal is judged as meeting the best interest of the city and meeting the objectives of the project eprior to contracting for the procurement under designbuild the public works director shall iprepare a program setting forth the scope of the project that may

the computation of sign area and sign height aarea of individual signs single face the area of a sign face which is also the area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face shall be computed by means of the smallest measurable polygon that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing representation emblem color logo or other display together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the background or structure against which it is placed if a sign is composed of individual letters or symbols with no added decoration the total sign area shall be calculated by measuring the area of each individual letter andor symbol  the combined areas shall be the total sign area barea of multifaced signs the sign area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of a single sign face pursuant to subsection a of this section when sign faces are placed back to back or in a way that only one face can be viewed from any point and when such sign faces are part of the same structure and are not more than two feet apart the total sign area shall be computed by measuring one of the faces if they are all of equal area or the largest face if they are of unequal area cstructural support area the area of a sign does not include any supporting framework bracing or other support whether or not it has been architecturally treated provided said support does not exceed twentyfive percent of the allowable sign area for a pylon sign and fifty percent of the allowable sign area for a monument sign if the support area exceeds these percentages any excess shall be computed as part of the total sign area dsign height the height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign including any of its structural support at grade as defined in this title to the top of the highest component of the sign   sign location restrictions asigns shall not be placed on

standards shall apply to all outdoor lighting installed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in chapter aoutdoor lighting must be fully shielded and aimed downward fully shielded denotes lighting fixtures that are shielded focused or constructed so that light rays do not project horizontally or vertically the shield must be arranged in such a manner that light rays emitted from the device or fixture whether directly from the lamp or indirectly from the fixture are projected below the horizontal plane at the lowest point on the fixture where the light is emitted the light must be aimed to ensure that the illumination is only pointing downward onto the ground surface with no escaping light permitted to contribute to sky glow by shining upward into the sky examples of acceptable and unacceptable lighting fixtures are shown in bposttop luminaries which may also be referred to as period lighting or historical lighting shall have builtin reflectors that effectively eliminate uplighting cany outdoor lighting that shines onto adjacent property or streets that produce a nuisance or disabling glare or that is above the horizontal plane shall not be permitted dlight trespass that extends beyond the property or project boundaries within or adjacent to residentially zoned andor designated properties shall not exceed an intensity level of 05 footcandles at the property line as measured three feet above the ground or finished grade this light intensity maximum shall also apply to lands zoned andor designated agriculture parks and open space elight fixtures mounted under a canopy shall be recessed so that lighting is fully shielded by either the roof or canopy fascia and is projected below the horizontal plane as stated in subsection a of this section lights shall not be mounted on either the top or sides of a canopy fuplighting is only permitted if it is effectively contained and will not shine beyond the intended target into the night sky containment of lighting may include but is not limited to overhanging architectural elements such as eaves or awnings or landscaping such as dense shrubs or dense evergreen tree canopies goutlining of a building by means of

unnecessarily high energy costs the following recommendations are intended to encourage the efficient use of energy for lighting purposes aall nonessential outdoor commercial and residential lighting should be turned off after business hours when it is not necessary for public safety or when an activity needing such light is not in use blighting levels may be reduced after hours to provide minimal visibility without compromising security cwhere practical outdoor lighting installations should include timers dimmers sensors or photocell controllers that turn the lights off during daylight hours to reduce overall energy consumption and eliminate unnecessary lighting sensor activated fixtures should not be triggered by activities off the subject property dwhen selecting new outdoor lighting the full cost of operation over the life of the fixtures should be considered substantial annual energy savings may be realized by using quality efficient fixtures and light sources the lowest wattage for the intended task and alternative sources of power such as wind or solar when feasible eindiscriminate and excessive lighting should be avoided light should be directed only where it is needed when it is needed with the appropriate intensity   exemptions the following are exempt from the provisions of this chapter atraffic control signals and devices  btemporary emergency related lighting
