the mcminnville municipal code prepared by the municipal technical advisory service institute for public service the university of tennessee in cooperation with the tennessee municipal league june 1994 change 5  ii city of mcminnville tennessee mayor norman rone vice mayor everett brock aldermen rick barnes clair cochran jimmy haley jr medley billy wood recorder shirley durham iii preface the mcminnville municipal the codification and revision of the ordinances of the city of mcminnville tennessee by referring to the historical citation appearing at the end of each section the user can determine the origin of each particular section the absence of a historical citation means that the section was added by the codifier the word modified in the historical citation indicates significant modification of the original ordinance the code is arranged into titles chapters and sections related matter is kept together so far as possible within the same title each section number is complete within itself containing the title number the chapter number and the section of the chapter of which it is a part specifically the first digit followed by a hyphen identifies the title number the second digit identifies the chapter number and the last two digits identify the section number for example title 2 chapter 1 section 6 is designated as section 2106 by utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and chapter of the code together with the cross references and explanations included as footnotes the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any question that might arise however the user should note that most of the administrative ordinances eg annual budget zoning map amendments tax assessments etc do not appear in the code likewise ordinances that have been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here therefore the user should refer to the citys ordinance book or the city recorder for a comprehensive and up to date review of the citys ordinances following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures if any prescribed by the citys charter the code has been arranged and prepared in looseleaf form to facilitate keeping it up to date mtas will provide updating service under the following conditions 1 that all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which should be added to the code are adopted as amending adding or deleting specific chapters or sections of the code see section 8 of the adopting ordinance 2 that one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a separate ordinance book and forwarded to mtas annually 3 that the city agrees to reimburse mtas for the actual costs of reproducing replacement pages for the code no charge is made for the consultants work and reproduction costs are usually nominal when the foregoing conditions are met mtas will reproduce replacement pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such iv ordinances this service will be performed at least annually and more often if justified by the volume of amendments replacement pages will be supplied with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code complete and up to date the able assistance of sandy selvage and bobbie sams the mtas word processing specialists who did all the typing on this project and tracy

overall operation and maintenance of the potw including employee safety protection of the collection system and the treatment plant effluent quality and sludge use and disposal given these responsibilities the superintendent will have authority to issue administrative orders terminate service conduct show cause hearings and initiate judicial proceedings 4 control authority attorney the control authority attorney advises technical and managerial personnel on enforcement matters and orchestrates the judicial responses deemed necessary by the superintendent consequently the attorney should be consulted on all matters requiring the interpretation of the sewer use resolution and the enforcement response plan many control authorities have attorneys prepare model novs and administrative orders which may with simple modifications be easily issued by technical staff in addition many control authorities also routinely copy the attorney with administrative orders and fine assessments since further responses against the user may involve judicial action 1982  as replaced by #116  1 sept 1995 18204 determining time frames for enforcement actions and followup in order for an enforcement action to be effective it must be timely for an action to be timely the violation must be detected and responded to promptly after its occurrence therefore review of compliance reports for both effluent violations and timeliness shall be a high priority at the time of their submission the control authority staff shall review industrial user reports within five 5 days of receipt violations observed by control authority field personnel may receive even swifter attention no more than thirty 30 days shall be allowed to elapse between the detection of the violations and the initiation of an enforcement response if the appropriate response is an informal warning or an nov the response time may be much shorter for example a nov should be sent to the noncompliant user within a week of the violations detection after its initial enforcement response the control authority shall closely track the industrial users progress toward compliance for example the control authority should not wait several weeks to determine whether a compliance schedule milestone has been met or to verify that a report which was 1813 to be submitted within ten 10 days of receiving a nov was in fact submitted instead the control authority shall make this determination on or about the milestone date one method to ensure that user compliance is closely tracked is to increase the frequency of user selfmonitoring for instance an administrative order may increase selfmonitoring from once per quarter to once a month similarly the control authority is own inspections of the users facility may be increased until consistent compliance is demonstrated these followup compliance activities shall begin no later than thirty 30 to forty five 45 days after initial enforcement response is taken when followup activities indicate that the violation persists or that satisfactory progress is not being made the control authority shall escalate its enforcement response these followup enforcement actions shall be taken within sixty 60 to ninety 90 days of the initial enforcement action the model enforcement response guide presents time frames in which enforcement actions shall be taken 1982  as replaced by #116  1 sept 1995 18205 applying the enforcement response guide a comprehensive enforcement response guide designates several alternative enforcement options for each type or pattern of noncompliance the control authority personnel who detect noncompliance need only select an appropriate response from the short list of enforcement options indicated there are a number of factors to consider when selecting a response from among these options  good faith of the user  compliance history of the user  previous success of enforcement actions taken against the particular user eg if novs have not previously succeeded in returning the user to compliance an administrative order is the more appropriate response  violations effect on the receiving waters  violations effect on the potw since the remedies designated are all considered appropriate the control authority must weigh each of the above factors in deciding whether to use a more or less stringent response the control authority shall consistently follow the response guide to do otherwise sends a signal to industrial users and the public that the control authority is not acting in a predictable manner and may subject the control authority to charges of arbitrary enforcement decision making thereby jeopardizing future enforcement the following pages present a model enforcement response guide for the control authority this guide identifies types of violations indicates initial and followup responses and designates personnel and time frames for these responses 1982  as replaced by #116  1 sept 1995 1814 18206 using the model enforcement response guide the enforcement guide is used as follows 1 locate the type of noncompliance in the first column and identify the most accurate description of the violation 2 assess the appropriateness of the recommended responses in column two first offenders or users demonstrating good faith efforts may merit a more lenient response similarly repeat offenders or those demonstrating negligence may require a more stringent response 3 apply the enforcement response to the industrial user specify corrective action or other responses required of the industrial user if any column three indicates personnel to take each response and the time frame in which that response shall be taken 4 followup with escalated enforcement action if the industrial users response is not received or violation continues the control authority should remember to maintain all supporting documentation regarding the violation and its enforcement actions in the industrial users file 1982  as replaced by #116  1 sept 1995 18207 description of terms terms and abbreviations used in the model guide are defined below ao administrative order civil litigation civil litigation
