be submitted as part of the plan approval andor land disturbance permit process to the city of newnan planning department these plans will be reviewed by the city landscape architect for compliance with the city of newnan zoning this article in particular and either approved denied or returned for revisions any comments will be made available to the designer for response or revision to the drawings the plans shall then be resubmitted along with previous red line comments with the necessary changes following the same procedure as if it were an original application issuance of a land disturbance permit is contingent upon approval of the tree protection planlandscape plan 2 procedures a all tree protection measures shall be installed prior to any land disturbance and the city landscape architect shall be contacted for a preconstruction conference prior to any land disturbance to adequately protect the site tree save areas shall be delineated in the field with tree protection fencing land disturbance may proceed only after a permit is obtained and tree protection measures have been installed and approved by the city landscape architect the city landscape architect will conduct unscheduled inspections during construction to ensure compliance with the approved tree protection plan the city landscape architect shall have the authority to stop work on a development if site activities do not comply with the approved tree protection plan andor this article b a tree removal permit is required to remove any tree larger than eight inches in diameter from any property there will be a fee for obtaining a tree removal permit based on the number of trees to be removed some tree removal permits may be granted without a tree removal fee in accordance with section 10849 of this article if any significant trees are removed from any property without a tree removal permit the property owner shall pay a fine of three times the tree removal fee calculated minimum required site tree densities must be maintained at all times failure to maintain the required tree densities may result in replantings c any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the city landscape architect will be replaced by trees equaling a two times an inch for inch replacement of the tree removed the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be threeinch minimum caliper size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is no evidence of its condition such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the city landscape architect d in the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 60 months following completion of development the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees threeinch minimum caliper having an inch for inch replacement of the specimen tree removed on the site as approved by the city landscape architect failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this article e an approved tree protectionlandscape plan must be implemented prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy when the developerowner has installed the required landscaping improvements he shall request an inspection by the city landscape architect if the city landscape architect approves the installation the developer will then post a twoyear landscape establishment bond after the landscape establishment bond has been received the project will then be released for the issuance of a certificate of occupancy if the city landscape architect does not approve the plan he shall submit a report stating his reasons for disapproval so that the developer can make the necessary corrections after the corrections have been made a reinspection shall be requested f at the end of the twoyear landscape establishment period the city landscape architect shall inspect the site and shall make a determination of whether or not the required trees and landscaping are healthy and have a reasonable chance of surviving to maturity upon such finding the bond shall be released in absence of such finding the bond shall not be released and the owner of the property shall be notified to replace the unhealthy trees and landscaping or take other appropriate action as approved by the city landscape architect upon failure of the owner to comply with the city landscape architects decision regarding such trees the city shall use the bond to the extent necessary to bring the property into compliance final inspection shall be scheduled within ten working days notice g trees which are used to meet the tree density requirements shall be fully maintained for an additional five years after the date of final landscape establishment inspection it is the responsibility of the property owner to water fertilize and treat trees in order to maintain tree health and vigor the property owner shall at all times maintain the required tree density failure to maintain the required tree density factor at any time during the life of the project shall be a violation of this article trees which have been used to meet the tree density requirements shall not be removed at any time without approval of the city landscape architect removal of such trees will result in replacement of like kind and size h it shall be the duty of the city landscape architect to enforce the provisions and requirements of this article the city landscape architect shall have the authority to revoke suspend or void any land disturbance permit and shall have the authority to suspend all work on a site or a portion thereof i land clearing for clearly agricultural purposes including legitimate timber harvesting  plant or tree nurseries  orchards is exempt however this exemption shall not be interpreted to include tree harvesting incidental to the development of land or tree harvesting on land that is anticipated to be developed for non horticultural uses all legitimate timber harvesting shall be required to provide a 50foot undisturbed buffer provided and maintained along the entire perimeter of the property including road frontages during the land disturbance activity except for authorized access crossings once tree harvesting takes place in conformity with the above regulations no development of the property shall be permitted that would require the cutting of trees preserved for a period of five years following the timber harvesting no timber harvesting shall be undertaken on any non residential parcel of land unless the transitional buffer zones required by the zoning regulations of the district in which located are preserved in a natural and undisturbed state   62603  tree preservation and protection the trees in newnan are a city resource worth protecting and maintaining existing trees shall not be disturbed except as outlined in this article no person shall cut carve or otherwise damage any tree no person shall attach rope wire nails or advertising posters to any tree no person shall set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree any large rare or historically significant trees on a project site shall be highlighted by the designer see specimen trees section 10846 it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees reasonable effort shall include but not limited to alteration of building design alternate building location parking area detention area drainage system or relocation of utilities careful thought and consideration is expected to be given to saving trees in the development process in the plan review process of a proposed project the first indicator of how well trees have been incorporated in the design process is how will the proposed development impact specimen trees these trees are considered on an individual basis and a proposal to remove any of them is carefully scrutinized another indicator is how will the proposed development impact smaller significant trees these trees are typically considered in mass as they relate to the overall preservation of the natural character of the site removals which are not adequately justified may require site plan alterations the following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward meeting the site density factor on a property 1 planning considerations tree space is the most critical factor in tree protection throughout the site development process the root system can easily extend beyond the dripline of the tree canopy the root system within the dripline region is generally considered to be the critical root zone disturbance within this zone can directly affect a trees chances for survival to protect these critical root zones the following planning considerations should be applied a the use of tree save islands and stands is encouraged rather than the protection of individual nonspecimen trees scattered throughout a site this will facilitate ease in overall organization as related to tree protection b the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees or otherwise designated tree save areas shall include no less than the total area beneath the trees canopy as defined by the furthest canopy dripline of the trees c tree preservation and grading requirements are two design constraints which are most often in conflict a grade change of a few inches can be detrimental to a tree yet most sites require extensive cut and fill in order to manage drainage the use of berms or retaining walls instead of cutting to provide detention can be used to preserve significant trees detention ponds can be designed around significant trees by adding depth to minimize width where possible retaining walls can also be used to mitigate cuts and fills tree wells andor aeration systems can also be provided for trees in areas of fill d underground water and wastewater lines storm sewers irrigation lines and both underground and overhead electric and telephone lines can have a considerable impact on trees the layout of the project site utility plans should accommodate the required tree protective zones utilities should be placed along corridors between tree protective zones developers shall coordinate the location of utility lines including irrigation and electric lighting with the utility companies in order to prevent root damage within the critical root zones of protected trees and to minimize damage to trees located in protected zones e construction activities such as parking material storage concrete washout burnhole placement etc shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protective zones no disturbance shall occur within the protective zone of specimen trees or stands of trees without prior approval of the city landscape architect f sidewalks often appear innocuous on plans but can be very detrimental to trees due to grading requirements considerations should be given to move sidewalks as far from tree trunks as possible and provide a finished grade above the existing grade for sidewalks required in close proximity to a tree trunk drainage can be routed under sidewalks where an elevated grade is required 2 protection of existing trees a tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to trees including but not limited to 1 soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy equipment vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic or storage of equipment or materials  2 root disturbance due to cuts fills or trenching  3 wounds to exposed roots trunks or limbs by mechanical equipment  4 other activities such as chemical storage cement truck cleaning fire etc b trees identified to be preserved and counted as credit towards meeting required site tree density shall have a four foot tree protection fencing installed at the critical root zones for methods of tree protection see section 10843ag all tree protection measures shall be installed prior to the start of any land disturbance and maintained until final landscaping is installed no construction activities are to occur within tree protection areas areas designated for parking materials and equipment storage or staging areas are to be located outside of the drip line of existing trees c the city landscape architect will conduct periodic inspections of the site before work begins and during clearing construction and post construction phases of development in order to ensure compliance with these regulations and the intent of this article tree protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of development failure to comply with andor maintain approved tree protection measures may result in a stop work order issued by the city landscape architect 3 methods of tree protection the root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone most trees can tolerate only a small percentage of critical root zone loss to protect these critical root zones a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained the following section describes ways to help control unnecessary encroachment on existing trees these methods and guidelines will be followed for tree protection throughout all phases of construction these guidelines are designed to reduce damage to critical root zones and wounds to exposed roots trunks and limbs by chemical mechanical and other means tree protection areas will be delineated on tree protection plan and methods of protection will be clearly noted and detailed a active protective barriers barriers shall be installed along the outer edge of and completely around the critical root zones of all specimen trees or stands of trees or otherwise designated tree protective zones prior to any land disturbance deviations from this must be approved on an individual basis by the city landscape architect barriers will be a minimum four feet high constructed in a post and rail configuration a twoinch by fourinch post and a oneinch by fourinch rail with the post no further than six feet apart is recommended chain link fence with the same post spacing is also acceptable all tree protection zones should be designated as such with tree save area signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced in area all tree fencing shall be maintained throughout the land disturbance and building construction and should not be removed until all construction and landscaping is complete b passive protective barriers tree save areas and their critical root zones not within 60 feet of any grading storage construction or traffic areas may be protected by four foot orange laminated plastic safety fencing passive tree protection fencing is to be used only for areas remote from construction activity c boring no open trenching will be allowed within the protected zone as defined by the protective barricades all underground utilities to be installed within this protection zone shall be installed by boring underneath the root zone any exceptions must be approved by the city landscape architect utilities may be tunneled in the root zone at a 24inch minimum depth providing that plans are approved showing the location and method d fillingclearing within root zone fill dirt no deeper than two inches may be allowed within the drip line of the tree no grubbing is permitted in the root zone in the protected root zone any stumps dead trees and shrub growth to be removed shall be cut flush or ground out stump grinding will be accomplished with equipment and methods acceptable in normal arboriculture operations all holes will be backfilled completely the same day of the operation e soil compaction where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials storage the tree protection zone must first be mulched with a minimum fourinch layer of shredded hardwood mulch or a sixinch layer of pine straw f clearing activities roots often fuse and tangle amongst trees the removal of trees adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees wherever possible it is advisable to cut minimum two foot trenches eg with a ditch witch along the limits of land disturbance so as to cut rather than tear the roots trenching may be required for the protection of specimen trees the cutting down and then grinding the stump of the adjacent removed trees as opposed to bulldozing them and ripping their roots can also aid the protected trees g tree removal to minimize potential root loss from soil disturbance in an overlapping root situation all roots attached to a tree inside a tree save area that extend outside the tree save areas shall be cut by hand if the soil is to be disturbed the removal of any tree adjacent to a tree within a tree save area shall not be removed by heavy equipment cutting the roots by hand or with a ditch witch is acceptable 4 tree protection plan any proposal for development or improvement of any tract of land shall include a tree protectionlandscape plan including trees to be planted in order to meet the minimum requirements of this section such plan shall be submitted along with other permit drawings to the city of newnan building department prior to any clearing grubbing grading or other removal of the existing vegetation that may affect the health of existing tree coverage no tree removal shall occur prior to approval of the tree protection plan the tree protection plan may be submitted as part of the landscape plan provided that all required information is legible or as a separate drawing which includes as a minimum the following a name address and phone number of owner of record and applicant b boundary lines of the tract by lengths and bearings streets adjoining the property total area of the tract land lot land district north point graphic scale and date c approximate location of all specimen trees and tneir critical root zones indicate those specimen trees proposed for removal or for preservation removal of specimen trees is subject to city landscape architects approval d approximate location of all trees or stands of trees proposed to be protected only trees that are designated on the tree protection plan will be counted towards density requirements e exact location of specimen trees when their preservation is questionable or might result in a change of the site design f location of proposed buildings structures and paved areas g locations of all existing and proposed utility lines utility lines must be placed along corridors between critical root zones of trees which will remain on the site h limits of land disturbance clearing grading and trenching i limits of tree protection areas showing trees to be maintained and planted specifying species and size j grade changes or other work adjacent to a tree which would effect it adversely with drawings or descriptions as to how the grade drainage and aeration will be maintained around the tree k methods of tree protection shall be indicated for all tree protection zones including tree fencing erosion control retaining walls tunneling for utilities aeration systems transplanting staking signage etc l procedures and schedules for the implementation installation and maintenance of all tree protection measures m plan should indicate staging areas for parking materials storage concrete washout and debris burn where these areas might affect tree protection n the required site tree density factor must be satisfied compliance shall be clearly demonstrated on the tree protection plan existing trees or stands of trees used in the density calculation must be clearly indicated on the drawing a summary table of the number of existing trees to remain and new trees to be planted by diameter shall be shown along with the calculations showing tree density achieved for the site o additional information as required on a case by case basis this could include but is not limited to a certified arborists appraisal of the trees viability and projected life span p the following notes shall be indicated on both the tree protection plan and the grading plan in large bold letters 1 contact the planning department at 770 2542354 to arrange a preconstruction conference with the city landscape architect prior to any land disturbance 2 all tree protection measures shall be installed and inspected prior to the start of any land disturbance and maintained until final landscaping is installed call the planning department at 770 2542354 for an inspection by the city landscape architect 3 no parking storage or any other construction activities are to occur within tree protection areas 4 a maintenance inspection of trees will be performed after two full growing seasons from the date of the final construction inspection project owners at the time of the maintenance inspection are responsible for ordinance compliance 5 determination of site density factor a all projects within the city of newnan with the exception of the construction of individual single family and detached dwellings shall maintain or exceed a minimum site density factor of 16 units per acre the term unit is not synonymous with tree the density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved planting new trees in accordance with the minimum standards of this article or some combination of the two all trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be inventoried the site density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development minimum tree site density shall be calculated and established pursuant to the formula and analysis set forth in this section the trees both retained and new where feasible shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve results following professional landscape standards b individual single family lots within platted residential subdivisions with less than two units per acre are required to plant four shadecanopy trees that are at least eight feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches fifty percent of the required planting shall be placed in the front yard all residential lots shall require that improvements be located so as to provide minimum disturbance to the natural topography of the site and protection to the maximum number of trees c where the proposed development area is so dense that the minimum site density factor can not reasonably be achieved the development area shall be reduced by removing parking spaces in excess of the minimum number of spaces required by zoning placing additional planting islands within the development area or reducing the area to be occupied by buildings d in order to qualify for tree replacement density credit all canopyshade replacement trees shall be at least eight feet tall planted and have a trunk of not less than two caliper inches all understoryflowering replacement trees shall be at least six feet tall planted and have a main trunk of not less than one and onehalf caliper inches multi stemmed canopy trees shall count only the largest trunk for caliper all multistemmed understoryflowering replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes each with a minimum oneinch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet all evergreen replacement trees shall be at least a sevengallon size six feet tall planted and have a main trunk of not less than one and onehalf caliper inches all tree formed multistemmed evergreen replacement trees shall have a minimum of three canes each with a minimum oneinch caliper extending clear at least to a height of four feet and be pruned as tree form at time of planting no more than 40 percent of any one genus may be included in any replanting plan the minimum required quantity of trees on a site after development must produce a total site density factor sdf of 16 units per acre the site density factor sdf is determined as follows sdf   total site area in acres  16 credit for existing trees proposed to be retained on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees by diameter times the units assigned in table 2credit for existing trees credit shall be given all trees retained on a property having a diameter of ten inches or more except trees located in a required zoning buffer only 50 percent of tree credits may be calculated from areas located in the floodplain or delineated as wetlands credit for new trees proposed to be replaced on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees by diameter times the units assigned in table 3credit for replacement trees credit shall be given all new trees replaced on the property except for new trees of less than one and onehalf inches in diameter and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer the number of new trees planted is determined as follows using table 2credit for existing trees calculate the existing density factor edf of trees threeinch diameter dbh or

from the site density factor sdf rdf   sdf  edf example procedure for calculating the required replacement density factor rdf step 1   calculate the site density factor sdf by multiplying the number of site acres by 16 example   185 acres  16   2960 units step 2   calculate the existing density factor edf of trees that will remain on site to be protected during construction edf is determined by converting the tree diameter dbh of individual existing trees to density factor units using table 2credit for existing trees these units are then totaled to determine the edf for the site example   a total of 12 trees will remain on the 185 acre site in step 1 the trees include  3  12 pines  4  18 oak  3  20 pine  2  24 oak when converted to density factor units using table 2 we arrive at the following values dbh no of trees  units total 12 3  08 24 18 4  18 72 20 3  22 66 24 2  31 62 adding together the units of all remaining trees the sum total of units   2240 units since the existing density factor edf is less than the required site density factor sdf then replacement trees are required the minimum site density factor sdf for a 185 acre site established in step 1 has not yet been met step 3   calculate the replacement density factor rdf by subtracting the existing density factor edf step 2 from the site density factor sdf step 1 rdf   edf  sdf example rdf   2960 edf  2240 sdf 2960  2240   720 rdf step 4   the replacement density factor rdf can be converted back to caliper inches using table 3credit for replacement trees any number or combination of transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density factor units will equal or exceed the replacement density factor rdf example   on the 185 acre site the following number and size of trees will be planted as replacement trees number size species  density factor   total units 07 15 dogwood x 04   280 06 20 red maple x 05   300 02 40 red oak x 07   140 adding together the units of proposed replacement trees the sum total of units   720 units proposed replacement units of 720 is equal to the replacement density factor rdf of 720 units thus minimum replacement requirements have been met use table 3credit for replacement trees to determine the number and size of trees that must be planted any combination of transplantable size trees can be used so long as their total density factor units equal or exceed the rdf replacement trees must meet the minimum landscaping requirements set forth in section 10852 table 3credit for replacement trees rdf conversion from tree caliper in inches

of this article tree calipers are measured at one and onehalf feet above the ground or at any point below that for new trees or multi trunked species but in no case less than six inches from the ground existing trees proposed to be retained and new trees proposed to be planted in order to meet the buffer requirements of the zoning conditions of zoning special use or variance approval shall not be considered in fulfilling the requirements of this section concerning site tree density factors buffer requirements are considered to be in addition to the minimum site tree density requirements see appropriate zoning district classification for any additional landscaping or buffering requirements 6 specimen trees some trees on a site warrant special consideration and encouragement for preservation these trees are referred to as specimen trees trees unique due to age size species or historic relevance are to be identified during the survey process and special consideration must be made to work around them it is required that all reasonable efforts be made to save specimen trees reasonable effort shall include but not limited to alteration of building design alternate building location parking area detention area drainage system or relocation of utilities these trees are to be identified and highlighted on the tree protection plan design of buildings hardscapes and utilities are to be developed with consideration to preserving and featuring specimen trees tree density unit credits are given for existing trees that are saved during the site development process with greater credits given to specimen trees in order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these trees into the design of projects additional density credit will be given for specimen trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such purpose credit for any specimen tree thus saved for such purpose would be two times the assigned unit value in table 2credit for existing trees the following criteria are used by the city to identify specimen trees both the size and condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify a size criteria 1 large hardwoods oaks poplars sweetgums etc 24inch diameter or larger 2 large softwoods pines deodar cedar etc 30inch diameter or larger 3 small trees dogwoods redbuds sourwoods etc eightinch diameter or larger b condition criteria 1 life expectancy of more than 15 years 2 relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay 3 no more than one major and several minor dead limbs hardwoods only 4 no major insect or pathological problem a lesser sized tree can be considered a specimen tree if in the judgement of the city landscape architect 1 it is a rare or unusual species or of historical significance 2 it is specifically used by a builder developer or design professional as a focal point in a project or landscape 3 it is a tree with exceptional aesthetic quality 7 replacement of specimen trees in the event any specimen tree should be removed during the land development process the applicant shall be required to replace any specimen tree being removed with suitable replacement trees elsewhere on the site removed specimen trees shall be replaced by species with potential for comparable size and quality tree replacement in addition to the minimum required tree density shall be required in recompense for the removal of specimen trees specimen trees that are removed must be replaced by trees minimum threeinch caliper with a inch for inch replacement of the specimen tree removed to determine if the replacement is reasonable the city landscape architect shall consider intended use of a existing tree coverage size and type b number of trees to be removed on the entire property c number of trees to be saved on the entire property d area to be covered with structures parking and driveways e grading and drainage requirements f character of the site and its environs any tree designated on the tree protection plan to be saved which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction as determined by the city landscape architect shall be replaced with a tree or trees equal to the unit value of the tree damaged however any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equaling an inch for inch replacement of the tree damaged in the event any specimen tree or trees should not survive more than 60 months following completion of development the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees threeinch minimum caliper having an inch for inch replacement of the specimen tree removed on the site as approved by the city landscape architect any specimen tree which is removed without appropriate review and approval of the city landscape architect must be replaced by trees equaling a two times an inch for inch replacement of the tree removed the owner of the property shall be required to replace said tree or trees with replacement trees which will be threeinch minimum caliper size alone will determine whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there is not sufficient evidence of its condition such action may also result in a stop work order issued by the city landscape architect 8 relocation of trees a trees to be relocated shall be removed with a root ball sized in proportion to their calipers root balls shall be 12 inches in diameter for each oneinch of tree caliper trees four inches in caliper and smaller are to be measured six inches from the ground trees four inches to eight inches caliper are measured 12 inches from the ground trees eight inches caliper or larger

line shall have tree barriers placed around it in accordance with the plan c trees to be transplanted off site in full leaf shall be covered entirely with a protective cloth covering prior to transporting trees transplanted on site require no covering d trees which are to be relocated in areas to be graded are to be stockpiled stockpiled trees shall be well heeled in and protected from excessive wind and sun the contractor shall provide water to maintain a healthy condition e where a tree is to be removed under the provisions of this article the city may with consent of the property owner relocate the tree at the citys expense to cityowned property for replanting either for permanent utilization at the new location or for future use at another city property f credit may be given to the property for each relocated tree as though the tree was proposed to remain on the property if the tree is relocated to a site designated by the city at the ownerdevelopers expense 9 removal of trees there will be a fee for obtaining a tree removal permit based on the number of trees to be removed however the removal of trees other than specimen trees from an owner owned single family lot are exempt from provisions of this article provided that the removal does not reduce the required tree density of the lot below the minimum requirements homeowners who remove trees on their own residential property without cost of a person or company engaged in removing the trees for a fee shall not pay any fee until they remove more than five trees at a time within a single calendar year if a contractor is employed to remove trees a tree removal permit shall be required for removing trees eight inches or larger in diameter tree removal conducted on property regardless of zoning

buffers by establishing buffer zone requirements and by requiring authorization for any such activities b findings whereas the city council of the city finds that buffers adjacent to streams provide numerous benefits including 1 protecting restoring and maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity of streams and their water resources  2 removing pollutants delivered in urban stormwater  3 reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation  4 protecting and stabilizing stream banks  5 providing for infiltration of stormwater runoff  6 maintaining base flow of streams  7 contributing organic matter that is a source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem  8 providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable aquatic habitat  9 providing riparian wildlife habitat  10 furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity  and 11 providing opportunities for the protection and restoration of greenspace i 3805 definitions buffer means with respect to a

the area surrounding an unnamed stream flowing from areas west of interstate 85 generally easterly under stillwood drive fairway drive and horizon hill this stream for the purposes of this policy is hereafter referred to stillwood creek the study was conducted by the city due to drainage complaints upstream of stillwood drive and in anticipation of upstream future developments based on the analysis of the watershed a number of properties within the area have been shown to be at potential risk of flooding from large storm events in order to ensure that future developments do not further exacerbate the potential for flooding of downstream properties the city hereby adopts the following requirements for this basin these requirements shall only apply to those lands that drain to the roadway culverts under horizon hill approximately 440 feet southwest of the intersection of horizon hill and eagle court hereinafter the stillwood creek watershed drainage basin these requirements shall not apply to those properties within the watershed that would not normally be required to develop stormwater management measures as outlined in the citys post construction stormwater management purpose of this policy is to supplement the citys post construction stormwater management of the newnan ordinances where a conflict arises between the requirements in this policy and the requirements of the aforementioned ordinance the stricter requirements shall apply 2 predesign recommendations the following outlines the process for developing a stormwater management plan as required for issuance and maintenance of a site development permit in newnan georgia within the stillwood creek watershed drainage area predesign phase step 1 prepare concept site plan step 2 prepare a downstream

residential density 1 yield plan applicants for osd districts shall determine the standard permitted density according to the underlying zoning district use of a yield plan such yield plans consist of conventional lot and street layouts and must conform to the citys regulations governing lot dimensions land suitable for development for example not including wetlands or floodplains street design and parking although such plans shall be conceptual in nature and are not intended to involve significant engineering costs they must be realistic and not show potential house sites or streets in areas that would not ordinarily be legally permitted in a conventional layout 2 mapping of primary conservation areas pca in order to prepare a realistic yield plan applicants need to first map the primary conservation areas on their site typical yield plans would include at minimum basic topography at 5feet intervals location of wetlands 100year floodplains slopes exceeding 20% watershed buffers and setbacks and soils unsuitable for development as indicated on the mediumintensity maps contained in the coweta county soil survey published by the usda soil conservation service b density bonuses 1 density bonus to endow maintenance fund the city may allow up to a 10% density bonus to generate additional income to the applicant for the sole purpose of endowing a permanent fund to offset continuing costs of maintaining the undivided open space mowing meadows or lawns woodland vine control insurance premiums tax payments etc including any active or passive recreation facilities spending from this fund should be restricted to expenditure of interest in order that the principal may be preserved assuming an annual average interest rate of 5% the amount designated for the endowment fund shall be at least 20 times the estimated annual maintenance costs such estimate shall be prepared by an agency firm or organization with experience in open space management acceptable to the planning commission because additional dwellings over and above the maximum that would ordinarily be permitted on the site may reasonably be considered to be net of development costs and represent true profit 75% of the net selling price of the endowment lots shall be donated by the applicant to the open space maintenance endowment fund for the preserved lands within the subdivision this fund shall be transferred by the developer to the designated entity with ownership and maintenance responsibilities such as a homeowners general development standards osd2 655 association a land trust or the city at the time this designated entity is created when estimating the projected maintenance costs of the undivided open space it is not necessary to include land that is not accessible by the subdivision residents for their common enjoyment in such cases the density bonus shall be adjusted proportionately to reflect the acreage that is accessible to residents for their passive or active recreation and not being used for other uses by another party 2 density bonus for public access applicants for new residential developments involving 10 or more dwelling units shall be required to set aside 5000 square feet of land for each proposed new dwelling unit as undivided recreational land designated for public usage such land shall be suitable for active andor passive recreation with at least half the land suitable for active sports where such facilities are required by the city in lieu of a setaside for public usage two alternatives exist for the applicant proposing subdivision involving 10 or more dwellings 1 the applicant may offer a setaside limited to recreational usage by the residents of the proposed subdivision if land is set aside in this manner for private recreational use it shall also be permanently protected conservation easement enforceable by the city andor a land trust prohibiting future nonrecreational or commercial recreational uses 2 the applicant may offer to pay a fee to the city in lieu of any recreational land set aside situations in which it would be appropriate for the city to accept such offers include cases where the land would not provide a particular public benefit because of its small size or location exceptions to this rule where public use of relatively small land areas would still be appropriate include situations in which the land could be used to buffer or extend public parks or public school grounds or could provide potential linkage in a future city trail network the decision whether to accept a feeinlieu offer by the applicant shall lie with the planning commission which shall also establish the amount of the fee in lieu based upon the citys estimated cost of acquiring land that is similar in area and attributes which would better serve public recreational needs in appraising alternative sites the city shall be guided by the site selection criteria contained in its open space plan such estimates shall be based on discussions with realtors or appraisers familiar with land values in the city all such fees collected shall be deposited in an interestbearing account earmarked for recreational land or facility provision by the city and the applicant shall be informed of the use to which the fee will be put general development standards osd2 656 in open space developments with fewer than 10 dwelling units where there would be no particular benefit accruing from a public dedication as described above the recreational land that is part of the 50% or 60% requirement for undivided open space shall be designated for private shared recreational usage among the subdivision lot owners 3 density bonus for meeting additional recommended criteria as further developed d there are six required criteria that must be met for an open space development in addition four of eight recommended criteria must be met for developments that meet more than the required four recommended criteria an additional 2% density bonus shall be granted for each additional criteria met 4 density bonus for open space provision the core concept of this development type is the density bonus granted for the dedication of open space which shall be applicable to all lands not dedicated as open space each open space type has a specific density bonus or allowance see c for additional information c type and location of dedicated open space open space shall be comprised of two types of land primary and secondary conservation areas all lands within these conservation areas are required to be protected by a permanent conservation easement prohibiting further development and setting other standards safeguarding the sites special resources from negative or incompatible change the location of open space conserved method of development shall be consistent with the policies contained in the open space and recreation element of the comprehensive plan and with the recommendations contained in designing open space subdivisions a practical stepbystep approach by randall arendt the type of land that shall be designated as permanent open space not to be further subdivided and protected conservation easement recorded and held by the city or by a recognized land trust or conservancy shall be as specified below 1 open space in primary conservation area open space in the primary conservation area pca is determined by deducting the following kinds of unbuildable land which are also required to be deducted when calculating net permitted density for conventional subdivisions as well 1 wetlands as shown on the official wetlands map published by the georgia department of natural resources 2 all floodway and floodway fringe areas within 100year floodplain as shown on official fema maps 3 land with slopes exceeding 20% or soils unsuitable for building general development standards osd2 657 4 land under permanent easement prohibiting future development including easements for drainage access and utilities 5 all lands located within a watershed protective buffer that are within the 100year floodplain are classified as wetlands or have a slope exceeding 20% 6 a density credit of 50% shall be awarded for all lands included within this classification these environmentally sensitive resources listed above form the core of the open space that is required to be protected the purpose of assigning the above referenced density to pca land is for the valid public purpose of protecting environmentally sensitive lands and resources including watershed buffer and setback areas from the negative effects of development 2 open space in secondary conservation area secondary conservation areas sca shall be those otherwise buildable areas that have natural or historic features deemed worthy of protection secondary open space typically includes all or part of the following types of resources mature stands of native hardwoods or pines mixed woodlands open fields or pastures significant views or vistas historic sites or structures cultural sites or features and centrally or strategically located open spaces wellsuited for a green or park a one and onequarter 1 credit or 125% density bonus shall be awarded for all lands included within this classification sca lands are essentially buildable lands that due to their location in proximity to sensitive water supply sources require protection prohibition of development the purpose of assigning the above referenced density to sca land is for the valid public purpose of protecting environmentally sensitive lands and resources from the negative effects of development 3 restriction on further subdivision all undivided open space and any lot capable of further subdivision shall be restricted from further subdivision permanent conservation easement in a form acceptable to the city and duly recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court of coweta county 4 distribution of designated open space at least 25% of the minimum required open space shall be suitable for active and passive recreation purposes including golf courses and no more than 50% shall be utilized for that purpose in order to preserve a reasonable proportion of natural areas on the site the purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be documented by the applicant general development standards osd2 658 5 general locational standards subdivisions shall be designed around the primary or secondary conservation areas which together constitute the total required open space the design process should therefore commence with the delineation of all potential open space after which potential house sites are located following that access road alignments are identified with lot lines being drawn in as the final step this process hereinafter defined as the fourstep design process is further described below primary or secondary conservation areas shall be placed in undivided preserves which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of the development undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within an open space development to achieve this the majority of house lots should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access safe and convenient pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided except in the case of resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human disturbance where the undivided open space is designated as separate noncontiguous parcels no parcel shall consist of less than 20000 square feet in area nor have a lengthtowidth ratio in excess of  except such areas that are specifically designed as village greens ballfields upland buffers to wetlands waterbodies or watercourses or designed as trail links 6 interconnected open space network as these policies are implemented the protected open space in each new subdivision is envisioned to eventually adjoin each other ultimately forming an interconnected network of primary and secondary conservation areas across the city to assure that there will be no taking of land without compensation the only elements of this network that would necessarily be open to the public are those lands that have been required to be dedicated for public use typically configured in a linear fashion as an element of the citys longrange open space network as an incentive to applicants to connect open space in a proposed development to similarly designated open space in an adjacent existing or proposed development a 2unit density bonus may be awarded for each external linkage provided that the applicant indicate on the sketch plan where the linkage will occur d open space evaluation criteria in evaluating the layout of lots and open space the following criteria will be considered by the planning commission as indicating a design appropriate to the sites natural historic and cultural features and meeting the purposes of this originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between general development standards osd2 659 development and conservation areas accordingly the planning commission shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed sketch plan accomplishes the following 1 required criteria applicants must meet all six required criteria below protects and preserves all floodplains wetlands watershed undisturbed buffers and building setbacks as applicable areas of poor or rocky soils and steep slopes from clearing grading filling or construction except as may be approved by the city for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural native species vegetation of at least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters including creeks streams springs lakes and ponds protects wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered threatened or of special concern by the us environmental protection agency provides active recreational areas in suitable locations offering convenient access by residents and adequately screened from nearby house lots mandatory for developments larger than 10 acres includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system all roadside sidewalks footpaths or multiuse paths should connect with offroad trails which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels or with existing space on adjoining developed parcels where applicable provides open space that is reasonably contiguous and whose configuration is in accordance with the guidelines contained in the design and management handbook for preservation areas produced by the natural lands trust for example fragmentation of open space shall be minimized so that these resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development unless no significant natural features were extant to begin with to the greatest extent practicable this land shall be designed as a single block with logical straightforward boundaries long thin strips of conservation land shall be avoided unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails the open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels and shall be designed as part of larger contiguous and integrated greenway systems 2 recommended criteria general development standards osd2 660 applicants must meet at least four of eight recommended criteria below for each of the recommended criteria met over the four minimum an additional 2% per b3 will be granted preserves and maintains mature woodlands existing fields pastures meadows and orchards and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses for example locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended with two exceptions the first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands which raise an equal or greater preservation concern the second involves predominantly agricultural areas where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat if development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils or in locations at the far or distant edge of a field or foreground meadow as seen from existing public roads homes should face such a field not back into it so that the view from a public road is not of the rear of the home other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads such as by a planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees shrubs and wildflowers designs around existing hedgerows and tree lines between fields or meadows minimizes impacts on large woodlands greater than five acres especially those containing many mature trees or a significant wildlife habitat or those not degraded by invasive vines also woodlands of any size on highly erodible soils with slopes greater than 10% should not be disturbed however woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development stands of hardwoods and mature longleaf pine trees should be preserved while slash or loblolly pines should be considered worthy of preservation only where the site is devoid of other significant tree stands when any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas for buildings roads yards etc in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas to the fullest extent that is practicable leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted particularly as seen from public roadways for example in open agricultural landscapes a deep nobuild nocut buffer is recommended along the public roadway where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant in wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained a deep nobuild nocut buffer should be respected to preserve existing vegetation avoids siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topographic features specific development standards osd2 661 designs around and preserves sites of historic archaeological or cultural value and their environs insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature including stone walls historic homes or buildings historic districts spring

existing public roads establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of roads and streets with historic buildings stone walls hedgerows etc landscaped common areas such as community greens culdesac islands and both sides of new streets with native species shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value e dimensional requirements the dimensional requirements provided in table 6d relating to lot area lot width required yards bulk building height and minimum standards relating to landscaping and open space shall be met before any permits will be issued when these requirements conflict with other requirements above the more restrictive shall apply specific development standards osd2 1 osd2 urban open space design district the urban open space design option is intended to cluster residences in a small grouping or several small groupings similar to neighborhoods that have historically been a part of southeastern small town life such clustered development is intended to soften dense development by providing significant common open space and parklands such clustered development is intended to permit the compact grouping of homes located so as to blend with the existing landscapesuch as the rise and fall of the topography beelines and wooded areasand to preserve to a greater extent the agricultural forest and visual character of the landscape specific standards for this open space development option are as follows sidewalks shall be provided according to the sidewalk requirements the city of newnan ordinances and are required for all osd2 developments no fewer than 10 nor more than 50 lots may be grouped together in a specific cluster clusters may be no closer than 100 feet from each other measured lot line to lot line except that the maximum distance between building areas of cluster lots facing across a green or square is 350 feet a minimum 5foot wide and maximum 8foot wide tree lawn is required between the required sidewalk and the curb the tree lawn shall be planted general site planning standards and procedures osd2 662 with shade trees and additionally landscaped in a manner consistent with the landscaping standards as specified in the tree preservation and landscaping the city ordinances dwellings erected in an osd2 development shall have either a full or partial minimum 33% of facade front porch garages shall be rear entry or rear yardfront entry or may be detached and located in the rear yard alleys are permitted and encouraged to serve garages in the rear of the lots dwellings guest houses garages and other such structures shall not trespass into minimum side yards however detached garages located at the rear of a lot ie behind the rear building line and attached to a similar garage on a contiguous lot may be located within the side yard setback provided that a fire wall separate the individual garage spaces a landscaped green or square is required for any osd2 development of greater than 7 dwellings this green or square may be included in secondary open space calculations greens or squares shall meet the following minimum criteria 1 the maximum lengthwidth ratio of such a green shall be  2 greens or squares shall have a minimum size of 10000 square feet and are recommended to be between 7500 and 40000 square feet in area 3 the use of multiple greens andor squares is encouraged a standard of one green or square per 25 to 30 residences is recommended advisory design standards the city of newnan recognizes that every osd2 design will be a custom response to the unique assets and constraints of each tract as a consequence the city has only incorporated within the osd regulations those siting and design rules required to preserve open space allow the clustering of dwellings and create a neighborhood atmosphere however the city does wish to encourage design consistent with the city of newnans past and appends the following general design guidelines

on usda soil conservation service mediumintensity maps  and the location of significant features such as woodlands tree lines open fields or meadows scenic views into or out from the property watershed divides and drainage ways fences or stone walls rock outcrops and existing structures roads tracks and trails the existing site features plans shall identify primary conservation areas and secondary conservation areas as described above together these conservation areas comprise the developments proposed open space the location of which shall be consistent with the locational design criteria listed in the comprehensive plan the existing site features plan shall form the basis for the sketch plan which shall show the tentative location of houses streets lot lines and greenway lands in new subdivisions according to the fourstep design process described in b6 3 onsite field survey after the existing site features plan has been prepared the development review committee drc shall schedule a mutually convenient date to walk the property with the applicant and hisher site designer the purpose of this visit is to familiarize city officials with the propertys special features and to provide them an informal opportunity to offer guidance or at least a response to the applicant regarding the tentative location of the secondary conservation areas and potential house locations and street alignments if this visit is not scheduled before submittal of the sketch or the sketch plan it should occur soon thereafter 4 presubmittal conference prior to the submittal of the sketch plan the applicant shall meet with the development review committee drc to discuss how the fourstep approach to designing subdivisions described in b6 could be applied to the subject property at the discretion of the drc this conference may be combined with the onsite field survey 5 sketch plan general requirements as used in this the term sketch plan refers to a preliminarily engineered plan drawn to illustrate initial thoughts about a conceptual layout for greenway lands house sites and street alignments this is the stage where drawings are tentatively illustrated prior to any significant expenditure on engineering costs in the detailed design of streets stormwater management systems or the accurate delineation of internal lot boundaries general site planning standards and procedures osd2 666 after the presubmittal conference a sketch plan on a 24 x 36 plat shall be submitted by the applicant to the planning department who will then submit it to the development review committee drc for review for the purpose of securing early agreement on the overall pattern of streets house lots primary and secondary conservation areas and potential trail linkages where applicable it is highly recommended that the sketch plan be prepared by either an asla certified landscape architect a physical or site planner experienced in designing open space subdivisions or a design team that includes such professionals 6 sketch plan fourstep process each sketch plan shall follow a fourstep design process as described below when the sketch plan is submitted applicants shall be prepared to demonstrate to the planning commission that these four design steps were followed by their site designers in determining the layout of their proposed streets house lots and greenway lands this process shall be accomplished during the 15 days of the designated 45day review period for preliminary plans designating the open space during the first step all potential conservation areas primary are identified using the existing site features plan guidance on which parts of the remaining land to classify as secondary conservation areas shall be based upon 1 the procedures described in designing open space subdivisions produced by the natural lands trust 2 onsite visits or field surveys 3 the open space locational criteria contained above 4 the evaluation criteria listed in above 5 information from published data and reports and 6 conversations with existing or recent owners of the property members of the planning commission and the development review committee drc location of house sites during the second step potential house sites are tentatively located 1 because the proposed location of houses within each lot represents a significant decision with potential impacts on the ability of the development to meet the 14 evaluation criteria contained above subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the sketch plan and proposed house sites on the detailed final plan 2 house sites should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from primary conservation areas but may be situated within 50 feet of general site planning standards and procedures osd2 667 secondary conservation areas in order to enjoy views of the latter without negatively impacting the former 3 the building footprint of proposed residences may be changed by more than 50 feet in any direction with majority approval from the members of the planning commission changes involving less than 50 feet do not require approval street and lot layout the third step consists of aligning proposed streets to provide vehicular access to each house in the most reasonable and efficient manner 1 when lots and access streets are laid out they shall be located in a way that avoids or at least minimizes adverse impacts on both the primary and secondary conservation areas 2 to the greatest extent practicable wetland or stream crossings and streets traversing existing slopes over 15% are strongly discouraged 3 street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize the number of new culdesacs to be maintained by the city and to facilitate easy access to and from homes in different parts of the property and on adjoining parcels where culdesacs are necessary those serving 6 or fewer homes may be designed with hammerheads facilitating threepoint turns culdesacs serving more than 6 homes shall generally be designed with a central island containing indigenous trees and shrubs either conserved on site or planted the city generally encourages the creation of singleloaded residential access streets in order that the maximum number of homes in new developments may enjoy views of open space please note that the method of subdivision layout required in this from conventional subdivision layout in that street position is only considered when open space and home site have been determined lot lines the fourth step is simply to draw in the lot lines where applicable 7 engineering certification prior to approval of the sketch plan the applicant shall submit to the drc a preliminary engineering certification that the approximate layout of proposed streets houselots and open space lands complies with the citys zoning and subdivision ordinances particularly those sections governing the design of subdivision streets and stormwater

most commonly a wall delineates a building and supports its superstructure separates space in buildings w 1348 into rooms or protects or delineates a space in the open air there are three principal types of structural walls building walls exterior boundary walls and retaining walls building walls have two main purposes to support roofs and ceilings and to divide space providing security against intrusion and weather boundary walls include privacy walls boundarymarking walls and city walls the conventional differentiation between a boundary wall and a fence is that a fence is of minimal thickness and often is open in nature while a wall is usually more than a nominal thickness and is completely closed or opaque more to the point if an exterior structure is made of wood or wire it is generally referred to as a fence while if it is made of masonry it is considered a wall retaining walls are a special type of wall that may be either external to a building or part of a building that serves to provide a barrier to the movement of earth stone or water the ground surface or water on one side of a retaining wall will be noticeably higher than on the other side warehouse a building

scale and height h architectural and site elements respect the prevailing character when designing new development a new construction b new additions to historic buildings ________________________________________________________ guidelines for new construction purpose and intent new construction should be designed to be compatible with its surroundings by borrowing design characteristics and materials from adjacent buildings and integrating not copying these into a modern expression the underlying guideline for new construction and additions is to consider ones neighbors and nearby structures and to reinforce the existing character compatible design the quality and excellence in design should be major determinants in deciding appropriate new construction the following aspects of new construction shall be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which the new construction is visually related the height the gross volume the proportion between width and height of the facades the proportions and relationship between doors and windows the rhythm of solids to voids created by openings in the faade and materials used in the faade the texture inherent in the faade the colors pattern and trip used in the faade and the design of the roof before designing new development take time to evaluate what makes the property and its surrounding area distinctive then decide how the new development can best be designed to complement the property and area the following steps will assist in designing new development compatible with the existing historic district 4 define the area of influence the first step in considering the appropriateness of a design for a new building in a historic district is to determine the area of influence which will be affected by the new development the area of influence will be that area which will be visually influenced by the new building a consistent streetscape will result when new buildings are designed in consideration with what already exists area of influence each site within a historic distinct will have its own unique area of influence shown here are two different examples with suggested minimum areas that might be considered neighboring buildings should be examined to determine the consistent patterns of design concepts and architectural elements that are present 5 a area of influence with historic resources if the area of influence contains historic resources the next step is to determine the prevailing character of the existing development within the area of influence proceed to recognize prevalent character of existing development on  b area of influence without historic resources if the area of influence does not contain historic resources the new construction should be in keeping with the district as a whole and follow these guidelines standards a new construction should enhance the overall character of the historic district and contribute to the districts ongoing evolution b new construction should be compatible with the dominant design characteristics of historic buildings with similar uses ie residential commercial industrial within the district design characteristics to be considered include building orientation and setback scale directional emphasis shape proportion rhythm massing and architectural and site elements 6 recognize prevalent character of existing development every building whether historic or modern is a product of design and the design of buildings is determined by the way in which basic design concepts are utilized these design concepts include building orientation and setback directional emphasis shape rhythm proportion massing scaleheight architectural and site elements when a new structure is built among historic buildings the level of success with which it relates to existing buildingsand whether it contributes or detracts from the areawill be determined by the ways in which its design recognizes the prevailing design expression in the area of influence standards a identify and respect the prevailing character of adjacent historic buildings and surrounding development following are definitions for the basic design concepts listed above and guidelines for evaluating these concepts in proposed new buildings or additions line drawings illustrate the design concepts for both commercial and residential buildings 7 a building orientation and setback building orientation refers to the directional placement of the building on the site while setback refers to how far back the building is from the street and side lot lines typically historic areas have strong predominant orientations and setbacks standards a the orientation of a new building and its site placement should be consistent with dominant patterns within the area of influence +building orientationsetbackthe proposed commercial building in this illustration respects prevailing orientation and setback patterns of this commercial row building setbackthe proposed commercial building is in violation of the established setback of the street building orientationthe proposed commercial building in this illustration is inconsistent with the established frontfaade orientation pattern of the adjacent commercial buildings   8 b directional emphasis most buildings are either vertical or horizontal in their directional emphasis this is determined by a buildings overall shape as well as by the size and placement of elements and openings on the buildings front facade directional emphasis may also be influenced by surface materials and architectural detailing standards a a new buildings directional emphasis should be consistent with dominant patterns of directional emphasis within the area of influence   +directional emphasisthese commercial buildings exhibit horizontal directional emphasis directional emphasisthese historic commercial buildings left each have vertical directional emphasis but the proposed building right is clearly horizontal in emphasis this new building is neither sympathetic nor consistent with the established pattern of directional emphasis along this commercial street 9 c shape a buildings surfaces and edges define its overall shape the overall shape in concert with the shapes of individual elementsroof pitch window and door openings and porch form if a porch existsis important in establishing rhythms in a streetscape shape can also be an important element of style standards roof pitch a the roof pitch of a new building should be consistent with those of existing buildings within the area of influence shape  roof pitch  the gabled +shape  roof pitch  many institutroof of the new building is in ional and some commercial buildings appropriate in this row of flatroofed have hipped or gabled roofs if historic commercial buildings pitched roof on new construction would be appropriate 10 standards  building elements a the principal elements

and door openings the new building in this of the new building are incompatible example has window and in shape with the elements of the door openings compatible surrounding historic commercial buildings with those in its area of influence 11 d proportion proportion is the relationship of one dimension to another  for example the relationship of the height to the width of a building or the height and width of windows and doors individual elements of a building should be proportional to each other and the building standards a the proportions of a new building should be consistent with dominant patterns of proportion of existing buildings in the area of influence proportion  the frontfaade height +proportion  the frontfaade heightto width ratio of the proposed commercial towidth ratio of this commercial building resulting in a very horizontal example has a vertical expression expression is incompatible with the vertical compatible with surrounding buildings expression of existing buildings commercial proportions the above graphic illustrates the concept of proportion using commercial building dimensions 12 e rhythm standards a new construction in a historic area should respect and not disrupt existing rhythmic patterns in the area of influence rhythm  this row of commercial buildings illustrates the rhythm created by storefronts and upperstory windows  rhythm  established setback these two rows of commercial buildings along a street have an established setback the proposed building disrupts the rhythm of the setback along the street 13 f massing massing has to do with the way in which a buildings volumetric components ie main body roof bays overhangs and porches are arranged and with the relationship between solid wall surfaces and openings standards a the massing of a new building should be consistent with dominant massing patterns of existing buildings in the area of influence if such patterns are apparent g scale and height scale refers to the apparent relationship between two entities such as the relationship of a buildings height to human height the relationship between different buildings heights and sizes or the relationship between the size of an addition and the building to which it is attached in a historic district the two most important issues are 1 the relationship of the scale of new construction to historic and 2 the relationship of the scale of additions to the historic building to which they are being added standards a a proposed new building should conform to the floortofloor heights of existing structures if there is a dominant pattern within the area of influence b new construction in historic areas should be consistent with dominant patterns of scale within the area of influence c additions to historic buildings should not overwhelm the existing building scaleheight  the scale of the proposed commercial building is incompatible with other buildings in the area of influence the floortofloor height and building elements are much larger scale than those of the surrounding buildings 14       scaleheight  this addition is too large and overwhelms the existing commercial building 15 h architectural and site elements predominant architectural and site elements in the area of influence should also be taken into account when designing new construction the following elements should be considered roofs  the majority of commercial building roofs are flat or only slightly pitched and hidden by parapet walls industrial buildings may have more steeply pitched roofs and very distinctive parapet walls some commercial buildings and many institutional buildings have hipped or gabled roofs as a predominant characteristic walls  the surfaces of commercial building walls are generally relatively smooth and uninterrupted with the exception of building and storefront cornices and sometimes awnings institutional building walls may be broken by projecting architectural elements windows and entrances  firstfloor storefront entrances are distinctive to commercial buildings and are important architectural elements other patterns of window and door openings including placement size or ornamentation may provide strong visual components in a commercial area details  building and storefront cornices parapet walls masonry or cast iron storefront piers and other decorative details can provide a pattern and scale to historic commercial buildings materials  commercial buildings may incorporate brick or stone masonry stucco cast iron pressed metal wood and other historically compatible materials these materials have different textures and shapes which give variety to the appearance of a commercial building the application of any exterior finish material such as an exterior insulating finishing system to historic exterior materials is strongly discouraged landscape elements  specific types of vegetation such as live oak trees shrubs or expanses of grassy lawn may predominate in a residential area architectural elements such as fences walls garden architecture outbuildings or flower beds may also contribute to visual continuity along the street street trees sidewalks and curbs are generally the dominant landscape elements in a commercial area larger green spaces with trees shrubs and 16 lawn areas may be found around institutional buildings these elements contribute to visual continuity along a commercial street parking  parking to the rear of buildings rather than to the front of buildings is encouraged wherever possible this will also help avoid setbacks that are out of character with the historic pattern and to preserve greenspace standards a new construction should reference and not conflict with the predominant site and architectural elements of existing properties in the area of influence 17 respect the prevailing character when designing new development after identifying the area of influence and assessing the prevailing character of the existing development within that area the next step is to begin the design of the project each project is unique and needs to be taken on a casebycase basis to meet the needs of the owner while at the same time protecting the historic character of the property and area following are some general concepts that can assist with the design of new development use these concepts along with those found in recognize prevalent character of existing development a new construction to be compatible with its historic environment new construction should respect established design patterns within the area of influence standards a build a new structure to the rear of a historic building where it will have little or no impact on the streetscape b if the new building will be visible from the street respect the established setbacks and orientations of the historic buildings c landscaping associated with a new structure should be compatible with that of the surrounding area d new construction should reference predominant design characteristics that make an area distinctive in order to achieve creative and compatible design solutions that are more than mere imitations of existing buildings 18 b new additions to historic buildings property owners considering making an addition to a historic building should ask themselves three questions  does the proposed addition preserve the significant historic materials and features  does the proposed addition preserve the historic character of the building and the surrounding historic district  does the proposed addition protect the historical significance of the building by making a visual distinction between old and new standards a additions to historic buildings should not be placed on the main historic facade or facades of the building locate the proposed addition away from the principal public view ideally to the rear of the building b respect the proportions of the building to which an addition is being added so that the addition does not dominate its historic environment c do not obscure characterdefining features of a historic building with an addition d set an additional story well back from the roof edge to ensure that the historic buildings proportions and profile are not radically changed e additions should respect the character and integrity of original buildings and incorporate design motifs that relate it to the historic building they should always be of quality workmanship and materials f an addition should be designed so that at a later date it could be removed without compromising the character of the historic building g while the addition should be compatible it is acceptable and appropriate for the addition to be clearly discernible as an addition rather than appearing to be an original part of the building consider providing some differentiation in material color andor detailing and setting additions back from the historic buildings wall plane 19

additions to historic commercial buildings ______________________________________________________________________ commercial and industrial rehabilitation standards purpose and intent following are rehabilitation standards specific to newnans commercial and industrial buildings these standards provide guidance to property owners in making sound decisions when planning and carrying out a rehabilitation project as well as providing technical information regarding historic materials and appropriate rehabilitation methods the standards are illustrated by specific examples from newnan each example has a caption that explains what is appropriate or not appropriate appropriate examples are accompanied by a + inappropriate examples are accompanied by an  20 storefronts the elements and arrangement of the firstfloor storefront space identifies a building as a commercial enterprise open to the public a storefront consists of specific elements such as large glass windows for displaying merchandise and an entrance that may be recessed to provide a covered entry for the customer transom windows are often placed across the top of the display windows to allow more light into the interior retail space a storefront cornice tops the storefront and divides it from the upper facade storefronts typically are the location of the majority of alterations and modernizations made to commercial buildings particularly during the 1960s and 1970s the replacement of older wood storefronts with contemporary aluminumframe elements was popular the storefronts of the 1940s and 1950s that were given a more modern and streamlined look with materials such as carrara glass metal frames and glass block are now or will soon be historic standards a retain original elements and their arrangement when rehabilitating an intact storefront b if the original storefront has been partially or completely removed reconstruction of the storefront should be based on historical pictorial or physical documentation c if no documentation or evidence of the original storefront can be found the new storefront design should have elements compatible with the size scale materials and arrangement of similar historic storefronts d historic storefront additions that have become significant should be preserved e historic storefronts should not be covered with materials that hide characterdefining elements and their arrangement  the removal of these nonhistoric materials is encouraged 21 +the storefronts in this building retain their original arrangements including castiron columns display

25 upper floor space the upper floors of commercial buildings typically contain private spaces such as offices storage areas and sometimes residential living space rows of windows distinguish this upperfloor use from the firstfloor public storefront space the upper part of a commercial buildings facade is often the location of stylistic details such as decorative window hoods pilasters and cornices upper facades like storefronts often fall victim to modernization and the loss of their distinctive features and materials standards a upper floors should not be covered with materials that obscure the facades characterdefining elements and their arrangement b removal of nonhistoric materials covering original or historic upper facades is encouraged c upperfloor window openings should not be infilled with any nonhistoric permanent materials d decorative features and stylistic details of upper facades should be retained +this intact upper facade retains its decorative cornice window

this historically brick upper facade and its details have been inappropriately covered with stucco this upper facade has been completely covered with inappropriate materials 27 architectural details architectural details are usually focused on a commercial buildings primary facade these details include decorative window hoods and arches pilasters cornices brickwork parapet walls entrance surrounds and other features that show the influence of design and architectural style these features help define the distinctive character of each commercial building and reflect the various periods of construction during which a commercial area developed standards a retain original architectural details on commercial buildings and keep them wellmaintained b removal of original details or application of details inappropriate to the period or style of a building is discouraged c repair rather than replace damaged elements whenever possible  repair of damaged features should retain as much original material as possible d all replacement features should be of compatible design to the original and documented by historical evidence +the brick corbelling on this upper facade is a distinctive detail that should be retained 28 +this very decorative cornice is a significant characterdefining feature of the 1895 murray warehouse block +the decorative grilles brick detailing and pressed metal cornice are important details on this commercial building +the distinctive transom is an important feature of this storefront +the castiron grilles in this bulkhead are significant details of this storefront 29 +wide arched openings and loading docks are distinctive features of industrial buildings that should be retained +stepped parapet walls are also distinctive features of industrial buildings 30 windows windows in historic commercial buildings provide light into upper floors and help define a buildings character and style window openings that have been covered or infilled with a solid material give a blank appearance to a building facade when original windows have been replaced with inappropriate substitutes the character of a building changes standards a historic windows including window sash glass lintels sills frames moldings and all hardware should be retained and repaired maintenance whenever possible b when deteriorated window elements must be replaced new elements should be compatible with the original in terms of materials design and hardware c if it is necessary to replace an entire window the replacement should be sized to the original opening and should duplicate the proportions and configurations of the original window d upperfloor window openings should not be infilled with any nonhistoric permanent materials  restoration of infilled windows to their historic appearance is encouraged +the wood doublehung windows in this buildings second floor remain intact and provide light into the interior +industrial buildings generally have metalsash multipaned windows with one section that opens inward 31 this buildings original windows have been replaced with inappropriate metalframe jalousie windows the windows of this upper facade have been completely covered  historic windows may remain intact behind the plywood windows on side facades are also important features of a commercial building particularly when the side facade is on a prominent corner  these windows have unfortunately been covered 32 exterior materials a variety of exterior materials was historically used on commercial buildings the majority of latenineteenth to midtwentiethcentury commercial buildings were constructed of brick stone masonry construction was less common stucco terra cotta and pressed metal were sometimes used as exterior surface materials brick and stone as well as terra cotta pressed metal and wood were also frequently used for decorative features and as accent materials cast iron wood bronze and carrara glass were often found on storefronts standards a preserve original exterior materials to the greatest extent possible  work on these materials should be done with care b if replacement of historic materials is necessary the new materials should match the old in design color texture and other visual qualities  materials should be replaced in kind whenever possible c avoid cleaning methods that damage original materials such as sandblasting d the application of any exterior finish material such as an exterior insulating finishing system to historic exterior materials is strongly discouraged +brick is the most common exterior material for historic commercial buildings  various colors and sizes of brick dating from different periods can be found in many commercial areas +stucco is sometimes used as an exterior finish material 33 +stone including granite and marble was often used as an exterior finish material for banks +pressed metal was often used for decorative cornices +corrugated metal may be found on industrial buildings 34 +castiron columns are used to support the weight of upper floors +materials such as terra cotta were used for decorative details 35 repointing and masonry repairs the vast majority of commercial buildings in newnan are masonry structurespredominantly brick although brick is one of the most durable historic building materials it is susceptible to damage due to harsh or abrasive cleaning methods and to deterioration from excessive moisture the mortar used to bond the brick together is also very vulnerable to inappropriate repair or maintenance techniques correct and timely maintenance of masonry exteriors is vital to the structural health and architectural integrity of historic masonry buildings standards a avoid cleaning methods that damage historic masonry such as sandblasting or harsh chemical treatments  use the gentlest means possible when cleaning masonry b repointing of masonry joints should be undertaken only if necessary c when repair or replacement of old mortar is needed the new mortar should duplicate the old in strength composition color texture and mortar joint width d a new mortar with a high content of portland cement should not be used in repointing historic masonry joints unless that is the content of the historic mortar  portland cement can create a bond that is stronger than the historic materials and can cause damage to the historic masonry as the mortar expands and contracts with temperature changes e appropriate repointing techniques and tools should be used to avoid damage to historic masonry and masonry joints f unpainted historic masonry should not be painted unless it is severely damaged or deteriorated this brick masonry has been poorly repointed 36 this brick wall has been sandblasted removing the hard outer coating of the bricks  in an effort to stop deterioration the wall has also been painted +the upper portions of this brick masonry appear to be in good condition  however the lower portions have lost mortar and have been poorly repointed 37 awnings awnings were historically used on commercial buildings to provide protection from the weather for both the customer and the storefront itself they continue to be used for this purpose today as well as to provide a visual enhancement for commercial building facades and an appropriate place for signage standards a awnings placed over display windows are encouraged and often are suitable locations for signage  they should be mounted inside the storefront opening b canvas awnings are recommended  metal bubble and shingled awnings are discouraged c the design for a new awning should consider the color shape and height of surrounding awnings as well as the line other awnings create d historic awnings that lend character to a building should be retained and repaired whenever possible +canvas awnings are the most appropriate awnings for historic commercial buildings 38 +some metal awnings are now becoming historic +a canvas skirt may be used to cover a nonhistoric flat metal awning solid permanent awnings that cover the transom and portions of the storefront are not recommended for historic commercial buildings 39 roofs the majority of commercial and industrial buildings have flat or very slightly pitched roofs hidden by masonry parapet walls a commercial buildings roof form is a very important characterdefining feature standards a maintain a buildings original roof form to the greatest extent possible b roof additions that would be visible from the rightofway are discouraged  if an addition is necessary it should be placed away from a buildings prominent facades so as to have minimum visual impact c historic roofing materials such as clay tile or standing seam metal should be repaired rather than replaced  parapet wall copings made of clay tile terra cotta or similar materials should also be retained and repaired whenever possible d if replacement of historic roofing materials is necessary new materials should match as closely as possible the scale texture and coloration of the historic roofing materials +most commercial buildings have flat or slightly pitched roofs hidden by masonry parapet walls  these parapet walls are significant characterdefining features +many industrial buildings have slightly pitched roofs and stepped parapet walls 40 rear entrances and side facades with the majority of attention focused on the front facades of commercial and industrial buildings rear entrances and side facades are often left unkempt and forgotten rear and side entrance access however can be attractive and convenient secondary entry points and advertisement opportunities for a business standards a retain and respect historic entrances on the rear and side facades  keep them wellmaintained and attractive to customers and employees b new entrances on rear and side facades should be in keeping with a buildings architectural style details and materials +side facades particularly on corner buildings should be as wellmaintained as front facades this side facade has unfortunately lost its firstfloor entrances and openings 41 these rear entrances could be made much more attractive and usable if they were properly maintained 42 gutters and downspouts adequate roof drainage is necessary to 1 ensure that roofing materials provide a weathertight covering and 2 prevent water from splashing against walls or draining toward buildings inadequate drainage including missing and rusted gutters and downspouts often leads to moisture damage in masonry walls and deterioration of building features most commercial building gutters are located behind masonry parapet walls and downspouts are located on rear walls toward which the buildings flat or slightly pitched roofs usually drain standards a gutters and downspouts should be maintained in their original appearance and location b inspect existing gutters and downspouts frequently to ensure they are unobstructed and that water is draining away from the building c if gutters and downspouts are deteriorated and need to be replaced new gutters and downspouts should be similar to the original in materials and appearance +this gutter and downspout system is wellmaintained 43 mechanical services mechanical services are a necessary part of occupying a historic commercial building however mechanical equipment should be placed at the rear or side facade of a building or even on a buildings roof rather than at the front facade standards a air conditioners and similar mechanical equipment should be placed so as not to detract from the historical integrity of a building b the primary facades of a building should not be disrupted by the addition of mechanical services +this mechanical equipment is appropriately placed at the rear of these commercial buildings   44 historic additions and alterations additions and alterations may have been made to commercial buildings over the years that are of quality workmanship and illustrate the evolution of commercial design this is especially true of storefronts where new materials and designs may have been introduced onto older commercial buildings to modernize the storefronts for example the addition of carrara glass panels to storefronts was a popular treatment during the 1940s and 1950s these additions and alterations made during the historic period may have become significant in their own right and worthy of preservation standards a historic additions and alterations that have acquired significance in their own right particularly storefront additions should be preserved +this storefront is probably not original to the building but was added at a later date and has gained significance in its own right 45 new additions to historic commercial buildings new additions to historic commercial buildings are not common and are generally made to the rear of a building especially on attached buildings in a commercial row where space for expansion is limited standards a commercial building additions should be placed to the rear of the building and should be compatible with the existing structure b the design of the addition should be clearly differentiated so that the addition is not mistaken for part of the original building c the new addition should be designed so that a minimum of historic materials and characterdefining elements are obscured damaged or destroyed   +these additions have been appropriately placed at the rear of these commercial buildings 46 institutional rehabilitation standards _______________________________________________________ purpose and intent distinctive features alterations and additions adaptive use ____________________________________________________________ institutional rehabilitation standards purpose and intent following are rehabilitation standards for newnans institutional buildings these structures include governmental buildings such as the county courthouse educational buildings such as neighborhood schools and religious buildings such as churches institutional buildings are visually prominent landmarks that provide a unique community identity and appropriate rehabilitation work on these buildings can make a significant impact on preserving the historic character of the district many of the rehabilitation standards in commercial and industrial rehabilitation standards may also be applied to institutional buildings standards for such features as entrances windows exterior materials repointing and masonry repairs roofs and gutters and downspouts are the same for both commercial and institutional buildings institutional buildings however also have their own distinctive rehabilitation issues 47 distinctive features institutional buildings are often the most stylistic buildings in a downtown area and many are architectdesigned their distinctive architectural features are therefore especially important to their design and integrity and every effort should be made to preserve these features standards a retain distinctive features that characterize historic institutional buildings and make them visually prominent landmark buildings b deteriorated features should be repaired rather than replaced c when replacement is required new features should match the old in design color texture and where possible materials d replacement of missing features should be substantiated by documentary physical or pictorial evidence +the classical portico and cupola of the coweta county courthouse 48 +the simplified portico of the municipal building +the pediment and columns of the newnan hospital portico +the distinctive corner entrance of the maggie brown school 49 +the concrete portico of one of the 1950s elementary schools +the distinctive entrance to the high school auditorium +most of the citys religious buildings are constructed of masonry  this brick faade has fine brick detailing 50 this gothic revival style church building has distinctive buttresses many of newnans churches have distinctive towers 51 alterations and additions alterations and additions to institutional buildings are often made to provide more space and accommodate new needs standards a alterations and the placement of additions on institutional buildings should be accomplished without compromising the historic character of these structures b additions should not be placed on the front facade and should have minimal visual impact from the public rightsof way c alteration of an institutional buildings front facade is discouraged + this addition to a historic religious building successfully incorporates details of the historic building without copying it 52 adaptive use historic institutional buildings may successfully accommodate new uses in order to remain an active part of the community many institutional buildings have large spaces that can be easily adapted for a number of compatible uses newnan has several good examples of the adaptive use of historic institutional buildings standards a proposed new uses for institutional buildings should be

minor arterial streets 2 collector streets and 3 local streets the differences in the nature and intensity of development between rural and urban areas require these systems to have characteristics that are somewhat different from the correspondingly named rural classifications a arterials 1 urban principal arterial system serve the major centers of activity of a metropolitan area the highest traffic volume corridors and the longest trip desires  and should carry a high proportion of the total urban area travel on a minimum of mileage the system should be integrated both internally and between major rural connections because of the nature of the travel served by the principal arterial system almost all fully and partially controlled access facilities will be part of this functional system in order to preserve the identification of controlled access facilities the principal arterial system is stratified as follows a interstate principal arterial those routes presently designated by the usdot as part of the interstate system b urban freeway and expressway  limitedaccess urban arterials not on the interstate system c urban principal arterial uncontrolled or partial controlled access 2 urban minor arterial street system the minor arterial street system should interconnect with and augment the urban principal arterial system but provide service at a lower level of mobility than urban principal arterials urban minor arterial street provide service to trips of moderate length within an urban area and this system should distribute travel to geographic areas smaller than those identified with the higher system such facilities may carry local bus routes and provide intracommunity continuity but ideally should not penetrate identifiable neighborhoods this system should include urban connections to rural collector roads where such connections have not been classified as urban principal arterials the spacing of minor arterial streets may vary from 18  12 mile in the central business district to 2  3 miles in the suburban fringes but should normally be not more than 1 mile in fully developed areas b collectors urban collector street system the collector street system provides land access service and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods commercial and industrial areas urban collector street collects traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods and channels it into the arterial system in the central business district and in other areas of like development and traffic density the 34 collector system may include the street grid which forms a logical entity for traffic circulation c local roads urban local street system the local street system comprises all facilities not on one of the higher systems urban local road serves primarily to provide direct access to abutting property and access to the higher order systems it offers the lowest level of mobility and usually contains no bus routes service to traffic movement usually is deliberately discouraged urban local roads constitute the urban public road mileage not classified as part of the principal arterial minor arterial or collector systems inside of urban areas minimum street rightofway street classification sac rightofway feet principal arterial 100 minor arterial 80 principal collector 80 minor collector 60 local residential 50 local residential

20 feet of merging b length each such lane shall be 150 feet in length with an additional tapered transition section 50 feet in length lane pavement width shall be 12 feet where the taper of a new deceleration lane will merge with the taper of an existing driveway or is within twenty 20 feet of merging the deceleration lane shall be extended to that driveway c property lines where a lane or taper would merge with a lane or taper provided for adjoining property or would encroach on the corner radius of a street intersection an altered design may be approved by the city engineer where a 44 lane or taper would extend across an extended property line such lane or taper shall be constructed if there is adequate rightofway in front of the adjoining property d rightofway dedication any additional rightofway necessary for construction of a lane and the abutting curb and gutter and the accommodation of utilities shall be dedicated to the city by the property owner e exceptions the
