where the water purveyor loses jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to the customers water system if a meter is installed at the end of the service connection then the service connection shall mean the downstream end of the meter there should be no unprotected takeoffs from the service line ahead of any meter or backflow prevention device located at the point of

potable water system   water used defined used water means any water supplied by a water purveyor from a public potable water system to a consumers water system after it has passed point of delivery and is no longer under the sanitary control of the water purveyor   water system defined the water system is made up of two parts the utility system and customers system athe utility system consists of the source facilities and the distribution system and includes all those facilities of the water system under the complete control of the utility up to the point where the customers system begins 1the source includes all components of the facilities utilized in the production treatment storage and delivery of water to the distribution system 2the distribution system includes the network of conduits used for the delivery of water from the source to the customers system bthe customers system shall include those parts of the facilities beyond the termination of the utility distribution system which are utilized in conveying utilitydelivered domestic water to points of use   policies the following policies shall apply to all water service connections in the city ano water service connection to any premises shall be installed or maintained by the water purveyor unless the water supply is protected as required by state laws and regulations and this chapter service of water to any premises shall be discontinued by the water purveyor if a backflow prevention device required by this chapter is not installed tested and maintained or if it is found that a backflow prevention device has been removed bypassed or if an unprotected crossconnection exists on the premises service will not be restored until such conditions or defects are corrected bthe customers system should be open for inspection at all reasonable times to authorized representatives of the division to determine whether crossconnections or other structural or sanitary hazards including violations of these regulations exist when such a condition becomes known the supervisor shall deny or immediately discontinue service to the premises by providing for a physical break in the service line until the customer has corrected the conditions in conformance with state and city statutes relating to plumbing and water supplies and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto can approved backflow prevention device shall also be installed on each service line to a customers water system at or near the property line or immediately inside the building being served  but in all cases before the first branch line leading off the service line wherever the following conditions exist 1in the case of premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source by the supervisor the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard 2in the case of premises on which any industrial fluids or any other objectionable substance is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system the public system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line appropriate to the degree of hazard this shall include the handling of process waters and waters originating from the utility system which have been subject to deterioration in quality 3in the case of premises having a internal crossconnections that cannot be permanently corrected and controlled or b intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where entry to all portions of the premises is not readily accessible for inspection purposes making it impracticable or impossible to ascertain whether or not dangerous crossconnections exist the public water system shall be protected against backflow from the premises by installing a backflow prevention device in the service line dthe type of protective device required under subsections c1 2 and 3 of this section shall depend upon the degree of hazard which exists as follows 1in the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply as stated in subsection c1 of this section and it is not subject to any of the following rules the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap separation a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device may be used if the device is approved by the state department of health services and the city water division 2in the case of any premises where there is water or substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health if introduced into the public water system the public water system shall be protected by an approved double check valve assembly 3in the case of any premises where there is any material danger to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device examples of premises where these conditions will exist include sewage treatment plants sewage pumping stations chemical manufacturing plants hospitals mortuaries and plating plants 4in the case of any premises where there are uncontrolled crossconnections either actual or potential the public water system shall be protected by an approved airgap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device at the service connection 5in the case of any premises where because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions it is impossible or impractical to make a complete
