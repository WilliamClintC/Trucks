the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the

containing the required points must have no vegetation removed except as otherwise allowed by this   iv any plot containing the required points may have vegetation removed down to the minimum points required or as otherwise allowed by is   v where conditions permit no more than 50% of the points on any 25foot by 50foot rectangular area may consist of trees greater than 12 inches in diameter for

inches in diameter at four and one half 4  feet above ground level for each 25foot by 50foot rectangle area if five saplings do not exist no woody stems less than two 2 inches in diameter can be removed until 5 saplings have been recruited into the plot notwithstanding the above provisions no more than 40% of the total volume of trees four 4 inches or more in diameter measured at 4 12 feet above ground level may be removed in any ten 10 year period  25  c in order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat existing vegetation under three 3 feet in height and other ground cover including leaf litter and the forest duff layer shall not be cut covered or removed except to provide for a footpath or other permitted uses as described in m paragraphs 2 and 2a above d pruning of tree branches on the bottom 13 of the tree is allowed e in order to maintain a buffer strip of vegetation when the removal of stormdamaged diseased unsafe or dead trees results in the creation of

structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to c1 above as determined by the nonconforming floor of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with c2 above any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the
