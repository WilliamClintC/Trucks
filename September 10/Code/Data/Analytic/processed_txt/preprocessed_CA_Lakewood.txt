exclusion this part shall not apply to the hauling removal or disposal at a legal point of disposal of grass cuttings prunings manure or other trash as a result of gardening or horticulture 5321 refuse findings the city council finds that an exclusive municipal system for the collection of all refuse is necessary for the preservation of the public health safety and welfare  that the periodic collection of refuse from all places in the city benefits all occupants of places and premises in the city  that inasmuch as charges are to be assessed for the collection of refuse it is necessary that said charges be assessed to the occupants of all premises where refuse is produced or generated regardless of whether the occupant places such refuse for collection in a manner prescribed in this part or not and regardless of whether the occupant has any refuse for collection to the end that all persons will place refuse generated or produced on the premises that they occupy for collection in the manner prescribed in this chapter and to the end that the accumulation or scattering of refuse is detrimental to the public health safety and welfare and the cost of removal thereof should be shared by all persons same the city council further finds as follows a that while there is some variation in the amount of refuse produced at a single family residential location or a multiple family residential location such deviation does not justify the expense of measuring the quantities at such residential locations because the expense of measuring quantities at such residential locations would be greater than the extra cost of hauling additional quantities of refuse from a few residential locations in the city b the amount of refuse produced at places of business varies greatly the most equitable method of charging for collecting refuse at these locations is based on the amount of refuse produced or generated the related basis of size and number of containers required for the collection of refuse and upon differing schedules and regularity of collection 5322 exclusive right of collection the city council finds and determines that a governmental function of the city shall be to provide refuse collection to all places and premises within the city it shall be the duty and responsibility of each occupant or person in charge of any place or premise within the city to provide for refuse disposal in accordance with the terms and provisions of this disposal shall mean placing all refuse within the time and manner required by this containers or bins as herein required for disposal by the city or its contractor refuse so placed for disposal shall become the property of the city or its contractor and no person other than the city or its contractor shall remove any refuse so placed for disposal nothing herein contained however shall prevent the owner or occupier of any place or premise from selling recyclable materials as defined in the california integrated

to sanitary sewer and industrial waste ordinance the county of los angeles amendments to the sanitary sewer and industrial waste fees are hereby adopted by reference revised 2009 chapter3 sewer reconstruction fund partl scope added by  7300 title this be known as the sewer reconstruction fund may be cited as such and may hereinafter be referred to as this ordinance or this  7301 purpose most of the existing sewers in the city of lakewood were constructed many years ago and were designed to serve primarily single family residential and other properties at a time when the city of lakewood was of low population and density because of the erection of many new housing units include multiple family units and the growth of commercial and industrial establishments the population density of the city of lakewood is greatly increased with the result that the city sewerage system is no longer adequate in all parts of the city to accomplish the increased volume of sewage generated by such development detailed studies and findings of this fact are contained in a sanitary sewer system study prepared by the city engineer on file in the office of the director of public works the purpose of this to establish a charge to be collected from the owners of such property proposing to discharge to the public sewer quantities of sewage in excess of the quantity for which the existing sewerage system was designed  and to establish a fund into which these charges may be deposited and from which money will be available for the citys sewer reconstruction program 7302 sewer reconstruction program the sewer reconstruction program shall be carried out basically in accordance with the city of lakewoods sewer reconstruction plan contained in the report of the city engineer entitled sanitary sewer system study as updated  and on file in the office of the director of public works if compliance with the reconstruction plan is impossible or impractical because of peculiar or unforeseen conditions and the purposes of this be accomplished and the public health and safety assured by alternate construction the city council may from time to time grant exceptions to the reconstruction plan by motion permitting such alternate construction in addition the city engineer shall periodically review the sewer reconstruction plan and report to the city council any proposed changes in said plan which may hereafter be adopted and approved by the city council by motion 7303 public sewer public sewer or city sewerage system or city sewers as used in this shall mean a

peak flow discharge for single family residential property all single family residential property shall be classified at 600 gallons per day per dwelling unit provided however any single family classification having in addition to a single family use on each 5000 square feet of lot area an accessory use discharging sewage to the public sewer shall be classified for the purpose of this a multiple dwelling the peak flow to the sanitary sewer for a building containing mixed occupancies shall be determined by adding the peak flow characteristics of the various occupancies as set forth in the above table 7331 charges the aforementioned table of peak flows is based upon the sanitary system study prepared by the city engineer using engineering criteria and mathematical formulae in determining the existing sewer capacity needed sewer reconstruction by discharge over and above existing sewer capacity and the cost and scheduling thereof as the result of said study the city council hereby finds and determines that the total cost of reconstruction as set forth in said sewer plan will be at the rate of 15 cents per gallon per day of additional peak flow in excess of 600 gallons which rate shall be modified periodically to reflect any change of lot area per day shall be used in determining the charge to be imposed for the purpose of this the rate of 15 cents per gallon per day 7332 charges for tributary areas the applicant for a permit to connect any tributary area to a public sewer shall declare all information necessary as determined by the city engineer to comply

variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the regulation are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this regulation would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners the city council hereby finds and determines that a variance should be granted only where the physical characteristics of a parcel or property are so unusual that complying with the requirements of these regulations would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners because of the need to protect this city and its property owners from flooding and therefore granting a variance only in an unusual case the following criteria shall be applied in determining whether a variance from the terms and provisions of this regulation should be granted varian ce hearing board the planning and environment commission of the city of lakewood shall hear all applications for a variance from the terms and provisions of this regulation the application shall be on a form approved by the director of community development and accompanied by a floodplain management regulation variance fee established by the city council the planning and environment commission shall consider the application at a public hearing held on notice in the same time and manner required for public hearings before the planning and environment commission for variances from the terms and provisions of the zoning for variances in passing upon requests for variances the planning and environment commission shall in addition consider the following a variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this regulation for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement the planning and environment commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the planning and environment commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient case  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in 803122  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in 803132 cause fraud or victimization as defined in 803120 of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c the following additional relevant factors 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  6 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  7 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  8 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  9 expected heights velocity duration rate ofrise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 10 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges d any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the director of community development and shall include notification that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the los angeles county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land e in the granting of any variance the planning and environment commission may impose such additional conditions necessary in order to protect the public health safety and welfare 8036 appeals the

and recreational purposes would better serve the parks and recreational needs of the city for the following reasons a the city is near development capacity further there are virtually no remaining vacant parcels large enough to accommodate a subdivision and provide for a park of consequential size b the city has existing parks and recreational areas however in view of further residential growth and the subsequent demand on those parks and recreational areas it is deemed necessary to collect a fee in lieu of land dedication the purpose of such fee shall be for the upgrading and maintenance of those existing parks and recreational lands andor for the purpose of purchasing and developing additional land for park or recreational use when feasible fee required as a condition of approval of a final tract or parcel map the subdivider shall pay a fee for the purpose of upgrading and maintaining existing parks and recreational areas andor for the purpose of purchasing and developing

residing within the city be devoted to park and recreational purposes therefore based upon such standards and where the general plan requires or provides for park and recreational facilities bearing a reasonable relationship to the proposed subdivision fees shall be paid therefore in accordance with the provisions of this the city council finds and determines that the requirements of subsection 1 are satisfied in part by cooperative arrangements between the city and the county or school districts making available 28 acres of property for each one thousand persons residing within the city for park and recreational purposes and that the remainder of the required four acres shall be supplied by the purchase and development of vacant land for park and recreational use when feasible application of this section 3 population density for the purpose of this section shall be determined in accordance with the 1980 census of population on housing which for the city of lakewood is 29

3 that the use of private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of future owners of property within the tract and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city council  and 4 that proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes taking into consideration such factors as size shape topography geology access and location of private open land spaces  5 that facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the recreation element of the general plan and are approved by the advisory agency or city council e where fees are required for the purpose of upgrading existing parks and recreational areas andor for the purpose of purchasing and developing additional land for park and recreational use the same shall be paid to the city upon the final inspection or the date certificate of occupancy

and constructed for one use only and may not be readily transformed into another use and that abandoned  unoccupied service stations create blight  become a place for the dumping and depositing of junk  trash and debris and generally deteriorate surrounding properties  it is the purpose of this prevent those and other harmful effects and to promote the public convenience and welfare  conserve the value ofbuildings and encourage the most appropriate use ofland within the city oflakewood by requiring service station site plan review and control as hereinafter set forth  the city council
