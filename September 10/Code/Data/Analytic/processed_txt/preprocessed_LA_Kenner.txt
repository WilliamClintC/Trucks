devices are clearly designated in accordance with this article  indoor pistol and firing ranges 1 general requirements a any gallery range license applicant within this jurisdiction must show intent to comply with these code requirements before a building permit will be granted and must demonstrate compliance before occupancy in order to receive a license to operate b the range is understood to include the entire space enclosed by the building structure in which the discharge of firearms may take place the space behind the shooters however great is included in the range and must comply c compliance will be determined from the building plans provided for obtaining the building permit and from such additional data as may be requested d in recognition that special considerations are sometimes involved the licensing authority may add further requirements as it sees fit furthermore any of the following requirements may be waived or altered if sufficient reason can be shown e the primary type of shooting activity that will be conducted must be established for the record all other shooting activities that might be conducted must also be established in case of conflict the most severe activity will govern compliance f except as provided in the section for special ranges the range must be of the fixed firing line type in which the shooters remain at one firing line and the targets are brought back and forth to the target lines mechanically g specialized terminology in this code shall be interpreted according to the glossary which follows it all terminology not included in the glossary shall be interpreted according to websters unabridged international dictionary current edition 2 special considerations a the length must be sufficiently great that the shooters will never be closer than thirtyfive 35 feet to the bullet trap  as measured by the longest projection of the bullet trap upon the floor and sufficient for proper door placement as defined later b the width must be sufficient to provide threefoot minimum width shooting points for ranges with shooting separators and fivefoot minimum width points for those without separators there is no maximum width c the height at the firing line must be eightfoot minimum from floor to ceiling the purpose of this requirement is to discourage attempts to build ranges in spaces that cannot be responsibly equipped and supervised there shall be no downrange doors into occupied areas downrange shall be understood to be from a point three 3 feet behind the firing line to the bullet trap if there is more than one 1 firing line the most distant one from the trap governs there may be downrange doors into unoccupied areas if human egress is not possible this provides for electrical and plumbing cabinets etc of course it is prudent that these be protected there may be downrange doors into normally unoccupied areas that permit human egress providing that they are equipped with electrical safety devices that will provide an alarm to the firing line if the area is occupied and that will provide an alarm in the area if any of the ordinary range functions are commenced turning on target lights target systems etc this makes possible the use of storage areas that can only be reached range d windows are governed by the following requirements whether noise attenuating shatterproof or bulletproof is determined by use of the range and is not the purview of this  1 there shall be no windows into contiguous areas not controlled by the owner 2 downrange windows shall be governed as stipulated for downrange doors 3 ballistic security a weapons it must be established for the record what weapons and ammunition will be used handguns shall be of reputable manufacturers and ammunition factory loaded b secure area if the range is situated so that an escaped bullet cannot fall into or pass areas there is no ballistic security requirement for the structure separating the range from such areas the range design manuals of the regular military services shall govern the amount of secure area required in such cases c earth separation earth separation of three 3 feet or greater is sufficient to eliminate any ballistical security requirement of the structure in that particular direction d critical zones critical zones must be penetration proof for the heaviest ammunition that might be used on the range fired point blank into it at ninety 90 degrees to the surface 1 the horizontal critical zone is any surface that a shooter in any shooting point can hit from fortyfive 45 degrees downrange on either side to twenty 20 degrees behind him on either side 2 the vertical critical zone is any surface that a shooter in any shooting point can hit when facing downrange from straight down to straight up 4 wall construction a walls in the critical zone may be standard grade concrete blocks with their cavities filled with crushed rock of threequarterinch or smaller screen sand is not acceptable concrete of any density is acceptable as the fill other suitable constructions are four 4 inches of reinforced concrete onequarter inch of mild steel over an appropriate supporting surface single layer of face brick b walls in the secondary zone may be standard grade concrete blocks without filled cavities other suitable constructions are three 3 inches of reinforced concrete oneeighth inch of mild steel over an appropriate supporting surface wood planking plywood and gypsum board maybe used in sufficient thicknesses to be ballistically equivalent but may result in excessive maintenance c wall baffles may be used in lieu of the above constructions for either zone when used there is no ballistical security requirement of the walls when used the following requirements must be met 1 the baffles must shelter the wall so that misdirected shots from all shooting points are interrupted by the baffles before striking the wall 2 the baffles must be so angled that no bullet may hit any baffle at a greater angle than fortyfive 45 degrees 3 the baffle steel must be of sufficient thickness that it is not dented by the heaviest ammunition if left bare or if covered with a wood surface it must be of sufficient thickness that even if dented its structural integrity is maintained d wall construction in residential areas as nonconforming 1 side walls shall be protected by a oneeighthinch steel plate or lengthening of shooting separators to guard against misaimed projectiles from striking side walls 2 rear wall shall be protected by a oneeighthinch steel plate to guard against fail of venetian or escalator system 5 floor construction a in the critical zone floors shall be reinforced concrete of fourinch minimum thickness in new construction the floor shall be graded to a downrange floor drain b exposed slab ceiling or roof must be governed by the same requirements as floors if the bottom surface of the slab is not smooth the following shall govern c ceiling baffles must be provided to protect any item that may interrupt the downrange travel of bullets from an angle of fortyfive 45 degrees to the vertical ahead of the shooter to the bullet trap if the ceiling baffles protect the entire overhead area each baffle starting its protection where the previous one left off then there is no ballistical security requirement for the ceiling or roof above the baffle construction must otherwise comply with the requirements for wall baffles 6 ceiling system a if the range has a smooth concrete slab ceiling without any beams or protrusions and no ducts conduits etc need be run area then simple redirective coves for the lights may be adequate this is rarely the case in most cases a conventional air space principle safety ceiling system is the best choice b if the owner is doing all of his own work in converting the building to a range he can fabricate his ceiling system less expensively than buying it however more and more facilities are being put in by businessmen who are more concerned about getting into profitable operation with a minimum of nuisance than minor savings in those cases our prefabricated ceiling members are real bargains in a typical situation sixteenfoot long horizontal members will start at the firing line and extend downrange this will be followed by four 4 airspace principle baffles and a final redirective cove just ahead of the trap c columns pilasters exposed piping and other protuberances downrange shall be protected from damage and prevented from causing ricochets angled steel plates may be used for all protuberances the requirements for wall baffles shall govern pilasters may be faired to the wall with concrete so that the angle to the wall of the surface of the fairing concrete is thirty 30 degrees or less 7 plumbing a in new construction there shall be a floor drain downrange and a hose bib in the range area b in existing construction the floor drain may be waived if a slop sink is located within fifty 50 feet of the range c wood facings are not allowed for protection of surface unless they are separated from any hard surface steel or masonry behind them by an air space of at least one 1 inch 8 noise attenuation a the maximum noise that may escape the range into areas not controlled by the owner is 40 db b sufficient acoustical treatment shall be provided to reduce the sound level from magnum ammunition by 10 db minimum c acoustical materials subject to spraying ie the sprayed on type shall not be used 9 ventilation a the permissible exposure to toxic lead products of gunfire shall be governed by current us department of labor standards b there must be positive flow of air past the shooter in a downrange direction with all exhaust downrange c the minimum operating temperature shall be fifty 50 degrees fahrenheit and the maximum ninety 90 degrees fahrenheit 10 lighting a there shall be general illumination in the firing line area of 30 mfc as measured at the floor the minimum downrange general illumination shall be 10 mfc at the floor b at least one 1 circuit must be on dual switches so that it may be turned on from the door c there shall be emergency lighting that will automatically illuminate if the lights fail this must be on standby power 11 bullet traps a locally fabricated plateandpit backstops are the chief cause of equipment induced range accidents modern bullet traps involve complex considerations that are beyond the capability of the authority to evaluate even if believed to be adequate by the local fabricator therefore the bullet trap shall

use that creates a need for additional vehicle parking spaces of ten percent 10% or more the additional spaces are required no additional vehicle parking spaces are required if the greater intensity would result in an increase of spaces of less than ten percent 10% this also applies to a simultaneous increase in intensity of a group of uses on the same lot which together result in a need for an increase in vehicle parking spaces of ten percent 10% or more the ten percent 10% threshold is calculated by dividing the number of additional spaces required due to the increase in intensity divided by those spaces required before the increase d provision of additional vehicle spaces  1 nothing in this the voluntary establishment of additional offstreet vehicle and bicycle parking spaces above

design of additional facilities shall meet the requirements of this 3 where a use exceeds the minimum number of vehicle spaces required by the area used for additional spaces may be constructed of permeable paving e shared parking requirements for mixeduse developments  1 shared parking for mixeduse developments is based on the fact that certain uses operate at different times over a twentyfourhour period with their greatest demand for parking occurring during mutually exclusive times these uses are therefore able to share parking spaces during particular times and under certain conditions the total number of parking spaces otherwise required for individual uses may be reduced 2 for purposes of these requirements shared parking for mixeduse developments refers to two 2 or more land uses occupying the same lot or occupying contiguous lots with parking located on the same lot or contiguous lot upon which the uses sharing the parking are located shared parking refers to the use of the same offstreet parking stall to satisfy the offstreet parking requirements for two 2 or more uses the following conditions shall apply to all shared parking for mixeduse developments 3 shared parking is permitted by agreement only the agreement must a be in writing and executed by all owners of the properties affected  b specify the parking being shared and the hours of operation by the uses involved  c be enforced by the director of inspection and the city attorney  d be recorded in the office of the clerk of court by the owners of the property affected and a copy furnished to the director of inspection and the director of planning and zoning e an affidavit stating that the shared parking agreement is valid and no change in use or hours of operation of the affected properties has occurred shall be submitted annually to the director of inspection and f a violation shall occur if a use is operated at a time other than during the hours of operation specified in the shared parking agreement the director of inspection and code enforcement shall revoke the certificate of use or occupancy for any use operated in violation of a shared parking agreement 4 no variances or exceptions from the parking requirements of this ordinance shall be granted by the board of zoning adjustments f prohibited use of parking spaces  the sale repair or dismantling or servicing of vehicles equipment materials or supplies or the display of goods in offstreet parking areas is prohibited unless otherwise permitted by this ordinance offstreet parking areas associated with residential and commercial developments are not to be used for the permanent storage of fleet vehicles computation of parking and loading requirements this section describes how the number of motor vehicle bicycle and loading spaces are calculated based upon the requirements of this 1 where multiple uses with different parking requirements occupy the same structure or lot the required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces is the sum of the requirements for each use computed separately unless otherwise permitted by this 2 space allocated to any offstreet loading space may not be used to satisfy the requirement for any offstreet vehicle or bicycle parking space or access aisle or portion thereof conversely the area allocated to any offstreet vehicle or bicycle parking space may not be used to satisfy the replacement for any offstreet loading space or portion thereof 3 a fraction of less than onehalf 12 is disregarded and a fraction of onehalf 12 or more is counted as one 1 parking or loading space 4 for uses where patrons or spectators occupy benches pews or open floor areas every eighteen 18 linear inches of benches pews or permanent seating areas or five 5 square feet of open floor area used for seating is counted as one 1 seat for the purpose of determining the required number of spaces or as reflected in the most recent version of the international building

stormwater management requirements a stormwater management measures  1 effective onsite stormwater management is supported by a combination of stormwater bmps as outlined in 1db guided by the following strategies a first create conditions that allow detention and infiltration of stormwater runoff onsite use of pervious paving open vegetated areas green roofs blue roofs and other methods that allow water to permeate back into the ground b next additional stormwater runoff should be detained stored infiltrated andor filtered use of bmps c finally runoff in excess of the first one 1 inch shall exit the site or subsurface drainage 2 infiltration practices shall be utilized to reduce runoff volume increases stabilize subsoils and recharge shallow groundwater 3 best management practices bmp shall be employed to minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff prior to discharge into a separate storm drainage system or water body 4 all stormwater management facilities shall be designed to provide an emergency overflow system and incorporate measures to provide a nonerosive velocity of flow along its length and at any outfall 5 the designed release rate of any stormwater structure shall be modified if any increase in flooding or stream channel erosion would result at a downstream dam highway structure or normal point of restricted stream flow b stormwater best management practices  stormwater best management practices bmp minimize runoff increase infiltration recharge groundwater and improve water quality in order to accomplish the performance standard required by this section stormwater bmps shall be used stormwater bmps shall be designed as described in bayou land rc&ds stormwater bmp guidance tool alternate bmps may be considered but shall be approved as part of the stormwater management plan the following list of stormwater bmps are not prescriptive but provide guidance for establishing a sitespecific stormwater management regime and include but are not limited to 1 bioswales bioswales are vegetated swales planted with native plants or ornamental grasses they transport water allow some to infiltrate and can be designed as a landscape feature bioswales are not grassed but are planted with a variety of wetland plant species that flower fruit and have ornamental qualities 2 circular depressions circular grassed depressions are similar to rain groves but are smaller and contain only grass within the depressions it is preferable to use multiple circular grassed depressions circular grassed depressions should be six 6 inches deep and range in diameter from thirtysix 36 inches to seventytwo 72 inches 3 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands such as wet ponds are commonly used on large development projects such as golf courses shopping centers business parks and industrial sites these wetlands shall be designed as part of an integrated drainage system built around lakes and ponds that may include detention areas retention areas irrigation ponds or lowlying areas that collect and store stormwater 4 detentionretention basins wet retention basins are constructed naturalistic ponds with a permanent or seasonal pool of water also called a wet pool or dead storage aquascape facilities such as artificial lakes are a form of wet pool facility that can incorporate innovative design elements to allow them to function as a stormwater treatment facility in addition to a water feature dry extended detention ed basins are basins whose outlets have been designed to drain from a full condition within thirtysix 36 to fortyeight 48 hours to allow sediment particles and associated pollutants to settle and be removed dry ed basins to not have a permanent pool and are designed to drain completely between storm events the slopes bottom and forebay of dry ed basins should be vegetated 5 disconnected roof tops recycling and irrigation a disconnected rooftop is one where stormwater falling on a building roof is captured and prevented from being added to stormwater runoff from a construction site since the water is relatively clean it can be reused for certain domestic use or recycled irrigation system for evaporative disposal or to feed moisture to landscape beds lawns and tree stands 6 ditch gardens louisiana ditch gardens are a variant of a bioswale that increases water quality these are constructed by designing long thin but shallow depressions that can be planted with louisiana wetland plants that trap sediments infiltrate water and clean water of pollutants 7 flow diffusers flow diffusers consist of several design features that can accept channelized flow and convert it to sheet flow to disengage the erosive power of running water examples of flow diffusers include turf grass panels vegetative meadows shallow stone filtration trenches or basins reinforced with very low earth berms 8 french drains infiltration trenches and dry wells infiltration trenches are excavated into the ground either horizontally or vertically and filled with stone aggregate to capture and allow exfiltration of stormwater runoff into the surrounding soils from the bottom and sides of the trench or well pollutant removal is achieved by filtration of the runoff stone aggregate and soil as well as biological and chemical activity within the soil this is called a french drain in louisiana and can be fitted with an outflow if soil types warrant such treatment 9 grassed swales grassed swales are designed conveyance devices used to transport water over the surface of the ground to a point of disposal that may be a catch basin ditch water body or a stormwater bmp that will filter infiltrate evaporate and clean the water of tss solid waste and other pollutants swales are often appropriate along property lines public streets and around buildings 10 habitat preservation and protection areas habitat protection areas hpa are large tree protection areas in which a complete habitat of plants soils water regimes animal life and nutrients work together to produce clean air pure water rich soils and a population of animal life living and growing off of the biological productivity and diversity 11 permeable pavers porous surfaces grass paving and structural soils porous paving reduces site runoff and allows the infiltration of stormwater structural soils are designed to bear the weight of heavy construction such as parking lots terraces and courtyard but also provide void space for tree roots and stormwater infiltration 12 planted stormwater buffers planted stormwater buffers can absorb stormwater falling on development sites planted buffers can improve internal drainage and be linked for maximum stormwater collection during rainfall events buffers can be built for stormwater management along roadways at property edges parallel to walkways driveways structures and almost any place on a development site in which open space can be found that can be planted 13 preserved forest floors rain falling on the tree canopy is managed as soon as raindrops fall on leaves and continues until the roots uptake the water hours after the storm event this preserves trees and manages stormwater as well as preserves natural habitat and remnant forest stands on development sites 14 preserved wetlands wetlands are characterized as vegetated parcels of land that have standing water for part of the year wetlands are also delineated according to existing vegetation and soil types the army corps of engineers designate a wetland as any low area meeting certain jurisdictional requirements of water soil and vegetation wetlands within cities are often low areas that trap and hold rainfall and release it at very slow rates of water flow 15 rain gardens rain gardens are small shallow depressions planted with a variety of native or ornamental plants that can treat small amounts of runoff to improve water quality rain gardens are generally small collections of water loving plants planted on a low site area that naturally collects rainfall 16 rain groves rain groves are miniature forests that provide multiple services they provide habitat for birds and other fauna that live close to developed areas a rain grove will intercept runoff to provide a suitable habitat to grow a variety of wetland trees and shrubs 17 rooftop runoff management rooftop runoff management captures stormwater variety of techniques including green roofs blue roofs cisterns and rain barrels 18 sand filters sand filters are depressions trenches barriers or sand lens constructed of porous mineral matter that improve groundwater recharge to filter clean and trap waterborne pollutants 19 stream bank or riparian buffers a stream bank buffer is a protected area along a water body such as a stream bayou pond or lake where development is restricted or prohibited they can vary in width from twenty 20 feet to two hundred fifty 250 feet the widths of the buffer zone is dependent upon the size of the stream its drainage load and overflow characteristics although other factors such as slope soils and amount of vegetation are considered 20 tree protection areas tree protection areas tpa are small habitat preservation areas hpa that are set aside as an area around the trunk of a tree to be preserved on a development site the purpose of the tpa is to protect the critical root zone crz of the tree and to prevent damage or interference during construction this area is established in relation to the tree size diameter of the crown diameter of the tree at dbh and location of feeder roots where most of the water and plant nutrients are absorbed 21 cisterns and underground stormwater chambers aboveground stormwater cisterns and underground stormwater chambers are effective longterm stormwater management systems they are primarily used for landscape irrigation with grey water or to temporarily store and release at a predictable rate of stormwater flow general sign regulations purpose and intent the purpose of this to establish a comprehensive system of sign controls governing the display design construction location installation and
