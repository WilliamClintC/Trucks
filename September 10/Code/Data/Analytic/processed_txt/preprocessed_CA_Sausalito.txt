the city of sausalito hereby finds that local conditions have an adverse effect on the prevention of a major loss fires b major earthquake damage and c the potential for life and property loss making necessary changes or modifications to the 2015 international fire california fire the 2016 california building standards order to provide a reasonable degree of property security and fire and life safety in this fire district specifically the city council of the city of sausalito finds the following local conditions make more stringent standards a necessity 1 climatic a precipitation precipitation ranges from 15 to 42 inches per year with an average of approximately 25 inches per year approximately 90 percent falls during the months of november percent from may b relative humidity humidity generally ranges from 50 percent during daytime to 86 percent at night it drops to 20 percent during the summer months and occasionally drops lower c temperatures temperatures have been recorded as high as 104 degrees fahrenheit average summer highs are in the 78degree to 85degree range d winds prevailing winds are from the northwest however winds are experienced from virtually every direction at one time or another velocities are generally in the five to 15mileperhour range gusting to 30 miles per hour particularly during the summer months strong galeforce ocean winds up to 50 miles per hour blow over the city from the golden gate national recreation area throughout the summer months in addition to winter storms e summary these local climatic conditions affect the acceleration intensity and size of fire in the community times of little or no rainfall of low humidity and high temperatures create extremely hazardous conditions particularly as they relate to wood shake and shingle roof fires and conflagrations the winds experienced in this area can have a tremendous impact upon structure fires of buildings in close proximity to one another commonly found in the city of sausalito during wood shake and shingle roof fires or exposure fires winds can carry sparks and burning brands to other structures thus spreading the fire and causing conflagrations in building fires winds can literally force fires back into the building and can create a blowtorch effect in addition to preventing natural ventilation and crossventilation efforts 2 geographic and topographic a geographic factors the fire environment of a community is primarily a combination of two factors the areas physical geographic characteristics and the historic pattern of urbansuburban development these two factors alone and combined create a mixture of environments which ultimately determines the areas fire protection needs the city council finds sausalito is in a unique geographic area built upon a treecovered 980foot slope with an average grade of 22 percent slopes of 60 percent are commonplace the city is waterbound at its base and along its ridgeline is a national park area of highly combustible grass brush and trees mainly eucalyptus lands in the southerly portion of the city were subdivided in 185 and in the central and northerly portions in 1870 the structural buildup occurred between the 1880s and 1920s in many of the residential areas and the citys commercial center the original construction consists of frame structures built with little or no side yard setbacks on small narrow lots typical of that era the domestic water supply is located at the end of the marin municipal water districts distribution system and consists of five levels of gravity systems of varying pressures and capacities sixteen percent of the citys hydrants are rated at less than 500 gallons per minute and therefore are deficient for fire protection b seismic location the relatively young geological processes that have created the san francisco bay area are still active today the city sits between two active earthquake faults san andreas and the haywardcalaveras and numerous potentially active faults approximately 50 percent of the citys land surface is in the hightomoderate seismic hazard zones c size and population the city of sausalito comprises approximately three square miles including a permanent urban population of 7500 transient populations vary with summer months and special events drawing as high as 15000 people to the city within the city of sausalito are two fire stations and a total of 19 fire department personnel the fire department handles diverse responsibilities including wildland urban freeway air water and emergency paramedical d roads and streets most of sausalitos street and pathway systems were laid out in the 1870s limited offstreet parking has been provided  therefore many of the citys streets have less than 20 feet of unobstructed width and turning radius as required by the uniform fire roadways with less than 20 feet of unobstructed paved surface are considered hazardous in terms of fire access and protection e topography the city of sausalito is a conglomeration of bay fill steep hills valleys and ridges the flatter lands are found in the central and southern portions of the district most of the existing urban and suburbanized areas are built on slopes ranging from five percent to 70 percent grades elevations are varied in the city with city hall listed as 10 feet above sea level elevations in the wolfback ridge development are in the area of 980 feet above sea level correspondingly there is much diversity in slope percentages with a large percentage of homes in the 25 percent to 45 percent range and the average slope being 22 percent slope is an important factor in fire spread as a basic rule of thumb the rate of spread will double as the slope percentage doubles all other factors remaining the same f vegetation sausalitos semiarid mediterraneantype climate produces vegetation similar to that of most of marin county with specific growth locale a result of topography and prevailing wind the south facing exposure is primarily rye grass with occasional clumps of bay and oak trees in the more sheltered pockets the north facing slopes are heavily wooded from lower elevations to ridge with oak bay and eucalyptus trees and minor shrubs of the general chaparral class expansion of the residential community into areas of heavier vegetation has resulted in homes existing in close proximity to dense natural foliage often such dwellings are completely surrounded by highly combustible vegetation compounding the fire problem from a conflagration point of view a large percentage of the structures in the city have costly shingle or shake roofs this very flammable material is susceptible to ignition by embers from a wildland fire furthering the spread of fire to adjacent buildings g summary the above listed conditions increase the magnitude exposure accessibility problems and fire hazards presented to the sausalito fire department the protection of life and property from fire is difficult due to limited access problems created by water cliffs steep slopes and the lack of side yard setbacks as well as the combustible structures and their roofs fire following an earthquake has the potential of causing greater loss of life and damage than the earthquake itself a large percentage of dwellings in the city have wood shingle roofs the citys industrial areas are located in the highest seismic risk zones the highest seismic risk zone also contains the largest concentration of hazardous materials hazardous materials could pose the greatest threat to the largest number should a significant seismic event occur the fire departments resources would have to be prioritized to mitigate the greatest threat and may likely be unavailable for smaller singledwelling or structure fires other variables may tend to intensify the situation i the extent of damage to the water system  ii the extent of isolation due to bridge andor freeway overpass collapse  iii the extent of roadway damage andor amount of debris blocking the roadways  iv climatic conditions hot dry weather with high winds  v time of day will influence the amount of traffic on roadways and could intensify the risk to life during normal business hours  vi the availability of timely mutual aid or military assistance  vii the portion of dwellings with wood shingle roof coverings could result in conflagrations conclusion local climatic geographic and topographic conditions impact fire prevention efforts and the frequency spread acceleration intensity and size of fire involving buildings in this community further they impact potential damage to all structures from earthquake and subsequent fire therefore it is found to be reasonably necessary that the international fire california fire the state building standards changed or modified to mitigate the effects of the above conditions furthermore california health and safety 7 requires that the modification or change be expressly marked and identified as to which each finding refers therefore the city of sausalito finds that the following table provides code sections that have been modified pursuant to sausalito which are building standards as defined in health and safety the associated referenced conditions for modification due to local climatic geographical and topographical reasons ca fire number local followed by corresponding climatic geological and topographical condition findings as set forth above 202s 1e 2a 2b 2d 2e 2f 3021 2b 2d 2e 2g 3201 2b 2d 2e 2g 3202 2b 2d 2e 2g 3203 2b 2d 2e 2g 3204 2b 2d 2e 2g

is in excess of the allowable far for commercial uses by the appropriate factor below i office 314  ii retail 191  iii restaurant 312 b add the resulting number to the existing far for the parcel to get the industrialequivalent far the industrialequivalent far shall not exceed the total far allowed for the zone if the existing industrialequivalent far exceeds the total far allowed for the zone no new development is permitted existing uses may not be converted to more intensive uses if they cause the industrialequivalent far to exceed the total far allowed for the zone here are two examples example a an existing office building in the industrial district contains 030 far this would typically allow an additional 010 far to be constructed for permitted uses as only 015 far is permitted for commercial uses the remaining 015 far is multiplied by 314 office factor the resultant 047 far is added to the allowable 015 far to get an industrialequivalent far of 062 which exceeds the permitted 040 far no further development is permitted example b an existing building in the industrial district contains 022 far for retail uses this would typically allow an additional 018 far to be constructed for permitted uses as only a 015 far is permitted for commercial uses the remaining 007 far is multiplied by the 191 retail factor the resultant  far is added to the 015 far to get an industrialequivalent far of  which is less than the maximum 040 far an additional  far may be constructed for permitted uses 5 building height and bulk building height should be compatible with

finds and determines a the county of marin has adopted a comprehensive general plan which is a highly sophisticated approach to resolution of the extraordinary complexities of suburban growth the city has also adopted a comprehensive general plan designed to provide for orderly growth within its boundaries coordinated and cooperative efforts by the county and its cities are required in order to implement the growth objectives of their respective general plans b unregulated capricious development has in the past caused and unless controlled in the future will cause severe and irremediable injury to the city to marin county and their environment in that 1 it has resulted in a severe shortage of housing for citizens of low and moderate income and sorely limited the economic heterogeneity of the population  2 it has wastefully compelled construction of public facilities on a crisis basis  3 it has sorely overtaxed municipal service districts resulting in numerous water and sewerage moratoriums  4 it has occasioned costs to the taxpayers far in excess of tax gains  5 it has engendered public skepticism concerning the ability of local governments to protect marins environment adequately c standard zoning regulations alone cannot provide the delicate types of development review procedures which will ensure a high level of environmental protection construction of low and moderate cost housing sequential orderly development and other goals set forth in the sausalito general plan and countywide general plan d there exist within marin logical and readily identifiable planning areas which include both incorporated and unincorporated areas but which must be precisely regulated by joint action of the county and the affected cities to ensure coordinated compliance with their respective general plans e at the present time in marin there are numerous inadequate water and sewerage systems serious overcrowding on public transit facilities extensive highway congestion severe flooding and seismic hazards of indeterminate scope all of which sorely limit the ability of the county and cities to accommodate unpaced burgeoning growth f the county numerous cities and special districts are diligently endeavoring to alleviate the serious problems set forth in subsection b3 of this section and will be able to resolve them only when essential if growth can be properly and effectively staged in a manner which will not overextend existing community facilities and allow some respite to bring deficient services up to necessary standards g it would be highly detrimental to the welfare of marin county and its environs to exclude intentionally or inadvertently minority poor or aged citizens from the general populace of marin county the only effective means to prevent such exclusion is the provision of ample low and moderate income housing significant federal subsidies are presently unavailable and traditional zoning has been ineffective in this regard although marin is actively engaged in numerous efforts to encourage and compel construction of low and moderate cost housing only review one of the principal purposes of which is achievement of this objective is there any likelihood of securing such housing h the public welfare requires the establishment of residential development review boards to accomplish the following 1 provide significant incentives which will encourage developers to include low and moderate income housing in their undertakings  2 prevent premature development in the absence of necessary utilities and municipal services  3 ensure that development will not exceed the environmental holding capacity of the specific land and the county generally  4 coordinate city and county planning and land regulation in a manner consistent with the countywide plan and local city general plans  5 facilitate and implement the realization of general plan goals which cannot be accomplished by zoning alone principally in connection with low and moderate cost housing  6 direct growth in a manner which will ensure a proper relationship to community needs and capabilities  7 encourage and facilitate development proposals which accomplish the objectives of the countywide general plan and the respective city general plans  1976  development review area established pursuant to the provisions of of the marin county the
