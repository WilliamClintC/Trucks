11 and the tenth section of chapter 17 is 1710 under this system each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments by way of illustration if new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 44 and 45 is desired to be added such new sections would be numbered 441 442 and 443 respectively new chapters may be included in the same manner if the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as chapter 125 care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters new articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or in the case of articles may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in the case of divisions may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject the next successive number being assigned to the article or division index the index has been prepared with the greatest of care each particular item has been placed under several headings some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees there are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as

and called the erosion and sediment control i 81009 jurisdiction the provisions of this article shall apply to all lands within the permitting jurisdiction of the city of fairhope ii 81009 purpose during the construction process soil is most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates repair of sewers and ditches dredging of watercourses and causes air quality impacts when sediment particles become entrapped in the atmosphere in addition clearing and grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation vegetation holds the soil in place holds and filters stormwater provides habitat for terrestrial and aquatic life and provides a healthy living environment for fairhope citizens as a result the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding and regulating the design construction use and maintenance of land disturbances in the city of fairhope iii 81009 definitions alabama handbook

intersecting street 20 125 25 150 30 200 35 225250 40 275325 45 325400 commentary large curb radii more easily accommodate right turns for vehicles but at the expense of pedestrians due to increased vehicle turning speeds and greater pedestrian crossing distances the curb radius standards balance these two competing concerns with respect to normalsized vehicles and normal traffic patterns intersections used infrequently by large vehicles normally accommodate turning movements by allowing the large vehicle to momentarily swing over the center line while any oncoming traffic yields in the case of intersections where frequent traffic by larger vehicles is expected larger radii may be necessary in addition closer to intersections on street parking is typically prohibited at these locations bumpouts in the curb can allow for shorter pedestrian crossings while still allowing curb radii which accommodate turning movements figure 56  clear sight lines measured from stopping point along centerline of intersecting street according to table 54 planning design standards street standards fairhope subdivision regulations 45 c traffic calming  to maintain design speeds specified in

engineering principles and are subject to the approval of the planning commission traffic calming devices may include but are not limited to 1 traffic circles  a circular raised island centered in the intersection around which traffic circulates traffic circles require no geometric changes to the intersection and merely alter the flow of traffic intersection << figure 57 >> 2 roundabouts  a circular raised island centered in the intersection roundabouts require traffic to circulate counterclockwise around a center island unlike traffic circles roundabouts require geometric alterations to the intersection and are used on higher volume streets to allocate rightsof way among competing movements << figure 58 >> 3 curb projections neck downs or bulbouts  curb extensions placed at midblock locations or at intersections which narrow the street to provide visual distinction and to reduce pedestrian crossing distances these are often used in conjunction with on street parking to define the

purpose of storm water retention and detention is to protect downstream properties from increases in flood heights due to development a combination of storage and controlled release of storm water shall be required for road construction nonresidential developments of one acre or more multifamily residential developments of one acre or more and single family developments of three acres or more the requirement for a combination of storage and controlled release of storm water is not required for minor subdivisions  however if the planning commission deems that the intensity of the development could cause offsite storm water flow impacts during or after development a combination of storage and controlled release shall be required the effective acreage for a project is not limited to a fractional part of the total concept  even though developed in phases it is the total area of the conceptual plans which governs storage and controlled release facilities may be required on smaller projects if it is determined in the planning commissions discretion that the intensity of the development could cause offsite storm water flow impacts during or after development the retention or detention whenever detention requirements are addressed by these regulations requirements also apply to retention facilities facilities must be designed to control peak flow from the outlet of the site such that postdevelopment flows are equal to or less than predeveloped peak flows for the 2year 5year 10year 25year 50year and 100year design storms however detaining the discharge from a site can sometimes exacerbate flooding downstream due to peak flow timing andor the increased volume of runoff coming from a site if detention facilities are indiscriminately placed in a watershed and changes to the peak flow timing are not considered the detention facility may result in an increase of the peak flow downstream another impact of new development is an increase in the total runoff volume of flow thus even if the peak flow is effectively attenuated the longer duration of higher flows due to the increased volume may combine with downstream storm water conveyance systems to increase downstream peak flows applicant must demonstrate analyses that the detention facility will not exacerbate flooding downstream b such facilities shall be owned operated and maintained by the development entities and shall not be accepted for inspection and maintenance by the city of fairhope the burden shall be on the developer and his engineer to provide evidence in support of any proposal to alter or modify the requirement for detention storm water runoff from new development or significant redevelopment must not adversely affect downstream properties in determining whether runoff from the new development or significant redevelopment causes an adverse impact the following procedures will be used 1 attenuate postdevelopment peak discharges to a level not to exceed the predevelopment discharges for the 2year year recurrence intervals 2 apply the ten percent rule this rule is based on the premise that at a point downstream of a development site where the drainage area above the development is 10 percent or less than the total drainage area at a point downstream of the development  then impacts related to storm water runoff from the development are minimal from this point downstream this rule recognizes that in addition to controlling the peak discharge from the outlet of a detention facility these facilities change the timing of the entire outflow hydrograph for the stream or planning design standards storm water standards fairhope subdivision regulations 64 river in question where required channel routing calculations must proceed downstream to a confluence point where the drainage area being analyzed represents ten percent or less of the total drainage area at this point if the effect of the hydrograph routed proposed storage facility on the downstream hydrograph is assessed and shown not to increase flows in downstream hydrographs detention can be waived if increased flows are found then backwater calculations and determination of flood elevations for the areas impacted by increased flows if any must be prepared where downstream increases in peak flows or flood elevations are shown detention will be required on site to attenuate storm water runoff from postdevelopment to predevelopment rates in the event that the city has developed a comprehensive plan for the area the recommendations within the comprehensive plan will establish the requirements for detention the city retains the right to require detention in areas of known flooding when detention will not exacerbate downstream flooding 3 the release rate from any detention facility should approximate that of the site prior to the proposed development for the 2year year storm events with emergency overflow capable of handling at least the 100year peak discharge except where waived or altered by the planning commission design of the detention pond shall be to insure that detention facilities will survive overtopping occurring for any reason including clogging of controlled outlets for the 100 year storm event detention systems must be constructed during the first phase of major developments to eliminate damage to adjacent properties during construction in this regard the detention systems shall be designed to function as sediment traps and cleaned out to proper storage volumes before completion if deposition of sediment has occurred detention systems must be restored to their design dimensions after construction is complete and certified as part of the asbuilt submittal c detention facilities shall be provided with obvious and effective control structures plan view sections and details of the structure shall be included in submittals sizing of the low flow pipe shall be by inlet control or hydraulic gradient requirements low flow pipe shall be not smaller than eight inches in diameter except in parking lot and roof retention where the size shall be designed for the particular application as approved by the commission d the overflow opening or spillway shall be designed to accept the total peak runoff of the improved tributary area proper engineering judgment with 25 year 50year or greater storm frequencies considered shall be exercised in secondary routing of discharge greater than the basic design storm for the protection of downstream properties e aerators are required for all retention ponds the public works director shall approve the specifications for said aerator 8 post development water quality best management practices  a storm water quality bmps for new development and significant redevelopment are required for projects that disturb three acres or more or subdivisions with four or more lots the effective acreage for a project is not limited to a fractional part of the total concept  even though developed in phases it is the total area of the conceptual plans which governs the bmps must be designed to achieve the goal of removing at least 80% of the average planning design standards storm water standards fairhope subdivision regulations 65 annual postconstruction total suspended solids tss load the storm water quality bmps will be considered in compliance with this requirement if  1 bmps are sized to capture and treat the water quality treatment volume which is defined as the runoff volume resulting from the first 18 inches of rainfall from a site  and 2 appropriate structural storm water bmps are selected designed constructed and maintained storm water quality bmps may be required on smaller projects if it is determined in the planning commissions discretion that the intensity of the development could cause offsite storm water impacts during or after development b the storm water quality treatment goal is designed to capture 85% of the annual storm water runoff storm water quality bmps must be designed to treat the runoff from the first 18 inches of rainfall each sites storm water quality treatment volume is also based on its percent impervious cover the treatment standard is the same for all sites unless other secondary pollutant reduction goals are established by adem  for instance establishment of total maximum daily loads tmdls the storm water quality treatment methodology to determine treatment volume is as follows a wqv   p  rv  12 where wqv   water quality treatment volume acrefeet p   rainfall for the 85% storm event 18 inches rv   runoff coefficient see below a   drainage area in acres rv    + i i   drainage area impervious cover in percent 50% imperviousness would be 50 c this storm water quality treatment goal is designed to give the developer flexibility in meeting the 80% tss reduction goal on each site bmps may be selected to meet the storm water quality requirements in numerous ways application of lowimpact site design and layout nonstructural bmps and structural bmps d the city encourages use of lowimpact site design practices that reduce the impact of development on storm water quality and quantity lowimpact site design practices are meant to 1 minimize the impervious cover on a site 2 preserve the natural infiltration ability of the site 3 route storm water to micro controls such as rain barrels rain gardens etc that treat small portions of site storm water from the site and 4 minimize longterm bmp maintenance by preserving and using natural features of the site planning design standards storm water standards fairhope subdivision regulations 66 e a developer should consider low impact site design practices early in the design process in an effort to reduce the overall water quality treatment volume requirement these practices tie directly into the storm water quality program the wqv calculation andor the storm water treatment volume these practices should only be implemented when not in conflict with other city regulations f structural storm water controls or best management practices bmps are engineered structures designed to treat storm water or mitigate the impact from storm water runoff the following table presents a preapproved listing of structural bmp practices these bmps have been assigned a tss removal capability based upon existing research and can be used by developers to meet the pollutant reduction goal of 80% tss removal the structural bmps have been divided into two categories 1 general application bmps are assumed to achieve the 80% tss reduction 2 limited application bmps which have to be used in combination with other bmps to achieve the 80% reduction goal these bmps may not be applicable for certain sites and require frequent intensive maintenance to function properly preapproved bmps bmp removal efficiency for total suspended solids tss structural control tss removal % general application bmps wet pond 80

stream channels due to development is the primary cause of accelerated streambank erosion and widening and downcutting of stream channels therefore streambank protection criterion applies to all development sites for which there is an increase in the natural flows to downstream feeder streams channels ditches and small streams onsite or downstream improvements may be required for streambank protection easements or rightofentry agreements also may need to be obtained h the developer should determine if existing downstream streambank cover is adequate to convey storm water velocities for postdevelopment conditions planning design standards storm water standards fairhope subdivision regulations 67 this can be accomplished by first obtaining postdeveloped velocities for the streambank protection 2year storm event in the downstream conveyance system these velocities are then compared to the allowable velocity of the downstream receiving system if the downstream system is designed to handle the increase in velocity as a result of the proposed development the developer should provide all supporting calculations andor documentation to demonstrate that the downstream storm water conveyance system will not be compromised as a result of the development 1 if the increased velocities are higher than the allowable velocity of the downstream receiving system then the developer may choose to reinforcestabilize the downstream conveyance system the proposed modifications must be designed so that the downstream postdevelopment velocities for the 2 5 10 and 25year storm events are less than or equal to either the allowable velocity of the downstream receiving system or the predevelopment velocities whichever is higher the developer must provide supporting calculations andor documentation that downstream velocities do not exceed the allowable range once the downstream modifications are installed 2 the developer may use onsite controls to keep downstream postdevelopment discharges at or below allowable velocity limits the developer must provide supporting calculations andor documentation that the onsite controls will be designed such that downstream velocities for the three 3 storm events are within an allowable range once the onsite controls are installed 3 another approach to meet the stream bank protection requirement is to provide 24 hours of extended detention onsite for postdeveloped storm water runoff generated by the 1year 24hour rainfall event 45 inches to protect downstream channels the required volume for extended detention is referred to as the streambank protection volume spv the reduction in the frequency and duration of bankfull flows controlled release provided by extended detention of the spv will reduce the bank scour rate and severity i stormwater bmps with either a permanent pool of water or that will hold storm water for an extended period of time can potentially provide mosquitobreeding habitat however if structural bmps are properly designed installed and maintained mosquito problems can be minimized bmps with open water such as storm water ponds shall require aeration for mosquito control the public works

recommendation regarding the waiver e the planning commission shall consider the waiver the applicants documentation and third finding and city planning department recommendation and make a final determination as to the waiver request f the following lid techniques are available for use by applicants given the particular circumstances and characteristics of the proposed subdivision 1 wet basins the city finds the potential benefits of wet basins are among other items allowing sedimentation to fall out of stormwater attenuating flows assisting in evapotranspiration and improving the stormwater quality special design considerations are groundwater elevations large surface areas are encouraged special attention should be given in pervious soil surface area of the basin should take into account nutrient loading from lawns for example in order to treat and improve stormwater quality to the maximum extent possible ensuring that an adequate base flow is provided to maintain water levels they are not recommended to be constructed in an inline facility utilize low slopes the use of forbays are recommended upstream and downstream areas shall be considered in the design in accordance with fairhope standards recommended characteristics are the approach slopes should be  or less around the perimeter side slopes  or less below the water level beyond the safety bench safety bench just below water elevation 4 wide 612 deep energy is dissipated prior to entering the basin can be excavated below the ground surface 2 rain gardens the city finds the potential benefits of rain gardens are among other items small scale flow attenuation infiltration limited planning design standards storm water standards fairhope subdivision regulations 70 evapotranspiration allowing sediments to be trapped and water quality treatment special design considerations are typically smaller areas and drainage areas are used for rain garden design special attention should be given in pervious soils recommended for use in hydrologic soil groups a and b not recommended in high swell soils recommended characteristics are small scale and frequent use in drainage areas the choice of landscaping materials soil mix and other characteristics are crucial to the success of a rain garden rain gardens can be highly visible and utilized as a visual amenity in a proposed development 3 permeable pavement systems the city finds the potential benefits of permeable pavement systems are among other items flow attenuation infiltration and filtration of stormwater there are many products and strategies that can be utilized and the city is open to the use of varied products in accordance with manufacture recommendations consultation with the city prior to design of the product to be utilized is suggested special design consideration are use in areas with hydrologic soil groups a and b special attention should be given in pervious conditions not recommended in areas with high swell soils ground water tables should not impact the ability of water to infiltrate the technique works best in low slopes 4 sand filter the city finds that the potential benefits of sand filters are among other items flow attenuation infiltration reducing sedimentation and providing filtration of storm water special design considerations are best used in small drainage areas special attention should be given in pervious soils recommended use in areas with soils with good permeability in hydrological soil groups a and b not recommended in high swell soils 5 grass swales the city finds that the potential benefits of grass swales are among other items in straining stormwater providing limited quality treatments while providing some moderate flow attenuation special design considerations are typically work best in smaller drainage areas where volumes are reduced special consideration should be given in pervious soils not recommended with high swell soils should have low slopes adjacent areas and layout should be considered in the design suggested characteristics where topography soils and slope permit vegetated open channels and spaces should be considered as a significant or a primary means of stormwater conveyance 6 grass buffers the city finds that the potential benefits of grass buffers are among other items in straining stormwater providing limited quality treatments while providing some moderate flow attenuation planning design standards storm water standards fairhope subdivision regulations 71 special design considerations are typically work best in smaller drainage areas where volumes are reduced special consideration should be given in pervious soils not recommended with high swell soils should have low slopes adjacent areas and layout should be considered in the design suggested characteristics where topography soils and slope permit vegetated open channels and spaces should be considered as a significant or a primary means of stormwater conveyance 7 constructed wetland channels or wetlands the city finds that the potential benefits of constructed wetland channels or wetlands are among other items flow attenuation buffering of flooding events evapotranspiration sedimentation and treatment of stormwater quality special design considerations are not recommended in high swell soils low slope forebay is recommended primary benefit of pollutant removal not volume reduction adjacent areas should be considered in the design 8 step pool stormwater conveyance structures the city finds that a step pool stormwater conveyance structure may attenuate stormwater flows provides evapotranspiration reduce sediment transport and water quality treatment special design considerations are not recommended in high swell soils adjacent areas should be taken into consideration in order to ensure long term viability of step pool structures and adjacent erosion 9 inline stormwater storage the city finds that inline storage may provide for attenuation and limits sedimentation special design considerations are designed to be selfcleaning where possible or suitable clean out access is provided and designed into the system designed to surcharge nonsensitive areas with no flooding in parking lots structures or other typically occupied spaces 10 site design for habitat wetland and water body conservation the city finds that site design that incorporates the natural features of the property can help to minimize erosion and reduce stress on natural water conveyance and attenuation systems by preserving a natural vegetated state of native plants water courses and flood prone areas suggested characteristics are the technique may be used in conjunction with the citys planned unit development or village subdivision processes to propose alternative street layouts and design so that impervious areas and other improvements are sited with due regard to the natural elements of the property special design considerations to consider adjacent areas in the design since important natural features that utilize this lid technique often extends past property lines or the phases of proposed development planning design standards storm water standards fairhope subdivision regulations 72 11 restoration of habitat or wetlands and water bodies the city finds that the restoration of habitat or wetland and water bodies can be productive to improve the environment by minimizing erosion and reducing stress on natural water conveyance and attenuation systems by preserving a natural vegetated state of native plants water courses and flood prone areas suggested characteristics are this technique may be used in conjunction with the citys planned unit development or village subdivision processes to propose alternative street layouts and design so that impervious areas and other improvements are sited with due regard to the natural elements of the property use only native plants in the development process and take special consideration to restore portions of the site to predevelopment native ecological communities water bodies or wetlands with more than 10% of the development footprint special design considerations to consider adjacent areas in the design since important natural features that utilize this lid technique often extend past property lines or the phases of proposed development 12greenways the city finds that greenways provide for beneficial use of lid for potentially active and passive recreation opportunities and wildlife corridors this technique allows for the creative integration into a development proposal that is frequently linked with other natural or recreation systems that extend past the property lines of the proposed development suggested characteristics typically greenways are easier to integrate into a development proposal on larger acreages they are frequently utilized as linear parks and often include sensitive wetland areas steep slopes gullies or other natural land forms creeks and unique wildlife habitat for protected species 13 restoring channel morphology and natural function the city finds that restoring channel morphology and natural function provides for flow attenuation infiltration and reduces sedimentation special considerations are typically works most effectively in larger development proposals where a substantial linear footage of channel can be restored it is important to consider the upstream and downstream current and future characteristics so conversation of land use in accounted for in the design 14 bioretention the city finds that bioretention provides for flow attenuation infiltration limited evapotranspiration reduced sedimentation and stormwater quality treatment suggested characteristics are to be used as both a stormwater and aesthetic feature frequently throughout developments special attention should be given to plant and ground cover considerations given the volume and duration of the designed stormwater planning design standards storm water standards fairhope subdivision regulations 73 special design considerations are typically work best in small drainage areas with frequent use and distribution special attention is required in pervious soils and should be used in areas with high permeable soils hydrologic soils groups a and b not recommended in high swell soils 15 level spreader the city finds that level spreaders can be an effective tool to evenly distribute flows and return volumes and velocity to a predevelopment distribution pattern there are limited stormwater straining and water quality improvements suggested characteristics are level spreaders are intended to work in a complimentary fashion with other lid techniques such as but not limited to sand filters and grass buffers special design considerations are typically level spreaders are used downstream of an outfall and have a low slope with stabilized and vegetated buffers both up and downstream they typically are installed a suitable distance from the property line 3035 is suggested so that flow energy is dissipated and predevelopment sheet flow characteristics are generated special consideration should be given in areas with highly erodible soils 16additional information regarding lid techniques is included in the document planning for stormwater developing a

or greenspace 2 types of open space the following table 41 indicates the categories types and general sizes of open space that can be used to meet the city requirements for open space and greenspace generally there are two categories  natural and civic natural open space is most appropriate in neighborhoods rural areas or at the edges of village developments it can also be used at any location where significant natural features warrant preservation civic open space is most appropriate in convenient locations easily accessible by a large number of people typically this will be at the center of a residential neighborhood or in a village or commercial center site design standards open space fairhope zoning ordinance 32 table 41 open space categories and types category type description size recommendation image natural open space preserve an undeveloped area that contains significant natural features or habitat worthy of preservation features such as large stands of trees water elements or prominent topography characterize preserves a preserve may by use for passive recreation or as a scenic and visual buffer it generally contains little or no constructed improvements although trails may access the preserve the size of a preserve open space should be based on the site characteristics and potential continuity of natural features in the area along with the potential to connect to adjacent natural areas trail  greenway an undeveloped area of continuous linear natural features often following a stream or floodplain a trail or greenway should be usable for recreation and nonmotorized transportation it includes few constructed improvements except for those to enhance travel or recreational use generally should include at least 3 acres but should be sized and located based on providing significant continuity throughout a development and to areas beyond the development area must be at least 30 wide at all locations park an undeveloped natural area for unstructured recreation a park may include some areas for structured recreation such as ball fields but generally this area should occupy no more than 25% of the total area parks are located based on the presence

landscaping plan submitted in accordance with this subsection shall include technique 5 below and at least one of the other following techniques page 2 i first flush treatment the lid landscaping design shall be sized appropriately to treat the first one inch of runoff into the receiving parking lot lid area 2 bioretention 3 rain garden 4 vegetated swale 5 permeable pavement systems permeable pavement systems are a required lid technique i 00% of parking provided over and above the minimum parking requirements shall be permeable pavement systems typical systems are brick pavers pervious asphalt and pervious concrete other systems may be approved if the design engineer provides adequate documentation that demonstrates the proposed technique is equally or more effective that the typical permeable systems listed approval of a proposed technique is at the sole discretion of the city during the permitting process 6 tree and ground cover plantings when trees are required in a parking lot by the tree shall be included and integrated into the lid design species shall be as approved by the city horticulturist and must be suggested by the landscape architect or designer there shall be no bare ground exposed and all ground cover proposed shall be integral to the success of lid techniques all ground cover shall be as approved by the city horticulturist and must be suggested by the landscape architect or designer 5 that definitions and interpretation defined terms are amended to add the following a bioretention this technique removes pollutants in stormwater runoff filtration  sedimentation volatilization ion exchange and biological decomposition a bioretention cell brc is a depression in the landscape that captures and stores runoff for a short time while providing habitat for native vegetation that is both flood and drought tolerant brcs are stormwater control measures scms that are similar to the homeowner practice of installing rain gardens with the exception that brcs have an underlying specialized soil media and are designed to meet a desired stormwater quantity treatment storage volume peak runoff rates and runoff volumes can be reduced and groundwater can be recharged when bioretention is located in an area with the appropriate soil conditions to provide infiltration bioretention is normally designed for the water quality or first flush event typically the first i 15 of rainfall to treat stormwater pollutants b vegetated swale is a shallow openchannel stabilized with grass or other herbaceous vegetation designed to filter pollutants and convey stormwater swales are applicable along roadsides in parking lots residential subdivisions commercial developments and are well suited to singlefamily residential and campus type developments water quality swales are designed to meet sheer stress targets for the design storm may be characterized as wet or dry swales may contain amended soils to infiltrate stormwater runoff and are generally planted with turf grass or other herbaceous vegetation c first flush this is the given volume of water generated in the drainage area from the first i to 15 of rainfall page 3 d rain garden a shallow depression in a landscape that captures water and holds it for a short period of time to allow for infiltration filtration of pollutants habitat for native plants and effective storm water treatment for smallscale residential or commercial drainage areas rain gardens use native plants mulch and soil to clean up runoff severability clause if any part section or subdivision ofthis
