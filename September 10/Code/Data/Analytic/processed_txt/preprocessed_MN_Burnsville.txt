against the inception and transmission of disease and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations the provisions  sterling codifiers inc  159771 of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market b findings studies conducted by the american planning association the minnesota attorney generals office and the governments of st paul minneapolis and ramsey minnesota  st croix county wisconsin

impacts on surrounding neighborhoods those impacts included increased crime rates lower property values increased transiency neighborhood blight and potential health risks based on these studies and findings the city council concludes 1 minnesota statutes section  allows the city to adopt regulations to promote the public health safety morals and general welfare 2 the public health safety morals and general welfare will be promoted by the city adopting regulations governing sexually oriented businesses 3 sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary impacts of the type found in the studies referenced in this chapter 4 the adverse impacts caused by sexually oriented businesses tend to diminish if sexually oriented businesses are governed by location requirements licensing requirements and health requirements 5 it is not the intent to prohibit sexually oriented businesses from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city 6 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented business a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 7 the fact that an

overlay district to establish a policy of sound stewardship of regulations which conserve protect enhance and result in the no net loss of these environmentally sensitive resources in addition it is the intent of the city to promote the restoration of degraded wetlands this overlay district is adopted in part to implement the wetland conservation act of 1991 minnesota laws 199 chapter 354 as

to certain slopes or unstable soils create ecological problems including siltation and pollution of water bodies and streams due to excessive erosion and runoff and present threats to the public safety in the form of landslide and mudslide dangers therefore the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public safety by minimizing the hazards of certain slopes and unstable soils and promote public health by reducing the siltation and pollution of water bodies and streams and promote the general welfare by preserving significant features of the natural character of slopes and conditioning development in a manner that minimizes the above enumerated threats to the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city  c restrictive soils overlay district areas within the city are characterized by certain soil types slopes and water levels which without proper corrective action are unsuitable for development inappropriate development in those areas increases soil erosion and sedimentation the introduction of toxic materials into groundwater encourages pollution destroys ecological and natural resources and requires expenditures of public funds to correct deficiencies thereby acting to the detriment of the health safety and welfare of the citizens of burnsville therefore the purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of development on restrictive soils in such a way as to minimize the risk of environmental damage and to protect private homeowners and governmental units from incurring high maintenance and capital costs resulting from the necessity to correct deficiencies encountered as a result of development on poorly suited soils d woodland overlay district the preservation of trees and woodlands within the city is critical to the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city as well as those of the metropolitan area existing and potential development within the city and the metropolitan area has the effect of reducing and in some cases eliminating wooded areas which if preserved and maintained serve important ecological recreational and aesthetic functions to the benefit of present and future residents of the city

per acre for the zoning district in effect at the time the building permit is issued minus the amount of park dedication paid during the interim use periods equals the balance of cash dedication due
