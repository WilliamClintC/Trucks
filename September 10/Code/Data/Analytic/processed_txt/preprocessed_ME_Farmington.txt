exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 14 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 15 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 16 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 17 the findings noted in paragraphs 1 raise substantial governmental concerns 18 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 19 a reasonable permitting procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the 5 burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a permitting procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the permittee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 20 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 21 requiring permittees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 22 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 23 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this ordinance is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 24 the fact that an applicant for an adult use permit has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 26 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this 4 conflict with other ordinances whenever a provision of this with

composition and may elicit a broad spectrum of responses by the receptors special methods must be employed in their measurement and characterization although analytical data are more precise and may be useful in identifying a source it is the human response or the sensory data that is most critical in determining the necessary degree of odor control analytical data may be used to specify permissible emission levels from a source but sensory data must be employed to assess the impact in the surrounding community the latter is the towns primary concern 2 administration and enforcement
