controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in  102a1 hereof this chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety  i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed
