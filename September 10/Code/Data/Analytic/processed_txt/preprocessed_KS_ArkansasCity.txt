statements as to the present classification the classification under the proposed amendment the reasons for seeking such reclassification a summary of the facts presented and a statement of the factors upon which the recommendation of the planning commission is based using the following guidelines a whether the change in classification would be consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations b the character and condition of the surrounding neighborhood and its 266 effect on the proposed change this entails a description of the neighborhood as to existing land uses intensity of development age and general condition of structures c whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or changing conditions in the area affected and if so the nature of such changed or changing conditions d the current zoning and uses of nearby properties and the effect on existing nearby land uses upon such a change in classification the zoning surrounding the property at issue along with the actual uses on those properties is to be considered e whether every use that would be permitted on the property as reclassified would be compatible with the uses permitted on other property in the immediate vicinity consideration is to be given as to whether each of the permitted uses under the proposed rezoning would be compatible with existing uses the focus is upon issues which can be addressed via zoning such as structure height yards and setbacks and minimum lot sizes f the suitability of the applicants property for the uses to which it has been restricted how the property at issue is presently zoned and the uses permitted under that zoning is to be considered as well as whether those uses are appropriate given the zoning of the surrounding neighborhood also to be considered is whether the presently allowed uses are the only uses appropriate for the subject property g the length of time the subject property has remained vacant or undeveloped as zoned consideration is to be given as to whether the subject property is vacant because its present zoning is unsuitable or whether it is vacant for reasons unrelated to zoning eg a surplus of similarlyzoned property problems with financing lack of infrastructure or other development problems h whether adequate sewer and water facilities and all other needed public services exist or can be provided to serve the uses that would be permitted on the property if it were reclassified i the general amount of vacant land that currently has the same zoning classification proposed for the subject property particularly in the vicinity of the subject property and any special circumstances that make a substantial part of such vacant land available or not available for development j the recommendations of professional staff and advisors staff 267 recommendations should be based upon the factors set out in this section the adopted comprehensive plan other adopted plans and reports and the evidence in the record k whether the proposed amendment would be in conformance to and further enhance the implementation of the citys comprehensive plan the question here is whether the requested rezoning is consistent with the recommendations of the adopted comprehensive plan if it is not is the incompatibility because the plan is outdated or have conditions changed in the area or neighborhood of the subject property l whether the relative gain to the public health safety and general welfare outweighs the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not upgrading the value of the property by such reclassification this factor acknowledges that the basis for zoning is protection of public health safety and welfare any rezoning request involves balancing the property owners interests with the interests of the public m such other factors as the planning commission may deem relevant from the facts and evidence presented in the application 26109 applications for conditional use permit because of particular conditions associated with their activities certain uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future development of a district are not permitted outright in districts but are allowed as conditional uses when their proposed location is supplemented by additional requirements so as to make the use requested compatible with the surrounding property the neighborhood and the zoning jurisdiction 26110 factors to be considered in permit applications the planning commission may recommend approval of a conditional use that is expressly authorized to be permitted in a particular zoning district and the governing body may approve such conditional use using the following factors as guidelines following the same explanation of those factors as set out n for rezonings a whether approval of the conditional use would be consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations  b whether the location of the proposed use is compatible to other land uses in the surrounding neighborhood  c whether the proposed use places an undue burden on the existing public infrastructure in the area affected and if so whether additional infrastructure can be provided  268 d whether the proposed use is made necessary or desirable because of changed or changing conditions in the area affected  e the length of time the subject property has remained vacant or undeveloped as zoned  f whether the applicants property is suitable for the proposed conditional use  g the recommendations of professional staff and advisors  h whether the proposed conditional use would be in conformance to and further enhance the implementation of the citys comprehensive plan  i whether the proposed conditional use if it complies with all the conditions upon which the approval is made contingent will not adversely affect the property in the area affected  j for such uses as solid waste disposal facilities including sanitary landfills construction and demolition landfills and transfer stations whether the proposed conditional use is consistent with any adopted solid waste management plan of cowley county and amendments thereto  and k such other factors as the planning commission may deem relevant from the facts and evidence presented in the application conditional use permits 26201 the application notice public hearing and action procedures set forth in this be applicable to all applications for conditional use permits submitted after the effective date of these regulations 26202 the governing body

271601 procedures for requesting a variance to the sign regulations can be found in of these regulations design review 271701 administrative design review an optional design review process one that is voluntarily entered into by applicants rather than a mandatory one this option allows the applicant to choose between designing a sign strictly according to numerical standards or going design review process that allows for larger signs more flexibility or both for example the numerical standard for a projecting sign might consist of a maximum allowable area of x square feet this would probably produce a simple rectangular sign maximizing the copy area under an optional design review process the sign area could be increased by a certain percentage or sq footage the sign could include a unique eyecatching logo that would add liveliness to the streetscape such a method rewards both businesses and sign producers for creative efforts  a framework for on premise sign regulations march

welfare therefore the city commission of the city of arkansas city kansas ordains as follows findings of fact co 1 flood losses resultingfrom periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of arkansas city kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes ofthe flood losses these flood losses are caused by  1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and  2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study  fis that is the basis of this ordinance uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps water resources received p jun 09 2010 ks dept of agriculture fema rvii& kdadwr 2 202003  model 603 d a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance the base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis ofthe capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in  1  to establish or maintain the community s eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program  nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations  cfr 5922 a 3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603 d and kar 5 444 by applying the provisions of  this ordinance to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial
