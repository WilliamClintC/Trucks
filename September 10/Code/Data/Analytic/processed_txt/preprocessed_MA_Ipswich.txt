relating to the town of ipswich persons using this index should recognize thatreference to the text of each statute as enacted is essential to a completeunderstanding thereof the notes which accompany the index merely summarize briefly the subject matter of the statutes each statute is citedby reference to the acts and resolves of massachusetts the index begins with the year 1920 simply because an arbitrary decision was made that earlier special enactments would have little or no practicalsignificance for persons interested in determining what is the governingbody of law under which the town operates presently note also the adoption in 196 of the home rule amendment socalled to the massachusetts constitution  and to the enactment at a specialsession of the general court in 196 of home rule procedures which became of the general laws the homerule amendment provides in that the general court shall act inrelation to cities and towns only by general laws which apply alike to all cities or to all towns or to all cities and towns or to a class of not fewer than two special laws which apply to particular municipalities areauthorized in only four situations which are specifically

associated systems shall be inspected for functionality and damage at least twice each year by the boards subdivision inspector or an agent of the town the costs for such inspection shall be borne by the applicant  2 the applicant shall be responsible for cleaning sediment and debris from catch basins at least annually  additional cleaning may be required by the board  3 the applicant shall be responsible for removal of trees bushes andor other growth in the sedimentation basins and for keeping live native species vegetative cover on the banks of such basins replacements for dead vegetative cover and reseeding shall be completed promptly  4 the applicant shall repair or replace any damaged system to the satisfaction of the board  the applicant shall be responsible for any damage due to flaws in design or construction  and 5 the applicant shall be responsible for cosmetic maintenance such as periodic mowing of grassed areas in sedimentation basins d acceptance of the system 1 prior to any acceptance by the town or by another entity the control structures shall be subject to a final inspection by the boards subdivision inspector andor the towns agent  the cost of inspection shall be borne by the applicant  the inspection shall assure compliance with the following elements a the system has been constructed in accordance with the plans approved by the board  b all construction debris has been removed  c sediment has been flushed from pipes by a pressure wash  d catch basins and detentionretention structures are free of sediment  and e ground cover is fully established on banks 2 2 no release of security for erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be granted until the board is satisfied that the systems comply with the plans  3 if as a result of the final inspection the applicant is found to be in noncompliance with the plans the board may use the security to assure that the control systems isare brought to into conformance and isare cleaned and maintained properly in accordance with the plans 7 general requirements the applicant shall secure future maintenance of the stormwater system by a proper bond or by a deposit of money of an amount as determined by the board such security must be established to the satisfaction of the board prior to release of any lots within the development and prior to the boards signoff of building permits 67 rules and regulations governing the subdivision of land in ipswich massachusetts in the event that the applicant does not follow maintenance procedures and programs as approved by the board the board shall have the authority to expend any portion of said security to provide such maintenance in the event that the stormwater system is accepted by the town or any private association andor trust and

deemed appropriate by the board 68 rules and regulations governing the subdivision of land in ipswich massachusetts ix rules and regulations governing sedimentation and erosion control 1 purpose and intent these regulations are to prevent adverse environmental impacts due to erosion soil loss and sedimentation including secondary and cumulative caused by alterations to vegetation and soil surfaces during land development sedimentation and erosion control structures are required to prevent sediment from clogging stormwaterdrainage systems and road ditches these structures also prevent sediment from entering ponds streams reservoirs watercourses wetlands and other critical resources within which it is a pollutant in many cases these structures detain stormwater runoff thus preventing flooding of downstream areas responsibility for periodic inspection maintenance and repair of these control structures and systems to insure they continue to operate consistent with approved design lies solely with the applicant until such time as the streets and all other improvements in the subdivision are accepted by the town 2 general requirements a if the applicants proposed
