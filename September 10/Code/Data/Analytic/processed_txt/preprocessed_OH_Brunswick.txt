chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 40506 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 405 or the 6th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 21310 indicates the code number is 2 the chapter number is 213 or the 13th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 67506 and precede 67507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the

brunswick city council makes the following statement of intent and findings 1 adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from the public safety agencies of the city in order to protect and preserve the health safety morals and welfare of the patrons and employees of the businesses as well as the citizens of the city 2this council finds that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 3the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of this city that demands reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by this city in the specified manner and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by local governments in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens 4minimal regulations enacted by this city are a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 5there is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment establishments because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them cause increased crime particularly in the overnight hours and downgrade property values 6this council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner and by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects this council seeks to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight 7this council has determined that current local zoning and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of this city and that expanded regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary 8it is not the intent of this council in enacting this act to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact contentneutral statutes that address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments 9it is not the intent of this council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and this council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this state  b it is the intent of this council in enacting this chapter to regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of this city and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments within this city the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent of this council in enacting this chapter to restrict or deny or authorize the restriction or denial of access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny or authorize the denial of access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this council in enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene material  cbased on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on communities presented in hearings and in reports made available to the legislature and subsequently adopted by the ohio general assembly as findings under of house bill 23 this council finds 1adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments 2certain employees of adult entertainment establishments as defined in this adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adult entertainment establishments especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows the couch dances or lap dances that frequently occur in adult entertainment establishments featuring live nude or seminude dancers constitute or may constitute the offense of engaging in prostitution under of the revised 4offering and providing private or semiprivate booths or cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of those adult entertainment establishments 6numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hiv aids genital herpes hepatitis salmonella campylobacter and shigella infections chlamydial myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections trichomoniasis and chancroid 7sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 8sexually oriented businesses as a category of commercial uses are often associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including but not limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on surrounding properties urban blight litter and sexual assault and exploitation 9illegal and unsanitary acts involving nudity including lewd conduct masturbation oral and anal sex occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses including those businesses which provide private or semi private rooms booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live performances 10each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which this city has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating this substantial governmental interest in preventing secondary effects which is this citys rationale for this chapter exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and nonsexually oriented businesses additionally this citys interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may located in this city the city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects 11adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that require or subject them to reasonable government regulation in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 12the enactment of this chapter will promote the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this city passed 71315  84402  definitions aas used in this chapter 1adult bookstore adult cabaret adult motion picture theater adult

for a community focal point gathering place and city center the centerpiece of the development is brunswick lake a site that provides spectacular natural beauty and is unique to the city of brunswick the site offers pedestrian access to a number of existing neighborhoods and community facilities located on a main city thoroughfare route 303 the brunswick town center has been designed according to traditional town planning principles adapted to the patterns of today a conceptual development plan has been created working with the city and developers that illustrates the types of buildings streets blocks and neighborhoods envisioned for this site divided into five distinct and unique neighborhoods or districts the plan provides living shopping and entertainment opportunities as well as community services in an environment that offers a unique natural setting the lakefront is open to the public over the vast majority of the site and is planned to incorporate a variety of public and pedestrian amenities passed 72202 ii the neighborhoods the main street district the central focus and community gathering place of the brunswick town center is the main street district sited along route 303 on the eastern edge of the lake this district is composed of a mixture of uses that include two large anchor stores to draw people to the site  smaller shops and services lining a treelined boulevard with the potential for office space on buildings upper levels  community buildings including a potential community pavilion at the lakefront  and opportunities for residential uses to occur either above shops or in individual apartment buildings main street begins with its entrance at route 303 and terminates with a grand view of the lakefront at brunswick lake street buildings are envisioned to line one side of brunswick lake street providing the backdrop for community events and festivals along the lakefront the southwest neighborhood the southwest neighborhood is a residential district of approximately 100 homes designed as a traditional neighborhood the plan creates common green spaces for public use and a fully public lakefront to be shared by residents and visitors alike two house types occur in this district courtyard homes front a large neighborhood park that is oriented toward the lake private courtyards are a common feature of these homes an alley system puts garages at the rear of the courtyard homes and allows wide front porches and main entrances at the street frontloaded homes occur at the edges of the site with main entrances and garages accessed off the neighborhood streets the peninsula neighborhood a single street lined with unique custom homes located along the spine of the peninsula is the address for the peninsula neighborhood special features such as architectural towers will offer homes spectacular views of the brunswick lake landscape the entire edge of the peninsula is open to the public and will be designed with trails and other public amenities for public access a special pavilion will be located at the tip of the peninsula as part of the trail system the northwest neighborhood a mixeduse district with the potential for office development that is oriented toward the lake and visible from route 303 the northwest neighborhood provides a natural setting combined with high visibility the northwest neighborhood is envisioned as a unique office environment with the potential for residential uses to occur on upper levels or in separate buildings and for retail uses to occur on ground floors of buildings in addition the northwest neighborhood is suitable for institutional uses such as medical or educational facilities the southeast neighborhood topography and wetlands make the southeast neighborhood unique residential neighborhoods of medium density are designed around the sites natural features additionally a site for a prominent civic building along brunswick lake street is reserved in the southeast neighborhood curvilinear streets and irregular shaped blocks create a hilltown type of character this allows for many homes to have natural views and connections to the land that will be preserved as wetland environments the district closest to the main street district is designed with a higher density providing more opportunities for activity and vibrancy in the main street district at different times of the day or the week passed 72202 plan evolution as the process of implementing the conceptual development plan proceeds changes will occur the plan shows

promoting the health safety and general welfare of its citizens therefore the city council of the city of brunswick state of ohio does ordain as follows bfindings of fact 1the city of brunswick has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss in order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth these regulations are adopted cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and minimize future flood blight areas  7ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  8minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near flood prone areas  9ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the floodplain are maintained  10minimize the impact of development on the natural beneficial values of the floodplain  11prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible  and 12meet
