or harassment of any kind any actions words comments or adverse conduct toward an employee based on race religion national origin age sex protected activity including opposition to discrimination or illegal harassment or any other unwelcome legally protected factor is strictly prohibited violation of this policy will lead to severe disciplinary action including possible termination this prohibition specifically applies to sexual harassment although it is difficult to define sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances requests for sexual favors touching comments or jokes of a sexual nature and any other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature sexual harassment also may include intimidating or hostile conduct toward an employee because of the employees gender any

harassment on the basis of religion religious beliefs or views concerning religion the united states constitution expressly prohibits establishment or endorsement of religion by a governmental entity it thus is critical that there be a clear division between religion and employment policies and practices the citys personnel policies reflect these mandates by requiring all employment decisions to be based on merit not religious views the federal equal employment opportunity commission has determined that employers must protect their employees from harassment or intimidation on the basis of religious beliefs or practices pursuant to federal law a person holding supervisory authority over an employee may not explicitly or implicitly insist that any employee participate in religious activities or hold religious beliefs as a condition of continued employment promotion job assignments or any other aspect of employment a supervisor preaching religion or proselytizing to employees on the job requiring attendance at devotional services at work or singling out an employee for unpleasant tasks because the supervisor disagreed with the employees religious beliefs all have been deemed to violate federal law obviously it would be illegal to fire an employee for differences in religious views employees are free to hold any religious belief and during nonworking time are free to practice or not practice any religious observance the city also will accommodate employees religious beliefs to the extent possible during working time however the city of butler will not tolerate any adverse treatment or harassment of employees on the basis of religion  62006   employee benefits the city attempts to provide a competitive package of fringe benefits for its employees although the

within the time required by this chapter f legislative purpose and intent the city council makes the following findings of legislative purposes and intent 1 that the expression of political speech is an important and constitutionally protected right 2 that under certain circumstances it may be necessary to restrict or regulate the time place and manner of the expression of such speech in order to advance and protect other significant legitimate interests of local government 3 that political signs have certain characteristics that distinguish them from many of the other types of signs permitted and regulated by the city these characteristics include the fact that many of such signs intended to be temporary in nature do not meet the regular structural and installation requirements necessary to prevent them from being affected by weather and other natural forces and presenting a potential hazard to persons and property severe weather conditions including without limitation thunderstorms with accompanying high winds tornados ice accumulation and flooding are characteristic of local weather conditions with respect to the temporary nature of such signs the durational and illumination regulations provide a channel of communication on an election candidate or issue balancing the aesthetic and public health and safety concerns surrounding temporary structures 4 that the primary purpose of political signs placed along a roadway is to attract the attention of drivers and distract them from their primary responsibility of constant attention to traffic and road conditions this concern is especially acute in residential areas where young children present a significant potential hazard for drivers with respect to residential areas with their lower speed limits it is concluded that political signs not exceeding twentysix 26 inches by twentysix 26 inches on each side although it is recognized that certain individuals may wish to express political thoughts that require a larger area to adequately convey them a greater number of or larger and more complex messages would further distract drivers attention presenting an unacceptable safety risk and there exists in the community adequate other means for conveying such message in nonresidential areas motorists frequently see and reasonably expect to see larger signs so their attention is not as easily distracted and higher speed limits larger lot areas and a larger size sign can be allowed consistent with safety requirements further since permitted signage in residential areas is minimal the aesthetic impact of signs in residential areas is much greater than in nonresidential areas 5 that in addition to the safety and traffic interests affected by political signs the city council concludes that the unrestricted proliferation of political signs would create visual clutter have an adverse effect on the aesthetic quality of the city with accompanying adverse economic effects and detract from the desirable visual environment that the city has made a strong effort to create land use regulations 6 that the city council concludes that the interests to be protected by this regula tion are sufficiently substantial to justify the contentneutral regulation of political speech represented by this section and that this section represents a reasonable accommodation of the citys interest with first amendment rights    liability insurance the owner or person in control of a sidewalk or other display sign or a sign suspended over a street or extending into a street more than one 1 foot beyond the building line whether permanent or temporary shall provide a certificate of insurance in the amount of five hundred thousand dollars $50000000 and the city of butler named as additional

area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible  and 4 ensure that regulation of wireless communications facilities does not have the effect of prohibiting the
