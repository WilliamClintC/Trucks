only with restrictions as herein contained the purpose of this to provide for the restrictions of nonconforming buildings structures and uses and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings structures and uses shall be permitted to continue definitions unless otherwise specifically provided or unless clearly required by the context the words and phrases defined in this section shall have the meaning indicated when used in this article dimensional nonconformity a nonconforming situation that occurs when the height size or minimum floor space of a structure or the relationship between an existing building or buildings and other buildings or lot lines does not conform to the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located effective date of this this article refers to the effective date of this ordinance the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to this ordinance if the amendment rather than this ordinance as originally adopted creates a nonconforming situation nonconforming lot a lot existing at the effective date of this ordinance and not created for the purposes of evading the restrictions of this ordinance that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the district in which the lot is located nonconforming project any structure development or undertaking

nonconforming sign a sign see for definition that on the effective date of this ordinance does not conform to one or more of the regulations set forth in this ordinance particularly nonconforming situation a situation that occurs when on the effective date of this ordinance an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located among other possibilities a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements because the relationship between existing buildings and the land in such matters as density and setback requirements is not in conformity with this ordinance or because land or buildings are used for purposes made unlawful by this ordinance nonconforming signs shall not be regarded as nonconforming situations for purposes of this article but shall be governed by the provisions of nonconforming use a nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located for example a commercial office building in a residential district may be a nonconforming use the term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property for example all the activity

yard dimensions shall conform to the regulations for the zone in which such lot is located 2 if on the date this section becomes effective an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section this subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming the intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations 1 except as specifically provided in this section no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in a an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use or b greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements 2 a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this ordinance was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building 3 a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming viii3 4 notwithstanding any single family or duplex structure use for residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming residential use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to setback and parking requirements this paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in of this amended   5 a nonconforming structure may be altered to decrease its nonconformity 6 notwithstanding whenever 1 there exists a lot with one or more structures on it and 2 a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot and 3 the parking or loading requirements of that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation however the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with if 1 parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required  and 2 such satellite parking is reasonably available if such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special or conditionaluse permit is granted then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available this requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit

this section 2 if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed 25% of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this section this subsection does not apply to structures used for singlefamily residential purposes which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in of this for purposes of subsections 1 and 2

shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of increase in the consumer price index since the last date of valuation or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser viii4 4 the zoning administrator shall issue a permit authorized by this section if heshe finds that in completing the renovation repair or replacement work a no violation of of this occur and b the permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this ordinance applicable to the existing use except that the permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use c compliance with a requirement of this ordinance is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists 1 a change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning or specialuse permit in accordance with may not be made except in accordance with subsections 2 however this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed 2 if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this ordinance applicable to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this ordinance is achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status 3 if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this ordinance applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible if the zoning administrator issues a permit authorizing the change this permit may be issued if the zoning administrator finds in addition to any other findings that may be required by this ordinance that a the intended change will not result in a violation of of this b all of the applicable requirements of this ordinance that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with compliance with a requirement of this ordinance is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible and in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby created 4 if the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming then the change is permissible if the zoning administrator upon recommendation of the planning viii5 commission issues a permit authorizing the change the zoning administrator may issue the permit if it is found in addition to other findings that may be required by this ordinance that a the use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with a zoning or specialuse permit and b all of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in of this section are satisfied and c the proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situation 1 when a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days  the property involved shall thereafter be used only for conforming purposes with the exception of any existinf structure originally constructed as a single family detached residential house such residential structure may continue to be used as a singlefamily home until it is removed or replaced with a conforming structure amendment 82015 effective  2 if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is discontinued for a consecutive period of one year then that property shall thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the zoning administrator issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations this permit may be issued if the zoning administrator finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the approval of said permit shall not have the effect of increasing the nonconformity nor shall it have the effect of increasing the intensity of the nonconformity the permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected 3 for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for one year shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter 4 when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this ordinance is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this ordinance the oneyear period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this ordinance completion of nonconforming projects 1 construction may be begun andor completed under the terms of a building permit issued prior to the

district is to provide special regulatory protection for the land and water resources and to recognize general areas where sensitive natural features and other development constraints limit uses or where special land use development requirements are imposed for the express purpose of protecting and enhancing water quality in the chesapeake bay and its tributaries and maintaining or protecting sensitive wildlife habitats included in this classification are areas best suited for open space or low intensity recreation uses permitted development in these areas should be strictly regulated to ensure minimum adverse environmental impacts with special attention given to maintaining natural conditions floating zones 1 purpose floating zones are zones that have areas designated for them in the elkton comprehensive plan but are not mapped out in detail at the time of adoption of the most recent ix4 comprehensive revision to the elkton zoning purpose of the designated floating zones is to permit the mapping of areas for land uses that require land area over the next 20 years the designated floating zone provides a mechanism for the establishment of the district in appropriate areas limiting the areas to be zoned and setting conditions that must be met by any development proposal seeking such a designation further the procedure is twostage so that the initial costs are not prohibitive 2 designation of floating zones the following special zoning districts are designated as floating zones a reserved b planned business development district  bp c growth allocation district

conditions for future determination as the town grows and specific needs develop ix5 special overlay district  highway corridor purpose 1 the purpose of establishing this overlay district is to protect andor enhance the aesthetic and visual character of the town of elkton and to provide for and promote orderly growth of the same the overlay district regulations are intended to supplement the regulations of the underlying zoning districts and to provide for the harmony and compatibility of development along the highway corridors all development proposed within this district shall be subject to the procedures standards and guidelines specified in the following sections in addition to those standards pertaining to the particular base zoning district in which the development occurs in particular the purpose of the special overlay district is as follows a to encourage and better articulate positive visual experiences along the towns major existing and proposed highways b to provide for the continued safe and efficient use of these roadways c to maintain natural beauty and scenic cultural and historic character of the corridor particularly distinctive views vistas and visual continuity d minimize intersection and site access points these purposes will be accomplished of proposed developments within this zoning district by the planning commission which shall review the location character and appearance of new development in accordance with these regulations it is the purpose of such review to determine in a cooperative fashion with the applicant whether a proposed plan meets the guidelines and other standards of this zoning district 2 the highway corridor overlay zoning district shall include all lands within 500 feet of each side of the center line of the following rightsofway us 40 i95 md 213 and md 279 where a property along the abovementioned roadways is annexed into the town the highway corridor overlay zoning district shall be automatically extended across said property the approximate boundary of the overlay district shall be shown on the official zoning map and shall be shown as a surveyed line by the applicant on each property subject to review affected development 1 all development plan applications for development located in the highway corridor overlay district shall be reviewed by the planning commission all changes subject to approval by the commission shall receive such approval before proceeding if a portion of the corridor will not be visible from the road once the project is completed the commission may waive review of that portion 2 development activity permitted within the district a there shall be no alteration of the existing condition of the lands uses or structures within the special overlay district from the date of enactment of this section henceforth except as provided for by this section or by other sections of this the overlay district regulations are supplementary to the permitted uses and requirements for the appropriate underlying zoning district as contained in of this ordinance ix6 3 development activity prohibited within the district uses prohibited in the underlying zoning district are also prohibited in the overlay district reserved retention of andor creation of a minimum visual buffer along highway corridor rightofways 1 each approved application for development shall provide a minimum visual buffer between the rightofway line of the subject roadway and all proposed structures and parking areas the purpose of the minimum visual buffer is to soften the appearance of structures and parking lots from the road to screen vehicular headlight glare on and off site and to lessen spillover light from onsite lighting the buffer shall be continuous except as set forth in 2 below and be no less than the requirements for bufferyard b contained in appendix c depth across the existing rightofway line or from the new rightofway line should the application under consideration be required to or voluntarily provide a dedication of or easement for proposed roadway purposes the minimum bufferyard depth shall not occur at the high activity areas of a project these areas include but are not limited to building entrances dropoffs and drivethrus to determine the average depth of the minimum visual buffer measurements shall be taken at intervals not greater than ten 10 feet perpendicular to the property line side buffer areas required by other sections of this ordinance and deep narrow land areas shall not be used when calculating the minimum visual buffer where lagoons and drainage swales occur in the minimum visual buffer because of natural land forms or drainage patterns additional buffer depth and vegetation shall be required to augment the screening effect 2 the intent of the minimum visual buffer is to leave the naturally occurring buffer vegetation intact for its softening effect this buffer may be enhanced or created where such vegetation is insufficient or nonexistent with trees and shrubs of a variety of species appropriate to town character if the minimum visual buffer already has trees of protected size and species as noted in their preservation is required where masses of native shrubs are present their preservation with minimum disturbance is strongly encouraged while complete screening of a project is not required sufficient plant material shall be installed to accomplish the softening effect required in 1 above in order to maintain the screening effect existing vegetation shall not be limbedup from the ground more than five 5 feet to the lowest branches however if understory planting is planned existing vegetation may with the approval of the zoning administrator be limbedup to a height that will provide adequate sunlight to those plants minimum height and caliper of new trees shall be consistent with provisions of the tree protection requirements in of this height of new shrubs used to create the minimum visual buffer shall be three 3 feet exemptions from buffer requirements exemptions whether partial or total from the bufferyard provisions may be granted if it can be sufficiently demonstrated that such bufferyard will have a deleterious visual effect upon an existing situation or that preservation of existing tree stand or other unique natural vegetative resource particular effort on the part of a developer in protecting the existing natural environment warrants the relaxation of bufferyard requirements the following outlines those anticipated situations where the bufferyard requirement may be relaxed or removed ix7 1 protection of existing visual environment in the following cases where the characteristics of the existing visual environment would be detracted from by the provision of a required bufferyard a views and vistas of existing buildings which exhibit a high degree of aesthetic value serving to heighten the visual experience serve as important points of spatial identification contain value as important historical resources b views and vistas of existing natural landscapetopographical features of a particular locale which correspond to certain high points affording panoramic views views to settlement clusters views of water valleys and other elements of the physical landscape c views and vistas to existing recreationalopen space areas whether natural or manmade which serve to contribute to the overall visual environment uses such as golfcourses local parks cemeteries d views and vistas to which give the observer an awareness of a locations inherent character related to views of farmland pastures water activities such as docks or other maritime activities specific to the area 2 protection of proposed visual environment in the following cases where a proposed development intended to further enhance or protect the existing visual environment would be visually affected by the required bufferyard a a proposed development which by virtue of the characteristics of its structures indicates innovation of design a unique relationship with the site represents a focal point establishes a particular identifying element for the locale b a proposed development which exhibits innovative or unique uses of site landscaping or which combines in the use of the site open recreational areas such as described above 3 retention of existing natural attributes of the site in this case significant steps must be taken by a developer to preserve significant tree stands topographic characteristics even in the event that such elements are in locations where they are not wholly visible the intent is to provide incentives to retain the features of the existing natural environment rather than encourage its destruction and then to remedy the situation with new plantings 4 management of existing and proposed resources in order to encourage management programs for visual natural resources so that the continuation of such resource is assured bufferyard requirements may be reduced or waived permitted activity in minimum visual buffer before and after development 1 no existing vegetation of any type size or origin shall be altered or removed unless it satisfies the tree protection requirements of of this within the minimum visual buffer there shall be no development clearing grading or construction activity except for the following a roadway andor driveway access to the portion of the site not in the minimum visual buffer provided that it is approximately perpendicular to rightofway ix8 b provision for water sanitary sewer storm drainage electrical telephone natural gas cable etc service lines provided they are approximately perpendicular to the rightofway in the event that utilities must be installed approximately parallel to the road rightof way an equal amount of buffer may be required to substitute for the area of vegetation removal permission for easement and rightofway disturbance and clearing for such services shall be more favorably considered when such activity is consolidated with vehicular access routes c pedestrian and bicycle paths designed to provide continuous connection along the road corridor provided that they can be constructed without materially reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer d lighting fixtures only for approved signs or if for safety reasons they cannot be placed outside the buffer and then only when electric utility lines serving these fixtures and necessary easements can be established and constructed without reducing the screening and visual softening capacity of the vegetation buffer e signs in accordance with the sign regulations in reasonable effort should be made to locate all signage outside of the buffer f clear sight distances at the permitted entrances and exits to any development as needed to provide for reasonable traffic safety in accordance with accepted traffic engineering practices g the addition of plantings earth forms or other visual buffers that in the opinion of the commission would better achieve the purpose set out in appendices b and c than would otherwise be the case architectural review 1 guidelines the compatible relationship of architecture along highway corridors is of public concern the intent of the architectural review is not to stifle innovative architectural design but to assure respect for and reduce incompatible and adverse impacts on the visual experience from the roadway to accomplish this the planning commission shall use the following guidelines in reviewing proposed structures site improvements signs and streetscape improvements within the highway corridor overlay zone a proposed development shall avoid excessive or unsightly grading indiscriminate earth moving or clearing of property and removal of trees and vegetation that could cause disruption of natural water courses or disfigure natural land forms b proposed

connection with a particular use in the table of permissible uses the letter pc means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the administrator provided the conditions stipulated in are met the letters sc mean the conditions of approval stipulated in for the proposed use must be met and a special exception permit must be obtained from the board of zoning appeals the letters se mean a special exception permit must be obtained from the board of zoning appeals board of appeals jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible with a zoning permit notwithstanding any other provisions of this article whenever the table of permissible uses interpreted in the light of the applicable provisions contained in this article provides that a use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permissible with a zoning permit a specialexception permit shall nevertheless be required if the administrator finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public in making this determination the administrator shall consider among other factors whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question permissible uses and specific exclusions 1 the presumption established by this zoning ordinance is that all legitimate uses of land in the town are provided for within at least one zoning district in the towns planning jurisdiction because the list of permissible uses set forth in the table of permissible uses cannot be all inclusive those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses 2 notwithstanding all uses that are not listed in the table of permissible uses even given the liberal interpretation mandated by are prohibited nor shall the table of permissible uses be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in other zoning districts 3 no building or tract of land shall be devoted to any use other than a use permitted hereinafter in the zoning district

total activity that takes place on a lot or 2 is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a swimming pooltennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed apart from a residential development would require a

requirements for the overall use are altered c if the original use is a combination use or planned unit development use the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or planned unit development use changes d if the original use is a planned residential development the relative proportions of different types of dwelling units change e if there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination use that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type of business for example if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within the same principal use classification however if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed moreover if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot shopping centercombination use has not changed 2 a mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned 3 a mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use combination uses 1 when a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits zoning or specialexception then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be a a specialexception permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a specialexception permit b a zoning permit in all other cases x4 2 when a combination use consists of a singlefamily detached residential subdivision that is not a twofamily or multifamily use the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by having the developer indicate on the plans the portion of the total lot that will be developed for each purpose and calculating the density for each portion as if it were a separate lot 3 when a combination use consists of a singlefamily detached and twofamily or multifamily uses then the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by dividing the area of the tract by the minimum square footage per dwelling unit specified in permissible uses tables 1 more specific use controls whenever a development could fall within a more than

other factors the underlying objectives of this article may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision therefore the planning commission may permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that 1 the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them  and 2 because of peculiarities in the developers tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to require strict adherence to these standards 2 whenever the planning commission authorizes some deviation from the standards set forth in this article pursuant to the official record of action taken on the development shall contain a statement of reasons for allowing the deviation reserved xv1 article xv utilities utility

town of elkton shall be furnished in accordance with the requirements set forth in of this ordinance xviii1 article xviii screening shading forest conservation and environmental standards buffers purpose 1 one of zonings most important functions is the division of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses all uses permitted in any district have generally similar nuisance characteristics bufferyards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses 2 the bufferyard is a combination of setback and a visual buffer or barrier and is a yard or area together with the planting required thereon both the amount of land and the type and amount of planting specified for each bufferyard requirement of this specified and are designed to ameliorate nuisances between adjacent zoning districts to ensure a desired character along public streets and roads the planting units required of bufferyards have been calculated to ensure that they do in fact function as buffers 3 bufferyards shall be required to separate different zoning districts from each other in order to eliminate or minimize potential nuisances such as dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and unsightly buildings or parking areas or to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise odor or danger from fires or explosions mature woodlands are considered the best buffers and should be used whenever possible location of bufferyards bufferyards shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel extending to the lot or parcel boundary line bufferyards shall not be located on any portion of an existing or dedicated public or private street or rightofway bufferyards shall not be located within a yard required in a single family attached townhouse development or planned unit development determination of required bufferyard to determine the type of bufferyard required on a parcel or between two parcels or between a parcel and a street the following procedure shall be used 1 identify whether any portion or property line of the site constitutes a zoning district boundary if it does determine the zoning on both sides of the property 2 determine whether the land on the adjoining property is vacant or developed or whether a plat of the subdivision has been approved 3 classify any street adjacent to the proposed use as a local collector or arterial street 4 determine the bufferyard required on each boundary or segment thereof of the subject parcel by referring to the tables of required bufferyards 5 determine if the proposed development is a use which has bufferyards required to separate that use from certain uses then determine the bufferyard required between such uses by referring to the tables of required bufferyards xviii2 responsibility for bufferyards 1 when a proposed use adjoins a vacant parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the presence of a zoning boundary that use shall at the time of development provide onehalf 05 of the buffer which is required by the tables of required bufferyards 2 the second use to develop shall at the time it develops provide all additional plant material andor land necessary to provide the total bufferyard required between those two 2 uses if the adjoining use had developed without a bufferyard the second use will be responsible for installing the total bufferyard 3 existing plant material andor land located on the preexisting first developed land use which meets the requirements of this be counted as contributing to the total bufferyard required between it and the second adjacent land use to develop tables of required bufferyards required bufferyards between adjacent zoning districts zone rp r1 r2 r3 tc ro c1 c2 c3 bi pud bp rp  b b

bufferyards for the purposes of this  bufferyards which exceed minimum requirements where the bufferyard required between a land use and vacant land turns out to be greater than that bufferyard which is required between the first use and the subsequently developed use the following options apply 1 the subsequent use may provide one half 05 of the buffer required by this existing use may expand its use into the original buffer area provided that the resulting total bufferyard between the two uses meets the bufferyard requirements of this the existing use may enter into agreements with abutting landowners to use its existing buffer to provide some or all of the required bufferyard of both land uses the total buffer shall equal the requirements of this that such an agreement can be negotiated the initial use may provide the second use some or all of its required bufferyard andor extra land on which it might develop the existing use may reduce its excess buffer by transferring part or all of the excess buffer to the adjoining landowner to serve as its buffer any remaining excess buffer area may be used by the existing use for xviii4 expansion of that use or for transfer by it to the adjoining landowner to expand that adjoining use 3 any such arrangement as defined in above shall be clearly indicated on a site plan and shall be accompanied by legal documents as may be required by the planning commission contractual reduction of bufferyards when a land use is proposed adjacent to vacant land and the owner of that vacant land enters into a contractual relationship with the owner of the land that is to be developed first a reduced buffer may be provided by that first use provided that the contract contains a statement by the owner of the vacant land of an intent to develop at no greater than a specified land use intensity class  and an agreement by that vacant landowner to assume all responsibility for additional buffer if needed by the subsequent development of a less intense use than had been agreed upon is transferred to the owner of the vacant second in time to be developed land any such arrangement to reduce bufferyards as described above shall be clearly indicated on a site plan and shall be accompanied by legal documents as may be required by the planning commission financial surety and maintenance of bufferyards 1 the requirements for posting a financial surety and the procedures for partial release and final release of financial sureties for bufferyards shall be the same as for afforestation or reforestation as defined in of this the requirement to install bufferyards as defined in this section is an integral part of the implementation of this the comprehensive plan continued maintenance of the bufferyards is essential in assuring that the intent of this continually met once the financial surety has been released failure to properly maintain the bufferyard shall be deemed a violation per of this ii shading town findings and declaration of policy shade trees 1 the town finds that a trees are proven producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival b trees appreciably reduce the ever increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe c trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the airwasher devices used on commercial air conditioning systems d trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers xviii5 e trees root systems stabilize the ground water tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control f trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land particularly parking areas and g for the reasons indicated herein trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values 2 based upon the findings set forth in the town declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health safety and welfare of all persons living or working within the towns planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and under the circumstances set forth in this article to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments required trees along dedicated streets along both sides of all newly created streets that are constructed in accordance with the elkton street standards the developer shall at a minimum either plant or retain sufficient trees so that between the paved portion of the street and a line running parallel to and fifty 50 feet from the centerline of the street there is for every thirtyfive 35 feet of street frontage at least an average of one deciduous tree that has or will have when fully mature a trunk at least twelve 12 inches in diameter when trees are planted by the developer pursuant to this section the developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in appendix b tree protection the following regulations supplement but do not supersede the forest conservation by the town of elkton on  and as amended see  1 development of land for different uses and intensity of uses will often times necessitate the removal of trees to accommodate roads parking buildings and facilities it is the expressed intent of this ordinance that every effort be made design layout and construction of development projects to incorporate and save as many trees as possible 2 no person shall cut destroy move or remove any living diseasefree tree of any species having a trunk with a diameter of eight 8 inches or larger in conjunction with any development of land governed by this ordinance unless and until such removal or destruction has been approved under the provisions of this ordinance trunk diameter is measured 45 feet above the ground and is referred to as diameter breast height dbh 3 no person shall cut or clear land of trees for the sole purpose of offering land for sale 4 the clearcutting of trees is prohibited the term clearcutting as used herein shall mean the cutting of more than 75 percent of the trees six inches in trunk diameter or larger clearcutting pursuant to an approved development plan shall require the planting xviii6 of replacement trees as indicated in the detailed landscape plan accompanying the development application 5 a survey of all trees of applicable size shall be made and submitted in conjunction with the development site layout all trees proposed for removal shall be clearly noted the tree survey shall be certified by either a registered land surveyor registered engineer or registered landscape architect 6 the requirement for a tree survey is waived in the case of golf course construction or when preliminary site evaluation reveals the ability to accomplish the proposed project without removal of any trees eight 8 inches in diameter or larger in the latter case the applicant shall submit a written statement that no trees will be removed and his permit will indicate no tree removal as a condition thereof 7 removal of endangered or valued trees will not normally be permitted trees included in this category are  american elm ulmus americana  american holly ilex opaca  bald cypress taxodium distichum  pecan carya illinoensis  southern magnolia magnolia grandflora  american chestnut castanea dentata 8 considerable damage to or the death of trees may result if more than six 6 inches of soil is added around the base of a tree more than 30 percent of circumferential bark is removed or more than 30 percent of the root system is removed in addition asphalt paving building construction and soil compaction too close to trees may cause their destruction accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the developer to institute alternative site designs to assure the best chance of tree survival whenever these criteria cannot be adhered to 9 those trees designated for preservation in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance as shown on the approved landscape plan shall be marked with bright blue ribbons encircling the tree trunk at a height of four 4 feet above the ground and a four 4foot high barricade will be constructed around the tree at the drip line prior to the start of construction 10 as a condition of approval under this ordinance the applicant may be required to plant replacement trees for trees approved for removal as part of the final plan in requiring replacement trees the following will be considered a the intended use of the property  b the existing or predevelopment tree coverage sizes and types  c the number size type and location of natural trees proposed for preservation by the applicant  d the grading road building parking and drainage requirements xviii7 e conformance with other provisions of this  retention and protection of large trees 1 every development shall retain all existing trees eighteen 18 inches in diameter or more unless the retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development 2 no excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the drip line of any tree eighteen 18 inches in diameter or more and no impervious surface including but not limited to paving or buildings may be located within twelve and onehalf 12  feet measured from the center of the trunk of any tree eighteen 18 inches in diameter or more unless compliance with this subsection would unreasonably burden the development for purposes of this subsection a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground 3 the retention or protection of trees eighteen 18 inches in diameter or more as provided in subsections 1 and 2 unreasonably burdens a developer if to accomplish such retention or protection the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer 4 if space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of subsections 1 or 2 and as a result the parking requirements set forth in cannot be satisfied the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces lost because of the provisions of subsections 1 and 2 up to a maximum of fifteen 15 percent of the required spaces shade trees in parking areas 1 vehicle accommodation areas that are required to be paved must be shaded by deciduous trees either retained or planted by the developer that have or will have when fully mature a trunk at least twelve 12 inches in diameter when trees are planted by the developer to satisfy the requirements of this subsection the developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in appendix b 2 each tree of the type described in shall be presumed to shade a circular area having a radius of fifteen 15 feet with the trunk of the tree as the center and there must be sufficient trees so that using this standard twenty 20 percent of the vehicle accommodation area will be shaded 3 no paving may be placed within twelve and onehalf feet 12  feet measured from the center of the trunk of any tree retained to comply with new trees planted to comply with shall be located so that they are surrounded by at least 200 square feet of unpaved area 4 vehicle accommodation areas shall be laid out and
