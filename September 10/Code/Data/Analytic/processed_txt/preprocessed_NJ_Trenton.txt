responsibility  see ch 180  581 findings and purpose a the city council of the city of trenton hereby finds there has been a significant breakdown in the supervision normally provided by certain parents and guardians for juveniles under 18 years of age resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior including vandalism noise and rowdy behavior breaking and entering public drinking and littering and harassment of residents b the new jersey legislature recently enacted pl 199 which authorizes municipalities to adopt ordinances regulating the presence of minors in public places between the hours of  pm and  am the mayor and city council concur with the sentiments of the new jersey legislature that regulation of a minors access to public places during those stated hours is in the mutual best interests of the minor and society at large c the city council further finds that the offensive activities of the juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances because the activities are easily concealed whenever police officers are present and that the establishment of reasonable curfew regulations will enable the community to better control the free and unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles d the city council further finds and has determined that a curfew meets a very real local need and that curfew ordinances in other communities have been a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency a curfew in trenton is particularly appropriate in view of the basic residential nature of the community and the sense of the community that there is a proper time for the cessation of outdoor activities of juveniles that sense of the community is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this chapter which takes into consideration also the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of juveniles with potential risks incident to immaturity e the city council further finds that the community is not overcrowded and that there has been a decrease in the school population over the past years commercial recreational facilities are limited and there is  5713 curfew  581   582 definitions for the purposes of this chapter the following terms phrases words and their derivations shall have the meaning given herein age  years of age continues from one birthday to but not including the day of the next such that a person who has not completed

thought with additional precision and precaution numerous exceptions are expressly defined in this chapter so that this is not a mere prohibitory or presencetype curfew more and more exceptions become available with increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation street  a way or place of whatsoever nature open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case little or nothing for juveniles to do outdoors but roam the streets after the curfew hours which this chapter establishes f trenton is basically a family community parent responsibilities for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm by a substantial majority of the community legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness in many communities over the years the city council has determined that as parental control increases there is a likelihood that juvenile delinquency decreases that there is a need for a nocturnal curfew for juveniles in trenton and that the establishment of a curfew applicable to juveniles will reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of parents and guardians

behalf of a parent or guardian assume the responsibility of caring for the juvenile pending the availability or arrival of a parent or guardian d notification of parent  questioning of juvenile if a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is on the streets in violation of this chapter the officer shall notify the juvenile that she is in violation of this chapter and shall require the

recognizes a constitutional right to beg or solicit in a peaceful and nonthreatening manner the city council finds however that an increase in aggressive solicitation throughout the city has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places but also to an enhanced sense of fear intimidation and disorder b aggressive panhandling usually includes approaching or following pedestrians the use of abusive language unwanted physical contact or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic the city council further finds that the presence of individuals who solicit money from persons at or near banks or automated teller machines is especially troublesome motorists also find themselves confronted by persons who without permission wash their automobile windows at traffic intersections despite explicit indications by drivers not to do so such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property people driving or parking on city streets frequently find themselves faced with panhandlers seeking money by offering to perform services such as opening car doors or locating parking spaces c this article is timely and appropriate because current laws and city regulations are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems the restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest furthermore in enacting this legislation the city council recognizes the availability of community service and other sentencing alternatives which may be appropriate remedies for violations of this article d this article is not enhanced to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to solicit funds picket protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity its goal instead is to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of solicitation that have become an unwelcome and overwhelming presence in the city  20110 peace and good order  20111  aggressive manner  ask  see beg automated teller

provision of this section and such procedural regulations as may be adopted by the board a landlord may receive an increase exceeding the limitation of  2226 above in the rent of any dwelling unit

the board to permit an increase in rent by an amount exceeding all other limitations imposed hereby upon one or more of the following grounds increase permissible under this section shall be computed in the following manner 1 where the increase applies to a single unit or where all of the units to which the increase applies contain the same number of bedrooms the increase shall be applied as in  2227 2 where the increase applies to a building containing more than one unit and where units in such building contain different numbers of bedrooms the landlord shall total the number of bedrooms in the building and divide the number of bedrooms in each unit by that total in order to obtain the pro rata share for each unit the landlord shall allocate the increase calculated as in  2227 among the units in the building according to the pro rata share of each as so determined b no sewer or water charge increase under this section may take effect until or unless the landlord has documented the increase on a form which the board shall prescribe and make available a copy of which form shall be completed in full and filed with the board and copies served on all tenants affected by the increase prior to the effective date of the increase a present rents are insufficient to enable the landlord to maintain the dwelling unit in conformity with local or state housing codes or other appropriate legal requirements  provided however that no such increase shall be approved in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that despite diligent efforts and reasonable measures to economize within financial constraints affecting the operation and management of the dwelling the necessary funding cannot be provided without resort to a rental increase b present rents are insufficient to enable the landlord to satisfy reasonable mortgage or other normal and customary financial obligations directly related to the normal maintenance and operation of the dwelling  provided however that on the basis of the same proofs that are required under above as well as documentation of the particular financing provisions underlying the petition and that an increase under this shall only be approved where the board finds that resort to rental increases is necessary to prevent a default in such obligations entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of qualifying for an increase hereunder the applicant for an increase under this section shall further have the burden of showing that the purchase price mortgage terms and other financial obligations which form the basis for the request for an increase in rent are  2229 rent control  22210  1 consistent with market conditions in effect at present or at the time in which the obligation was incurred 2 consistent with customary financial practice with respect to obligations of the nature incurred 3 represent a reasonable and prudent undertaking in light of all relevant factors c the landlord has made or proposes to make capital improvements or service improvements to the dwelling which directly or indirectly have or will have a substantial effect upon the dwelling unit for which the increase is sought the landlord shall compute the average cost of the improvement per year of useful life by dividing the cost of the completed capital improvement by the number of years of useful life of the improvement as claimed by the landlord for income tax depreciation purposes the amount of the monthly increase which a landlord may charge shall be prorated among all tenants benefiting from such improvement by dividing 112 of the annual cost of the capital improvement by the total rent roll of the units affected by the improvement in the dwelling occupied or unoccupied no tenant who receives no benefit from the improvement shall be liable for a capital improvement increase and no tenant who benefits from an improvement shall be liable for an increase exceeding the percentage of rent paid by himher as calculated above and all such rent increases shall be charged for no period greater than the depreciation period of such improvements the landlord shall notify the tenants at least 60 days before the effective date of the increase the notice shall include the amount of increase the tenant may request a hearing within 30 days of receipt of notice from the landlord any increase may be approved prior to improvements being made but the increase shall not take effect until after the improvements have been completed d any substantial hardship created by circumstances beyond the control of the landlord or hisher agent which arose or substantially changed during the term of the lease or period of tenancy under which the present rent is fixed e as a result of the landlords past failure to impose the rent increases permitted under  2226 the rent is now significantly below prevailing market rents for units of comparable size and location where the board finds that such is the case the landlord shall compute the maximum rent that would be in effect if all increases had been made as permitted under  2226 and shall submit documentation of the base rent used for purposes of this showing and the calculations made to determine the maximum rent that would be in effect at the time of the petition where the board finds that such documentation is in order it shall permit maximum rent provided that

from three to five visitors to the downtown therefore in addition to breaking up pedestrian flow and increasing the number of pedestrian and vehicle conflicts the introduction of curb cuts for driveways diminishes a city asset and displaces three to five visitors who must seek an alternative parking accommodation  for these reasons where there is onstreet parking on a street in the downtown the introduction of curb cuts for driveways should be limited and located to minimize their impact to available onstreet parking  for each district the minimum required offstreet parking creation per curb cut is identified the applicant will be required to demonstrate that it has provided the designated number of offstreet spaces to replace each onstreet space that is removed because of the
