sanitation thirteen planning and zoning fifteen  fire prevention seventeen  building and housing s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes chapters articles and sections are based on an adaption of the decimal numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is self identifying as to code article and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the article number is 305 or the 5th article within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and article numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the article number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the article number is 113 or the 13th article within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes chapters and articles initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation articles are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position

pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the utility manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with b1e and f bwhen the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the utility manager may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the utility manager shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e da ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of subsection b1d2 hereof 2criteria aeither ithe applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or iithe industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters bcredit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere ccredit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result ewhen a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the utility manager the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsection b1e1a hereof 1to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must aemploy or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  bcurrently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  cprovide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the long term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  dnot have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and ehave consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must amaintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  bcontinue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  ccontinue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the utility manager whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent 20% from its baseline production rates determined in subsection b1e1c hereof upon notification of a revised production rate the utility manager will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and dcontinue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant subsection b1e1a hereof so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3when developing equivalent mass limits the utility manager awill calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  bupon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and cmay retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection c5hereof f the utility manager may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the utility manager when converting such limits to concentration limits the utility manager will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by subsection c5 hereof see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the utility manager will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 g once included in its

such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation i any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the utility manager within two 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to

services  and growing areas of declining property values crime and poverty the resultant loss of community identity adds to these problems by discouraging citizen awareness of and participation in community affairs under this model a majority of a municipalitys time and money is spent replacing and extending infrastructure and mitigating the negative impacts of development assessed on a projectbyproject basis the total effects and subsequent costs are hidden by immediate tax base increases and owner profits however if assessed at the community level long term all additional development of the model described above becomes a burden on a community lowdensity development increases the cost of living in order to finance maintain and replace infrastructure eventually the increased cost of building and living in such areas prevents growth from continuing this occurs long before an area reaches full economic potential and physical build out a development model which addresses these problems must treat a community as a highly complex entity not merely as a collection of individual market segments or an opportunity for real estate speculation the most basic viable unit of our complex economic region is the neighborhood neighborhoods provide the daily essential needs of all its residents in an area that is easily definable and pedestrian friendly neighborhoods interconnect to form town centers traditionally commercial development respected this neighborhood scale and therefore integrated itself into the fabric of the neighborhood building design and its center this the return to traditional and sustainable planning it differs from conventional planning because it focuses on physical change of the urban environment traditional design elements of town making  public space infrastructure buildings and parks it combines these elements to construct places beyond the autonomy of the individual project interest or property 1 the city a the city of fairmont is a finite place with specifically designated geographic boundaries the city is comprised of multiple community centers some with their own identifiable center and edges derived from topography and rivers or streams these community centers should form a fundamental economic unit of the contemporary world governmental cooperation public policy physical planning and economic strategies must foster and promote the development and redevelopment of these identifiable community centers b the city also has a necessary and fragile relationship with the outlaying rural unincorporated areas of marion county and the natural landscape this relationship is environmental economic and cultural farmland and nature are as important to the city as the garden is to the house c development and redevelopment patterns should not blur or eradicate the edges of the city infill development redevelopment reuse and preservation of green spaces within the city all conserve environmental resources economic investment and social fabric while reclaiming redeveloping and revitalizing marginal and abandoned areas the city should develop strategies to encourage such infill development redevelopment reuse and preservation over peripheral expansion d where appropriate new development with the city should be organized as neighborhoods and districts and be integrated with the existing urban pattern development and redevelopment should respect historical patterns precedents and boundaries e the city should bring into proximity a broad spectrum of public and private uses to support an economy that benefits people of all incomes affordable housing should be distributed throughout the city to match job opportunities and to avoid concentrations of poverty f the physical organization of the city should be supported by a framework of transportation alternatives transit pedestrian and bicycle systems should maximize access and mobility throughout the city while reducing

form identifiable areas that encourage citizens to take responsibility for their maintenance and evolution b neighborhoods should be compact pedestrianfriendly and mixeduse districts generally emphasize a special single use and should follow the principles of neighborhood design when possible corridors are regional connectors of neighborhoods and districts  they range from boulevards and rail lines to rivers and parkways c many activities of daily living should occur within walking distance allowing independence to those who do not drive especially the elderly and the young interconnected networks of streets should be designed to encourage walking reduce the number and length of automobile trips and conserve energy d within neighborhoods a broad range of housing types and price levels can bring people of diverse ages races and incomes into daily interaction strengthening the personal and civic bonds essential to an authentic community e transit corridors when properly planned and coordinated can help organize municipal structure and revitalize the municipalitys community centers in contrast highway corridors should not displace investment from the municipalitys existing community centers f appropriate building densities and land uses should be within walking distance of transit stops permitting public transit to become a viable alternative to the automobile g concentrations of civic institutional and commercial activity should be embedded in neighborhoods and districts not isolated in remote singleuse complexes schools when possible and economically feasible should be sized and located to enable children to walk or bicycle to them h the economic health and harmonious evolution of neighborhoods districts and corridors can be improved

streets and public spaces as places of shared use b individual architectural projects should be seamlessly linked to their surroundings c the revitalization of urban places depends on safety and

automobiles it should do so in ways that respect the pedestrian and the form of public space e streets and squares should be safe comfortable and interesting to the pedestrian properly configured they encourage walking and enable neighbors to know each other and protect their communities f architecture and landscape design should grow from local climate topography history and building practice g
