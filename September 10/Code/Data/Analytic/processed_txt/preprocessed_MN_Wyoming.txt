which operate as massage parlors saunas and similar adultoriented services operating under different names in order to protect the public health safety and welfare and to guard against the inception and transmission of disease the council further finds that commercial enterprises such as the type described above and all other similar establishments whose services include sessions offered to adults conducted in private by members of the same or the opposite sex and employing personnel with no specialized training are susceptible to operation in a manner contravening subverting or endangering the morals of the community by being the site of acts of prostitution illicit sex and occasions of violent crimes thus requiring close inspection licensing and regulation b the council also finds that control and regulation of commercial establishments of these types in view of the abuses often perpetrated require intensive efforts by the police department public health sanitarian and other departments of the city as a consequence the concentrated use of city services in such control detracts from and reduces the level of service available to the rest of the community and thereby diminishes the ability of the city to promote the general health welfare and safety of the community in consideration for the necessity on the part of the city to provide numerous services to all segments of the community without a concentration of public services in one area working to the detriment of the members of the general public the number of sauna and massage parlor licenses which

the health safety and welfare of the residents of wyoming and persons visiting or working in wyoming city that the character and quality of the environment to be considered to be of major importance in the planning and development of the city in this regard the manner in which land is developed and used is of high priority the preservation of land for park playground trail and public open space purposes as it relates to the use and development of land for residential and commercialindustrial purposes is essential to the maintaining of a healthful and desirable environment for all citizens of the city the city must not only provide these necessary amenities for our citizens today but also be insightful to the needs of our future citizens it is recognized by the city council that the demand for parks playgrounds trails and public open space within a municipality is directly related to the density and intensity of development permitted and allowed within any given area urban type developments mean greater numbers of people and higher demands for park playground and public open space to disregard this principle is to inevitably overburden existing facilities and thus diminish the quality of the environment for all the city comprehensive plan has established minimum community criteria for meeting the needs of the residents of the city of wyoming it is the policy of the city of wyoming that the following standards and guidelines for the dedication of land or contribution of cash for park playground trail and public open space purposes in the subdividing and developing of land within the city shall be related to the density of development  parkland dedication whenever any land is being developed in wyoming under the provisions of this subdivision the developer shall be required to dedicate a portion of the land in the proposed subdivision for park playground trail public open space or cash in lieu of land as authorized in state statute  subd 2b as amended  residential platted subdivisions the amount of land to be dedicated by a subdivider for residential development shall be based on the gross area of the proposed subdivision the amount of cash in lieu of land dedication to be contributed by a subdivider for residential development shall be based upon the fair market value of the raw undeveloped land or at a minimum based upon the actual proposed density determined by the number of building lots or the number of dwelling units for the purpose of relating park dedication requirements to the density of development the following densityrate

land shall be determined as listed below when an agreement is reached which is acceptable to the subdivider and city council no further procedures on the list need be pursued a the joint park planning board and the subdivider may agree upon a recommendation to the city council as to the fair market value b the fair market value may be determined by obtaining the most recent property tax statements for the property due consideration must be given to cases where the proposed development and the tax statements are not exactly the same parcel and where only part of a tax statement parcel is being subdivided but the two parts are not of equal value per acre c the subdivider may present to the joint park planning board acceptable purchase agreements transaction records or other pertinent documents to assist in establishing the fair market value d a land appraisal may be undertaken by a firm acceptable to both the developer and the city council with said appraisal of the property may be accepted by the city council at their discretion 3 combination of land dedication and cash contribution in cases where a combination of land and cash is required the following procedure shall be used to determine the amount of cash to be contributed a if the percent required by the densityrate schedule is dedicated as land this represents a one hundred percent 100% land contribution b if the percent based on the fair market value required by the densityrate schedule is dedicated as cash this represents a one hundred percent 100% cash contribution c the current park fee times the number of building lots or number of dwelling units represents a onehundred percent 100% cash contribution d the cash contribution will be prorated so the total contribution of land and cash equals a one hundred percent 100% contribution 4 the city council upon review and recommendation of the joint park planning board shall determine by ordinance the minimum park fee per residential unit in appendix

require that a sufficient surety be posted and payable to the city for use in correcting problems on public or private lands caused by erosion and runoff from the development during the construction phase such surety shall be maintained until completion of the development or until vegetative cover has been reestablished and other measures have been taken to protect the development site to the approximate extent existing before vegetation removal land shaping and improvement construction were commenced 5 plans for surface water runoff and drainage shall be required and reviewed by the city

date this passed and adopted but shall not be modified expanded enlarged or reerected a permit is required for each existing sign as applicable under this  752 electrically energized animated signs or dynamic signs findings studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of roadway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character spacing requirements enforced by the city interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included without those requirements however there is the potential for multiple dynamic displays to exist along a corridor if more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a corridor the minimum display time becomes critical if the display time is too short a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement this impact would be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs if dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each signs ability to change frequently drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload additionally a constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination changing messages could detract from this wayfinding purpose and adversely affect driving conduct second lane changes stops or turns which could result in traffic accidents accordingly dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign 467 the city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety 1 permitted signs dynamic displays permitted in the c cbd i and ohc districts  and

information shall be reviewed with the employee specifying the following the cause for discipline the specific reasons supporting the cause the discipline to be imposed the effective date and the right of the employee to be heard employees may be disciplined for areas which include but are not limited to those detailed in the policy on employee conduct 498 the degree of discipline administered will depend on the severity of the infraction and shall be in accordance with any applicable labor contract city policies and procedures as well as local state or federal laws and regulations it is the responsibility of each supervisor and department head to evaluate thoroughly the circumstances and facts as objectively as possible and then apply the most suitable form of discipline types of disciplinary action may include step 1 oral warning  this type of discipline should be applied to infractions of a relatively minor degree or in situations where the employees performance needs to be discussed the oral warning should be given in private supervisors should inform the employee that the supervisor is issuing an oral warning that the employee is being given an opportunity to correct the condition and if the condition is not corrected the person will be subject to more severe disciplinary action a notation that an oral warning was given should be made in the employees personnel file step 2 written warningreprimand  this notice will be issued in the event the employee continues to disregard an oral warning or if the infraction is severe enough to warrant a written reprimand in the employees personnel file written warningreprimand notices should be issued within a reasonable time after the occurrence of the violation becomes known to the supervisor the warningreprimand shall state the nature of the infraction in detail and what corrective action must be taken by the employee to avoid further discipline as outlined in steps 3 4 and 5 a copy of the written warningreprimand is to be handed to the employee at the time of the discussion of the discipline the employee shall sign the written warning to acknowledge receipt a copy signed by the employee will be placed in the employees personnel file if the employee refuses to sign the acknowledgment then the supervisor and one other witness shall note on the reprimand that the employee received a copy thereof and refused to sign it step 3 suspension  this form of discipline is administered as a result of a severe infraction of policies or for repeated violation for minor infractions a suspension is often given after the employee has received a written warning suspension without pay  an employee will be suspended without pay when the offense is of a serious enough nature usually sufficient for discharge but when circumstances related to an employees overall performance would not warrant immediate discharge the length of suspensions should not normally exceed fifteen 15 work days investigatory suspensions may be used in cases where it is necessary to investigate a situation to determine what further disciplinary action may be justified this suspension gives the supervisor the opportunity to discuss the problem with hisher superior to determine an appropriate course of action when the situation is serious enough for the employee to be removed from the work environment if after investigation it is determined that the employee was not guilty of any violation heshe will normally be returned to hisher position paid for any lost time and a letter exonerating the employee will be placed in hisher official personnel file if however the employee is found in violation then the appropriate disciplinary action will take effect on the date that the investigatory suspension began suspension with pay  at the discretion of the city administrator or hisher designee an employee of the city may be suspended with pay and benefits pending investigation of allegations of misconduct when the nature of the allegation compromises the ability of the employee to perform hisher duties and when a substantial period of time will be required to complete an investigation or legal action such suspension is not a disciplinary action and may not be appealed if the charges are substantiated disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with the nature of the offense and may include recovery of salary and benefits paid during the suspension if the charges are unfounded the employee will be restored to duty and a letter of exoneration will be placed in the employees official personnel file step 4 demotion  demotion may be used in those instances where an employee has been promoted to a position where they are unwilling or unable to perform the responsibilities of that position demotion is not to be used as a substitute for dismissal when dismissal is warranted step 5 discharge  immediate removal of an employee from the job site pending review for discharge may be warranted in instances involving serious insubordination theft serious illegal or destructive acts while on the job or other substantial reasons deemed appropriate by the city administrator an employee may also be discharged after repeated offenses of a less serious nature if the offenses have been documented by the supervisor and appropriate behavioral changes have not resulted from previous progressive disciplinary action probationary employees may be terminated at any time without cause and without the right of appeal notification of dismissal in writing shall be provided the

the original manual are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions the absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original manual obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation for stylistic purposes headings and catchlines have been made uniform and the same style of citation to state statutes and expression of numbers in text as appears in the ordinances has been used the terms clerk and administrator have been changed to city clerkadministrator without notation to conform to the body of the i general assessment policies ii definitions iii assessment policy for new developments iv sanitary sewer improvements v water improvements vi storm sewer improvements vii street improvements appendix 529 i general assessment policies the purpose of this assessment manual is to set forth a guide to be utilized by the city council of the city of wyoming when determining assessments for public improvements preparing assessment rolls and other matters related to assessing some or all of the cost of such public improvements against benefited properties so as to assure uniform and consistent treatment of the affected properties minnesota statutes   to  provides that a municipality shall have the power to make public improvements such as sanitary sewers storm sewers water source and distribution facilities street improvements including grading curb and gutter surfacing sidewalks street lighting and recreational facilities etc the various procedures that the municipality must follow including reports notices and public hearings are set forth or derived from minnesota statutes the statutes the statute further provides that the cost of any improvement may be assessed upon property benefited by the improvement based upon the benefits received whether or not the property abuts on the improvement and whether or not any part of the cost of the improvement is paid from other funding sources the law is not specific on how these benefits are to be measured or how the costs are to be apportioned but rather makes it incumbent upon the municipality to determine with assistance of the city engineer city attorney appraisers or other qualified personnel a fair and equitable method of cost sharing among the properties involved throughout this manual the total cost of an improvement shall include the construction cost plus all associated overhead costs the total cost of the associated overhead for a public improvement project would typically include the following as an estimated percentage of the construction cost engineering 170% city administration 25% legal 20% fiscal 30% interest during construction 45% assessment roll preparation 20% contingencies 40% total 350% these overhead costs are estimates only the actual costs incurred will be tracked and charged to the project any contributing funds from outside sources may be deducted from the total improvement cost to determine the assessable costs the initiation of public improvement projects may happen in two different methods the first method is by a petition of the affected property owners the petition must be signed by the owners of not less than 35 percent of the frontage of the real property abutting the proposed improvements the second method is to initiate the proceedings by city council direction in which case no petition is needed an outline of the public improvement process is provided in the appendix any reference to land zoning in this manual shall mean the most current approved city zoning map available at the time it should be emphasized that the special assessment methods and policies summarized herein cannot be considered as allinclusive and that unusual circumstances may at times justify special consideration also any fixed cost data and rates presented herein will be adjusted from time to time so as to reflect current costs the city council shall retain the right to review each project on its own merit and to deviate from any portion of this assessment manual as it deems proper these deviations may occur in unique situations or where application of the policy produces unfair or undesirable results the council shall adopt findings of fact wherever possible to outline these unique situations ii definitions a assessment units the following definitions refer to the assessment units to be used when determining various assessment rates as described in the remaining sections of this manual 1 lot unit a lot unit is defined as a lot of record equivalent to a singlefamily residential lot which in accordance with wyoming zoning and subdivision regulations cannot be further subdivided 2 equivalent lot unit equivalent lot units are determined by dividing a large or unplatted parcel of land into smaller lot units the division of land for assessment purposes is done in a manner consistent with the citys current zoning for the area and subdivision regulations questions pertaining to the buildability of areas to be divided into equivalent lot units are addressed by city staff at the time of the determination 3 gross area the total area in acres or square feet of a lot or parcel of land including any easements 4 weighted areas 530 for the purpose of storm sewer assessments the weighting of areas shall be based on zoning as follows residential rr r1 and r2 100 residential r3 125 central business cbd 150 general business g 150 light industrial l 200 industrial i 200 hospital h 200 government govt 200 5 calculation of adjusted front footage a single frontage platted areas the front footage for purposes of front footage assessments shall be determined at the building set back line as described in the wyoming zoning city the city of wyoming and shall be measured parallel to the property line abutting the improvement in unplatted areas the city council shall establish on a casebycase basis a formula for determining the assessable front footage for each improvement project typically this will be accomplished by dividing the property into equivalent lot units the total parcel front footage shall then be determined by summing the front footage for each equivalent lot unit b corner the case of a street improvement project which abuts both sides of a corner lot the front footage shall be the dimension of the shorter side plus one third of the dimension of the longer side as measured according to a where the proposed improvement project is only along one side of a corner lot the front footage established for that side shall be used the maximum amount that a corner lot can be assessed for street improvements is equal to the dimension of the shorter side plus onethird of the longer side or the longer side whichever is greater within a fiveyear period c culdesac or oddshaped oddshaped lots ie lots on culdesacs or lots where the difference between the length of the front property line and back property line is greater than five feet the front footage is computed by dividing the area of the lot by the average depth of the lot if the oddshaped lot is deeper than 200 feet the front footage shall be computed by determining the area assuming a 200foot depth then dividing that area by 200 feet the appendix contains an example of calculating assessable front footage for culdesacs and oddshaped lots d approximately rectangular a lot which is approximately rectangular the front footage is computed by averaging the front and back property lines of the lot if the lot is deeper than 200 feet the front footage shall be computed by averaging the length of the front property line and width of the lot at the point 200 feet deep into the lot this method is used only where the divergence between front and rear lot lines is five feet or less e double frontage lots which front on streets being improved on both the front and back property lines the property will only be assessed on the basis of the average of the two frontages f assessments of multifamily housing all property containing multifamily dwellings shall be considered commercial property and shall therefore be assessed at the commercialindustrial rate as defined by this assessment manual g minimum footage the city reserves the right to set a minimum assessable front footage for any lot served partially or fully by improvements and supported by findings of fact for a particular project h planned unit development pud 531 the city shall use procedures to calculate front footage in planned unit developments based on the underlying zoning classification 6 service district a service district is the area as determined by the city engineer and approved by the city council which will receive benefit from a proposed improvement project this type of approach for assessment purposes is typically used for trunk and subtrunk sanitary sewer projects  trunk subtrunk source storage and treatment water projects  and trunk storm sewer projects b general 1 petition petition shall mean a written document presented to the city council for purposes of initiating a public improvement project this petition requires the signature of property owners representing not less than 35 percent of the frontage on the requested project all signatures shall be accompanied by the address of each signator the date of the signature and a printing of each signators name an example of the usual form of petition is included in the appendix 2 total project cost total project cost shall mean the final construction cost plus all associated overhead costs overhead costs shall include but not be limited to engineering city administration legal fiscal interest during construction and land acquisition 3 assessment period the length of payment period on various types of improvement projects shall be as follows sanitary sewer 1015 years watermain 1015 years storm sewer 510 years street construction 515 years street resurfacing 37 years in the case where several of the improvements listed above are included in the same project the assessment period will be 1020 years in no event shall an assessment period exceed 20 years 4 assessment deferment the city of wyoming may choose to adopt an assessment deferment policy for property owners affected by an improvement project this deferment policy may include provisions for age income or disability findings of fact this deferment would become void at such time that the property changes ownership or when the findings of fact no longer apply deferrals may also be made at the councils discretion for unimproved property affected by an improvement until such time that the property is improved the council may choose to set an expiration date for assessment deferrals for unimproved property with a deadline to be determined by the city council at the time of deferment 5 ad valorem tax the city council may at their discretion utilize an ad valorem tax to fund portions of the project cost of any public improvement this shall be done in accordance with the appropriate minnesota statutes 6 assessment rate the assessment rate for any special assessment district is computed by dividing the total assessable costs of such improvement by the total number of assessment units such as dividing the total cost of a water lateral project by the total adjusted front footage of property benefited by that project 7 assessable costs the assessable cost of an improvement shall be defined as those costs which in the opinion of the city council are attributable to the need for service in the area served by the improvement assessments shall be based on estimated costs all footages are computed to the nearest hundredth of a foot areas are computed and recorded to the nearest square foot or 1100th of an acre 8 interest rate on unpaid balance the interest rate used over the life of the assessment shall be determined at the time of the assessment hearing it shall be calculated based upon the cost of financing over the life of the assessment plus any associated overhead costs this amount shall be expressed as a percentage 9 land not included in assessment the city may reserve the right to delete land within the assessable area from the assessment roles if in its opinion the land cannot be developed andor the improvement does not provide benefit no development of that property shall be 532 permitted nor shall any physical connection to the citys utility or drainage facilities be made by any development on that property until the assessment or connection fees are paid 10 certification of assessment roll at the time the assessment rolls are adopted by the city council by resolution refer to appendix for a sample resolution the property owner may pay the entire assessment against their property in full for 30 days without interest being charged a property owner may pay the total assessment against their property with accrued interest if paid before november 15 interest is calculated to december 31 of the year the payment is made  if paid after november 15 interest will be calculated of the next year at any time during the life of the project assessment period 11 improvements to roadways not under city jurisdiction properties within the city which abut roadways not under city jurisdiction but receiving reconstruction or bituminous overlay improvements shall be assessed by the city the assessment rate levied against these properties shall be the same as those established for city reconstruction or bituminous overlay projects iii assessment policy for new developments the assessment policy for anyone who wishes to make public improvements within the city of wyoming as part of a proposed development shall conform to the policies established herein and as modified below prior to any action on the part of the city to determine the feasibility of providing public improvements the developer shall deposit such amount as determined by the city clerkadministrator and staff to adequately reimburse the city for all engineering legal and planning and other consultant fees for work performed in regard to such improvements the developer shall also execute a letter of intent to guarantee that these fees will be paid in addition the developer shall be required prior to the city ordering the installation of any city financed improvements to enter into a development agreement ensuring compliance with the policies set forth herein and all subdivision requirements of the city the developer shall also be required to post all cash deposits andor letters of credit prior to such action by the city council in all projects where the city constructs and finances the project the following security provisions shall apply a for singlefamily twofamily or townhouse residential developments the developer shall deposit with the city a cash escrow or an irrevocable letter of credit of 125 percent of the estimated project cost as determined by the city engineer if the estimated project cost as determined after receipt of bids for construction exceeds the engineers estimate by ten percent or more the deposit shall be increased proportionately the total project costs shall be assessed in equal annual installments according to the assessment period b in the case where the improvements benefit not only the property being developed but other areas within the city the developer shall provide to the city a security deposit in accordance with paragraphs described above for the portion of the estimated project costs which represent the benefit to the proposed development such portion shall be assessed against the properties benefited 1 for all other types of development the developer shall deposit with the city a cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit of 125 percent of the estimated project cost as determined by the city engineer if the estimated project cost as determined after receipt of bids for construction exceeds the engineers estimate by ten percent or more the deposit shall be increased proportionately the total project costs shall be assessed in equal annual installments according to the assessment period 2 the security deposit shall be irrevocable for the full term of any assessments for which given the agreement shall be so conditioned as to guarantee payment of the assessments as due or to pay for the cost of all improvements which the developer agreed to install 3 the required security deposit may consist of a cash escrow deposit or irrevocable letter of credit in a form acceptable to the city attorney and with firms authorized to do business in the state of minnesota iv sanitary sewer improvements a definitions l sanitary sewer trunks and subtrunks sanitary sewer pumping stations including associated forcemain andor a network of gravity pipes ranging in size generally from eightinch inch and extending toward the citys treatment plant pumping station forcemains trunks and subtrunks are designed as collectors for areas usually less than 300 acres because sewer lines flow by gravity the pipes can become quite deep at some locations and very costly to install a trunk or subtrunk assessment is in certain cases utilized so that costs due to extra depth andor oversizing will be spread over the entire service district rather than becoming a burden on just those properties abutting that portion of the pipe network constructed 2 sanitary sewer laterals a network of pipes usually eightinch in size which are installed eight20 feet deep and are designed to serve those buildings abutting a given street or easement the laterals flow to trunks or subtrunks 3 sanitary sewer building services 533 those pipes usually fourinch or sixinch in size lead from laterals or from trunks subtrunks and interceptors to serve individual buildings the services are plugged at the property line until such time that a building is connected to the sewer system the property owner must make arrangements with a licensed and bonded plumber to complete the service connection 4 sewer hookup charge & sanitary sewer availability charge sac this is a charge billed to all properties at the time of connection to the sanitary sewer system the charge is the individual property share of the cost of the interceptor trunk and treatment facilities that make sewer service available the charge is based on an equivalent unit basis the method used to calculate the total number of units for any specific property and the current unit charge are provided in the appendix this sac charge is established from time to time by the city council and may not be assessed against the property 5 sanitary sewer lateral benefits lateral benefit may be provided by connection to trunk subtrunk or lateral pipes the calculation of lateral benefit from a trunk or subtrunk pipe will be based on the cost of an eightinch pipe along the same alignment at a depth adequate to provide services to the abutting properties 6 infrastructure rehabilitation projects any project or portion of a project that reconstructs an existing sanitary sewer facility a rehabilitation project may occur on the existing alignment of the sewer line or on a new alignment thus allowing the existing line to be abandoned or its status downgraded ie trunk or subtrunk to lateral b determining sanitary sewer assessment rates l sanitary sewer trunksubtrunk rates the lateral and building service assessments will be deducted from the total improvement cost to be assessed the amount remaining after said deductions will be assessed on a gross area basis to all properties within the service district and will be known as a trunk assessment andor subtrunk assessment 2 sanitary sewer lateral rates the building service assessments described in will be deducted from the total improvement cost to be assessed the amount remaining after said deductions will be assessed by the following method the resulting assessment will be known as a lateral benefit assessment a front footage basis determine the total assessable front footage of all lots and equivalent lot units receiving lateral benefit and divide the project cost by the total of assessable front footage each lot or equivalent lot unit assessment is equal to the total assessable front footage per

appurtenances usually in the size range of eightinches to 12inches these pipes are designed to carry large volumes of water and interconnect various point sources of water supply and storage reservoirs appurtenances to these facilities would include but are not limited to valves and fittings but not fire hydrants 4 watermain laterals 534 a network of water pipes and related appurtenances usually six inches in size which are installed with approximately 7 1  2 feet of ground cover to retard freezing and are designed to serve those buildings abutting a given street or easement lateral mains are looped wherever possible to balance pressures and prevent dead ends and the associated problems appurtenances to these facilities would include but are not limited to valves fittings and fire hydrants 5 watermain building service these pipes lead from laterals or sometimes from trunk and subtrunk mains to serve individual buildings abutting thereon the size of the service usually ranges from one inch to six inch depending upon the type of building served the lines terminate at the property line with a shut off valve and are plugged until such time that the building is connected to the water system the property owner must make arrangements with a licensed and bonded plumber to complete the service connection 6 watermain lateral benefits the benefit resulting to a property abutting or utilizing a watermain where a direct connection to that watermain via a building service is reasonably possible without additional lateral pipes lateral benefit may be provided by connection to trunk subtrunk or lateral pipes the calculation of lateral benefit from a trunk or subtrunk pipe will be based on the cost of an eightinch pipe along the same alignment for commercial or industrial zoned property and a sixinch pipe for all other areas 7 infrastructure rehabilitation projects any project or portion of a project that reconstructs an existing water system facility a rehabilitation project may occur on the existing alignment of the water line or on a new alignment thus allowing the existing line to be abandoned or its status downgraded ie trunk or subtrunk to lateral 8 water access connection charge wac this is a charge billed to all properties at the time of connection to the water system the charge is the individual property share of the cost of the trunk source and storage facilities that make water service available the charge is based on the size of the connection plus the material and installation cost of a water meter the wac fee is established from time to time by the city council and may not be assessed against a property b determining watermain assessment rates 1 trunk subtrunk storage and treatment facility rates any lateral and building service assessments described below will be deducted from the total improvement cost to be assessed the remaining costs shall be spread equally to all properties that lie within the approved service district the costs shall be spread on a gross area basis and will be known as all or any of the following as appropriate  trunk subtrunk source storage and treatment assessment 2 watermain lateral rates the building service assessments described in will be deducted from the total improvement cost to be assessed the amount remaining after said deductions will be assessed by the following method the resulting assessment will be known as a lateral benefit assessment a front footage basis determine the total assessable front footage of all lots and equivalent lot units receiving lateral benefit and divide the project cost by the total of assessable front footage each lot or equivalent lot unit assessment is equal to the total assessable front footage per unit multiplied by the front footage assessment rate 3 building service the assessment rate for each size of building service one inch to six inch shall be determined by adding all the costs associated with each size of service and dividing by the total number of services constructed each unit will be assessed at the determined rate for each size and number of services installed this will be known as the building service assessment vi storm sewer improvements a definitions 1 storm sewer improvement district the city council may at its discretion construct and finance storm sewer improvements by
