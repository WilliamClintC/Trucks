 planning and zoning thirteen  building fourteen  property maintenance housing and enforcement fifteen fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either

complete the steps needed to keep the citys integrity intact this recognition can be achieved effort and imagination these enduring attributes create an inviting place for visitors and residents as well as a pleasant working environment kents physical attributes are defined by its wonderful location on the cuyahoga river the ohio and erie canal and the atlantic and great western railroad these particularly charming assets of the city determined the social and economic history of kent the physical attributes of the defined area are collectively referred to as a cultural landscape cultural landscapes are developed over time and can be read and studied by the form and type of the buildings and landscapes that remain the city of kent is known for taking advantage of the natural resources of the area and keeping up with the changing modes of transportation the city was established because settlers saw the potential and the power of the cuyahoga river thus sparking the initial growth of the community the canal and railroad followed soon thereafter creating an economic growth and boom for the emerging city these times of growth were influential to the citys planning and architecture and are still apparent in the physical form of the city these design guidelines provide assistance in maintaining or improving the present quality of life rehabilitation of the citys architecture while accommodating new construction and modifications this document provides tools resources and design guidance for application to numerous circumstances and settings illustrative examples and photographs are included to assist property owners with understanding specific situations these guidelines will be used in conjunction with one or more overlay districts designated by kent city council as outlined in chapters 1120 and 1121 of the kent zoning construction near historic structures or in an historic district should complement and support the surrounding context in order to uphold the historic integrity of the city be it traditional or contemporary stylistically the guidelines are based upon the ideas and values set forth by the united states secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation the standards pertain to the repair or alteration of historic properties and have been this countrys model for preservation practice for more than forty years development of the design guidelines the city of kent currently has three national register historic districts and numerous properties listed in the national register of historic places kent has a great collection of rich and diverse architecture that reflects the history of the city years kents design overlay district gives the community an opportunity to protect the unique character of the area without having to rezone other districts the kent design guidelines are intended to assist the community in preserving and enhancing places of special character these guidelines are written to be utilized by property owners tenants building managers property caretakers architects and builders that would be conducting work affecting an historic property the guidelines provide a framework for making good decisions about rehabilitation and new design recommendations photographs and drawings offer information and advice on how to achieve appropriate design solutions for various types of properties within the overlay districts and also throughout the city of kent the guidelines present recommendations with the idea that it is better also less expensive to repair rather than to replace an original feature however these guidelines are made to be flexible and serve as guidance for creative design solutions the format of the guidelines begins with an historical overview of the city of kent and then continues to discuss the different architectural styles that can be found in kent design principles for a building addition or constructing a new building adjacent to historic properties are also discussed within the design guidelines finally the issues of site considerations accessibility graphics  signage building color and demolition can be found historic preservation grows to be most successful when a community like kent comes together with the same purpose in mind to protect and reuse their historic resources the certified local government which is also a future option for kent is sponsored by the ohio office of historic preservation program to encourage and acknowledge those communities with needed support for processes like those described herein certified local governments also known as clgs work as a federalstatelocal partnership the communities that become part of the clg program benefit by receiving encouragement education and funding grants the process of the design guidelines is meant to protect and enhance the overall value of the property while accommodating a contemporary use design guideline goals  images0004159jpgachieve good design to help

significant structures process in order to bring about a document that can be supported by the public it was essential that there be public involvement in the process sponsored by the city of kent the burbick foundation and main street kent this project began with stakeholder participation has been sustained by public input and will culminate with a presentation to the city council the committee responsible for following this project completion was comprised of building owners design and planning professionals real estate professionals developers kent homeowners a university representative and other active members of the kent community who met on a regular basis to review critique and react to recommendations because this committee was tireless in their efforts to review and improve the document the design guidelines for the city of kent is wellvetted in the initial stages as history and documentation were gathered stakeholders from many different corners of the kent community gathered to share and learn about the process of developing and implementing design guidelines at two separate stakeholders meetings business owners homeowners landowners designers representatives from the city and kent state university joined developers attorneys members of main street kent and the kent historical society to discussed their ideal visions for the city even more exhilarating was the pride and passion with which each person described the current attributes of the tree city from these conversations several goals were established goals are listed on  in the development section of these guidelines in order to invite input from another group of community members these same goals were presented at a large and open public meeting held at the kent stage at the end of the meeting the participants were invited to prioritize the goals passed on to them by the stakeholders groups overwhelmingly the top goal selected was perpetuate good design to help economic vitality and to sustain property values the second goal selected was the city can remain cohesive in visual identity the two goals ranking third are better connection with the university and transition from architectural advisory board to architectural review board ranking these few goals ahead of the others does not diminish their significance entirely the remaining goals may be lofty but also may be achieved by working toward the above priorities assist developer with guide to design education general public should become aware of value of good design and the incentives to reach it can we make kent a fun place to be a destination point for visitors save significant structures demolitions should be reviewed as should what takes its place define the boundaries of a district but guidelines should help all of kent with the information gained from the stakeholder and public meetings the consultants assembled this set of design guidelines the first and second draft copies were reviewed by the original committee the presentation of the final draft was given at the  city council meeting on  kent city council adopted the guidelines for the purpose of using the guidelines in relation to projects which are receiving some form of city funding or financial assistance the present effort would adopt the guidelines as an overlay district in one or more areas of the city along with specific criteria and procedures for their implementation this process meets the criteria for the certified local government application requirements benefits to a property owner good design and wellexecuted design guidelines have proven to be beneficial to both the property owner and the community because they sustain social and economic growth individual property values are enhanced design and collectively these properties can greatly increase the appearance of an entire district the area becomes a destination that people want to visit and gives the city an identity a place is created where the community interacts thereby strengthening the ties between its members and the surrounding area activity supports local businesses including restaurants retail and entertainment establishments the return on the investment in time and expense is to achieve good design in preservation restoration renovation and new construction a prolonged value that far exceeds the initial investment economic benefits besides the obvious increase in pedestrian traffic can include use of preservation grants and loans rehabilitation tax credits energy efficiency tax breaks and participation in certified local government grants and loans design guidelines not only provide an opportunity to increase property value and appearance but become a tool in protecting the value of public and private investments areas that may be threatened by poorly managed growth now have the opportunity to be managed by the community there is also the benefit of attracting good developers to a thriving wellmaintained community the guidelines are a means to assist clients and their designers in preliminary design or maintenance work  they will help keep the character of the town intact and the

iroquois tribe used the cuyahoga rivers resources and standing rock as a landmark early settlers of kent were unquestionably attracted to the area because of the cuyahoga river the settlers were attracted to the land because of the water power of the cuyahoga river the river had enough force to operate numerous mills distilleries tanneries and forges aaron olmstead a business man from connecticut saw the potential of the land and bought the 25 square mile township which he named after his son franklin in 180 the haymaker family became one of the first to establish themselves on what is now known as kent jacob haymaker a german millwright and carpenter bought 8 township lots along the river and haymaker sent his son john with his wife and three children to begin construction of a mill and dam the haymakers were followed by many other businessmen that saw the potential of the river later in 181 a growth in population established the community that came to be known as franklin mills the residents considered the area divided and referred to it as the upper village and lower village in 182 the upper village was recorded as the village of carthage but the name did not stick  the residents preferred to use the name franklin mills1 during the era of the stage coach many rivalries grew between the two villages  businesses began advertising wars to persuade visitors passing come to their business rather than the one in the rival village during these years of growth a sawmill was built in 181 which allowed residents to build frame houses rather than log cabins 1 grismer karl h history of kent record publishing co 200117 in 181 the franklin mills community constructed a small cabin for their first school and in 182 the first post office was established george depeyster became the first postmaster by 183 franklin mills population grew to 1400 people and included gristmills woolen mills cabinet shops glass shops and tanneries the development of the pennsylvania and ohio canal began in the franklin mills area during the 1830s and was completed by 1840 the construction of the canal brought a lot of business to franklin mills and was a fundamental part of the growth of the community this area is now known as the business district the canal was a great resource that connected franklin mills to pennsylvania ohio lake erie and akron the canal era ended due to the development of the railroad train tracks were laid in franklin mills by 1863 in 1864 the trunk line was complete connecting the town to st louis and new york marvin kent had a big part in getting the atlantic and great western railroad routed mills the railroads helped keep the mills in business and thriving due to the location of franklin mills it became the chosen spot to build the railroad shops which offered several hundred men jobs in the area and turned franklin mills into a prosperous railroad center the residents were so grateful to marvin kent for his part in bringing railroads to franklin mills that they changed the name of the village to kent in his honor the state of ohio made the village of kent official in 1867 by acknowledging the new name and incorporated it in 187 a new railroad depot was opened in a large brick building currently housing the pufferbelly restaurant on what is now franklin avenue in the early 1900s there was a shortage of nearly 5000 teachers in the state of ohio a law was passed looking for two new locations for a teachers college one in the western half of ohio and one in the eastern half of the state kent pushed to become home to one of the schools and formed the kent board of trade and began the slogan home of the hump and hustle william s kent donated a large area of land to the community for the school in 1910 kents hard work paid off and the state of ohio gave kent the opportunity to house one of the new public teachers colleges kent state normal school now known as kent state university the arrival of the college generated another boom in kent real estate values around the college drastically increased and more streets were constructed in the area construction workers building the college brought business to the town which were later followed by faculty and students in the 20th century kent saw an industrial boom as businesses considered kent an excellent site to manufacture goods the davey tree expert company is one of the most wellknown businesses that was established in kent  founded in 1909 by john davey the davey tree expert company is a leader in their industry and by 1920 the company was given 14 patents the company headquarters still remain in kent but have additional offices throughout the country and in canada the company developed techniques such as line clearance and vegetation management for utility companies and the removal of large trees the company made significant advances in the technology of bucket trucks insect control brush chippers and speed saws john daveys son martin l davey is known at a state level for being elected governor of ohio martin graduated from kents high school and later attended oberlin college martin was elected mayor of kent in 1915 and 1917 in 1918 he held a position in the house of representatives as a democrat he was re elected to the house three more times before running for governor in 1928 after losing his first race he won in 1934 and was reelected two years later martin returned to the family business fulltime after serving as the governor environmental features in addition to architectural style the natural environments in which the buildings are set contribute to the character of the kent design overlay district the cuyahoga river flows center of the city of kent the water source for the gristmills of the original village and later the pennsylvania and ohio canal resulted in the establishment of a thriving industrial town and the cuyahoga river remains an important resource of natural beauty and recreation for the community today the monumental kent dam hand cut from sandstone in the form of a sweeping arch and the only known dam of its kind attached to a canal lock still stands as an historic tribute to kents industrial past the dam built in 183 has been listed in the national register of historic places for environmental reasons the river has been rerouted historic canal lock and the area behind the dam is now home to the green lawn gardens and observation platforms of heritage park the majestic waterfall cascading over the dam remains as a symbolic backdrop for the city of kent there are also several wooded parks located along the rivers edge in addition to being sites of scenic beauty and rich ecosystems these parks also offer a multitude of opportunities for outdoor activities hiking trails recreational facilities observation decks and beachlike landing spots to encourage community participation in the natural environment adding to the greenery of the natural landscape the ambitious effort of planting hundreds of trees around the city undertaken by john davey in 188 resulted in the city of kent being designated as the first tree city in america the

and reached america by way of england the most notable defining feature of this style the mansard roof was named after the architect francois mansart because of his widespread use of this roof type in his designs this style also was popular for remodeling buildings because the mansard roof provided a fullstory attic space which was not historically taxed as usable space the second empire mansard roof generally comes in five shapes straight straight with flare concave convex and scurve it is common to find decorative patterns of color or texture on the roof with an iron crested cornice widows

design publication of his book hints on household taste published in 1868 this look deviates from the curvilinear earlier styles in favor of angular notched and carved elements influenced by medieval

empire queen anne and stick he later adapted these styles creating a new style that became known as richardsonian romanesque this style creates the appearance of a massive and solid structure causing it to become popular for large public buildings of that time the common romanesque revival form is a hipped roof with a cross gable but was also built in town house form the buildings are often constructed out of roughfaced stonework with two or more colors creating decorative wall patterns widerounded arches are a distinct feature above windows entryway or porches the arches are supported by massive piers or are built into the wall the romanesque revival was less common in residential design in ohio because its solid masonry construction was expensive identifying features

originated in england with a group of architects under the leadership of richard norman shaw who also introduced the style in america during the philadelphia centennial exhibition of 1876 pattern books detailing the design encouraged the advancement of this style across america popularity of the queen anne style grew because the defining decorative elements could be precut and transported by railroad a boom in the economy during the time this style was popular resulted in many structures being built in the queen anne style the queen anne roof is irregular in shape and is steeply pitched with a dominant frontfacing gable methods are used to avoid a smoothwalled appearance such as patterned shingles and cutaway bay windows the building is normally asymmetrical with a one story high partial or fullwidth porch four decorative detailing types are common on a queen anne style building spindlework free classic halftimbered and patterned masonry spindlework is present on the porch

style 18901935 by the late 19th century many american architects and their clients had visited italy to see and experience the style first hand technology was improving and so was the quality of printing the use of photographs to document the buildings became popular the earlier italianate style was based on pattern book drawings by professionals with no firsthand knowledge of italian buildings after world war i masonry veneering was perfected which allowed buildings to closely imitate the stucco or masonry walls of the original italian models italian renaissance structures are symmetrical in form and typically found with low pitched roofs that are covered in ceramic tile including broadly overhanging boxed eaves with decorative brackets below the eaves all openings have arches above them and the upper windows are less elaborate than the first floor fullheight windows the entrances are recessed and supported with small classical columns or pilasters identifying

interest after the worlds colombian exposition in 1893 and the 1901 panamerican exhibition in san francisco famous architects of that time showcased their dramatic designs of white colonnaded buildings the buildings of the exposition were monumental and inspired many commercial and public buildings thereafter in the first half of the 20th century neoclassical became a popular style for domestic buildings throughout the country the first wave of these buildings occurred from 1900 1920 and displayed hipped roofs elaborate classic columns and pedimental entries the second phase occurred from 19251950 which included sidegabled roofs and simple columns neoclassical houses normally have a boxed eave with a moderate overhang and employ fullheight porches that are supported with classical columns with ionic or corinthian capitals the facade is symmetrical with a central door and balanced windows the door is elaborately decorated and the windows are doublehung and rectangular

style19001925 the craftsman style was part of an international movement of style art and philosophy with william morris a 19th century english designer being a large part of the movement the craftsman style in the united states was inspired by two california brothers charles sumner greene and henry mather greene their designs were influenced by the english arts and crafts movement and oriental wood architecture the designs focused on the natural beauty of the materials and detailed craftsmanship with simple clean lines ornamentation was kept to a minimum publications of green & greens designs in magazines such as the ladies home journal and good housekeeping helped to popularize the style furniture manufacturer gustav stickley published a popular magazine called the craftsman featuring both architectural and furniture designs the style became so prevalent that a flood of pattern books were produced some companies such as sears offered entire packages of precut lumber doors windows plaster trim and fixtures  the craftsman style porch is supported by columns that are short and square and sit upon simple pedestals  these pedestals columns and piers frequently extend to the ground the most familiar characteristic is the roof overhang the roof rafters are usually exposed and sometimes have decorative details the doors and windows are similar to prairie style homes the dormers have gables with exposed rafters at the end the most common wallcladding is wood clapboard and woodshingles however stone brick concrete block and stucco variations can be found in northern or

style 19251940 art deco style grew during the time period between the two world wars the exposition des arts decoratifs an exhibition held in paris in 192 was part of an international style movement it was inspired by cubism futurism and constructivism  americas obsession with the future speed and transportation such as the car and train was also a driving force behind this movement the style was honest and simple but most of all it was functional the structures combined rectilinear massing futuristic images stylized ornament and polychromatic effects this glamorous style changed the shape of

chooses to take advantage of the federal or state historic preservation tax credits that owner must follow the standards for rehabilitation appendix b  which are the principles upon which the kent guidelines are based what does adoption of the kent design guidelines mean adoption of these design guidelines means that the citizens of kent wish to be proactive in the success of their community acknowledging kents special heritage and its unique and eclectic architectural personality the guidelines are a tool for the community especially within the recommended design overlay district and any future designated area to protect and support the character that brings such pride the guidelines are a tool to assist the public and to assist the architectural review board so as to support consistent recommendations in the end the goal declared by the community throughout this process is perpetuate good design to help economic vitality and sustain property values preservation philosophy the preservation philosophy that these design guidelines aim to uphold is based on the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation the philosophys intent is to retain original or historic building materials to the greatest extent possible and to avoid creating a false historic appearance when elements must be replaced replacement materials should match the originals in size color and texture substitute materials such as vinyl for wood should be avoided new additions and new construction may be distinguishable from the historic while being compatible with the existing structure or surrounding structures additions and new construction should be reversible so if removed it will not impair the historic structures form or integrity   images0004162jpg  preservation principles refer to the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation located in appendix b design principles building typology in addition to understanding building styles it is important to understand general building types building type or typology is the form a building takes related to its materials function and visual organization it also can describe a regional or vernacular method of building related to form rather than style and ornament it is important to be able to describe critique and prioritize these components of architecture successful design within an existing historic context includes both an understanding of the typology of the existing structures as well as the meaning of their style in a place in time   images0004165jpg  fabric and object buildings within the context of the kent design overlay district there are two principal building categories fabric buildings and object buildings fabric buildings make up the sense of place and they define general character and set scale fabric buildings typically have a commercial or residential use they are the majority of the buildings and are usually built during the same time period they are principally a commercial block type with a basic threepart form a glass storefront base upper floors with punched window openings and some form of cornice the majority have a flat roof object buildings are buildings of cultural or civic importance and have a symbolic presence to kent object buildings can include churches post offices theaters libraries town halls courthouses and other civic or cultural institutions these buildings have a variety of forms and visual organization and are not necessarily part of the towns standard fabric    658980d7ed03c29d6e0c7b3bb03049519a80089d 658980d7ed03c29d6e0c7b3bb03049519a80089d images0004168jpg images0004171jpg it is important to respect the common building height proportion and lot setback and placement of buildings in coverage should be compatible with the order to maintain the continuity of the dominant form on the street streetscape  when considering the application of design principles to new work in an existing context the priority of the design principles ranges from the general to the specific a well designed building placed poorly on the site undermines the overall design a poorly proportioned building with elaborate details will fail to fit within an existing context because the observer sees the form first and the details second conversely a building placed and proportioned appropriately with simplified or contemporary details will work well within an existing context therefore the priority of the design elements should be as follows building placement form solidvoid pattern facade organization materialscolortexture details     658980d7ed03c29d6e0c7b3bb03049519a80089d 658980d7ed03c29d6e0c7b3bb03049519a80089d 658980d7ed03c29d6e0c7b3bb03049519a80089d images0004174jpg images0004177jpg images0004180jpg  building placement within an existing context of historic buildings there is a customary or prescribed building placement it is important to respect the common setback and placement of buildings in order to maintain the continuity of the streetscape this should be regarded as a build to line as well as a building setback consideration should also be given to the vistas both along the streetscape or roadway for structures set near the road and from the road for structures set back away from the road carefully consider any new construction adjacent to the existing structures will the new construction interfere with the views form whenever possible the existing historic context of the building form should be respected including the volume of the form in relation to its site building height proportion and lot coverage should be compatible with the dominant form on the street orientation of the form to the street also should be the same as the context for example if all of the buildings on a given street are gablefronted facing the street new infill buildings should have a similar form and orientation solidvoid pattern the ratio and pattern of walltowindow openings is common within a given building type and age respecting this pattern helps to unify the streetscape facade organization horizontal versus vertical facade organization of architectural elements is usually similar within a given context some buildings have prominent horizontal elements such as belt courses continuous sills or lintels or projecting cornices or entablatures other buildings exhibit an emphasis of vertical elements such as continuous pilasters that separate the facade into spandrel panels when a dominant pattern of either horizontal or vertical organization exists in the historic context this pattern should be imitated by any new construction materialscolortexture selecting materials that are compatible in color and texture with adjacent structures helps to create a unified design within the district details imitating details of historic structures exactly when creating new structures is generally not necessary or desirable respecting the general placement form visual organization colors and materials within a given context is sufficient to create a new building that is compatible it is not necessary to create a replica of an historic building by copying exact details simplified details of similar proportions to those found within the district are sufficient   images0004183jpg  general recommendations in caring for kent historic structures  images0004159jpginspect and maintain building elements on a regular basis  images0004159jpgrepair before replacing elements or materials replacement is an option only after all other possibilities have been considered  images0004159jpgavoid adding elements to a building that were not originally present missing elements  images0004159jpgreplace or reconstruct the missing element using materials that match the original as closely as possible  images0004159jpgif no evidence can be found to document the elements original appearance replacement should be consistent with the buildings size scale and materials the replacement should be simplified to avoid creating a detail that may not have been part of the original design  images0004159jpgexamining other buildings of the same architectural style can help determine what may be appropriate deteriorated elements  images0004159jpgavoid giving a false impression of historic character by use of ornament not appropriate to the time period and stylistic influences repair deteriorated elements as soon as possible to prevent further damage or loss of material if an historic element is deteriorated beyond repair and removal has been approved document with photographs and measurements before removal then reproduce the element matching the original design and materials nonoriginal element  images0004159jpgif an element has been previously replaced consider retaining the existing element if it is unique aesthetically complements the building or is a good example of what was in style in its own time ie a welldesigned and constructed 1880s porch on an 1840s house  images0004159jpgif the element is considered inappropriate for the building replace the element with one that is appropriate salvage material  images0004159jpgavoid adding elements to a building from other structures this generally creates a false history and would be inappropriate respect each building for its own design and style if salvage material is used for repairs such as old brick that matches the correct size and color it is appropriate to mark the salvage items on the back so that they can be identified later storefront the main purpose of storefronts and their windows is to display items for sale in a store they are however a very important part of the pedestrian experience influencing the public perspective of the district   images0004186jpg  traditional storefronts were regularly designed in a threepart composition a fairly low bulkhead at the base large glass display windows and transom windows at the top providing additional natural light to the interior transom windows often had small panes of prism glass that gathered light and projected it toward the rear of the stores surviving historic storefront elements such as bulkheads wood or metal trim or window hardware and transom windows should be retained if at all possible such elements are part of the fabric of historic kent and contribute to its character and high visual quality designs for new storefronts or renovations to existing ones should be respectful of the size and proportions of elements typical of the areas older storefronts they should for example have bulkheads display windows and transoms the storefront must fit within the original storefront opening that is defined by end piers or columns and horizontal members piers and columns should remain exposed    658980d7ed03c29d6e0c7b3bb03049519a80089d  images0004189jpg  658980d7ed03c29d6e0c7b3bb03049519a80089d images0004192jpg  refrain from making the storefront look like a residence or office use of small or multipaned windows if necessary screen large display windows with interior blinds if privacy is desired for an office use traditional materials should be used when storefronts are rehabilitated or reconstructed in older buildings bulkheads should be paneled wood for 19th and early 20th century buildings though ceramic tile was sometimes used especially in the 1920s brick and stucco were not typically seen in the bulkhead area display windows usually were supported by fairly light wood or metal framing systems leaving a maximum glass area heavy wood framing or masonry materials were not typically used in the display transom windows were commonly framed in wood or metal the glass was usually clear to transmit maximum natural light into the store doors entrances of historic buildings have always been one of the main elements that help define the overall style and design of a structure typically the door is the main focus of the entrance it is because of this that many historic doors have been decorated and embellished with moldings and other decorative panels and motifs found throughout the structure in maintaining the general style and importance of an historic structure it is essential to preserve the value and significance of an historic entrance door historic entrance doors should be preserved and maintained whenever possible they should be kept in operable condition allowing for smooth opening and closing doors performing poorly should be rehung before shaving or undercutting their hardware and thresholds should be tightened and maintained historic doors that do not match the time period of the structure should still be preserved as existing historic doors are more valuable and accurate than any new door designed to match the building only deteriorated or missing portions of an historic entrance door should be replaced these replaced elements should be reproduced to match the original material and style if replacement of the entire door is necessary the original frame should be preserved maintaining the dimensions and location of the door historic hardware and glazing should be salvaged and preserved it is preferred that the replacement door be a replica of the historic door if this is not possible the new door should match the style of the historic structure a new entrance door to an historic building should be contemporary in design but compatible in size scale material and color with the style of the building restoration of a missing historic door is appropriate only with historical pictorial or physical documentation because doors are such a prominent feature in a building it is essential that the door restored or reconstructed hold the style of the structure without altering its character for example a residential type door should not be placed on a commercial building awnings canopies cornices & parapets awnings and canopies these features are used to shade window openings to keep down the interior heat in the summer awnings typically made of canvas or similar heavy fabric are mounted on solid metal or pipe frames awnings provided protection both from the sun and from inclement weather and they can often be rolled or retracted to allow the sun into the building during cool weather with the current interest in green practices awnings are a highly efficient passive device considered to be a worthwhile investment not just for appearances fabric awnings are an appropriate treatment for most residences in the historic districts and for many commercial structures avoid fixed permanent canopies unless it can be shown that a building had them in the past and that the canopy design is compatible with the original character of the building and the specific district each window or door should have its own awning rather than a single fullwidth awning covering multiple openings or an entire facade use a traditional flat sloping awning awnings should have a matte rather than a glossy surface avoid rounded or bullnose awnings except at roundheaded window openings where the rounded awning shape is appropriate awning color is important manufacturers can provide durable longlasting fabric for awnings in a wide range of colors awning colors should be compatible with historically appropriate colors used on the building avoiding ornate patterns or too many colors cornices and parapets the cornice is a projecting horizontal band at the top of the facade commercial structures often have an additional cornice located at the top of the storefront the parapet is a low wall that extends along the roof edge this wall often has decorative detailing and is frequently combined with the cornice to produce a cohesive crown on the buildings facade the combined elements are typically a more elaborate design of the cornice and frieze located at the top of the storefront ornamentation including the style of trim and use of brackets to support the cornice is distinct to a specific architectural style address cornice and parapet repair immediately if repairs must be delayed take measures to keep the public safe from debris that may fall from above the cornice and parapet should not be covered with nonoriginal or incompatible materials unless it can be demonstrated there are no other reasonable alternatives waterproofing treatments can prevent the parapets from properly drying after a rain or snow fall thereby causing more damage  this type of treatment should be avoided upper floors the upper floors of the 19th and early 20th century commercial buildings in kent are designed with a rhythmic pattern of windows and may utilize projections such as towers oriels or balconies to create a more three dimensional appearance windows on the facade of the upper floors are often embellished with ornament that is characteristic of the buildings architectural style the size spacing and proportions of the windows are determined by the overall composition of the building and its storefront these windows were typically doublehung and contain clear glass panes the number of window panes relates to the style of the building upperfloor windows usually have oneoverone doublehung sash by the end of the 19th century a few buildings have windows with metal sash revealing a narrow profile   images0004195jpg  the most economical and historically appropriate method for revitalizing windows is to repair the original ones new windows are generally heavier with bulkier sash and muntins and do not retain the appearance of the original windows the older glass also has characteristic imperfections that new glass will not have when windows need to be altered or replaced infilled downsized or replaced with contemporary windows original window openings should be maintained at their original size it may be appropriate to use new replacement windows with the same profile as the originals occasionally it is necessary to replace severely deteriorated windows if approved new windows need to match the profile design material size and construction of the original to discourage vandalism and avoid an abandoned appearance interior window treatments may be added to unoccupied floors exterior storm windows are recommended to increase energy efficiency and help preserve the historic windows storm sash should complement the dimensions of the historic windows interior storms may be preferred in limited circumstances involving highly ornate windows they must be ventilated to avoid condensation buildup on the historic sash and trim other windows accessories such as added shutters or added ornament are inappropriate without evidence that they were originally present other architectural features that may appear on kents historic buildings are balconies oriels and projections often these types of features were used to give dimension to the upper parts of taller buildings intact architectural projections should remain and be maintained reproduction of missing features should be considered when historic documentation presents evidence of the elements prior existence consider uncovering these elements if a contemporary facade hides them from view porches porches are key elements that help define the character of both the building and the streetscape porches are the architectural transition between the public street and the building interior it is important to maintain the original porch structure and porch elements including railings posts steps and ornament if one of those elements needs to be replaced duplicate it using the same material and design enclosing a porch is an extreme change to a significant feature and should be avoided if constructing a new porch to replace a missing porch model the design on archival or physical evidence to the greatest extent possible if neither exists refer to examples of historic porches on comparable structures and keep the design simple foundations building foundations in the kent design overlay district range from rubble stone pieces of stone simply picked up and carried to the building site to cut stone which was worked by hand to brick or more modern materials such as rockfaced concrete block and poured concrete the purpose of each foundation is the same the foundation carries the weight of the building down into the soil spreading the weight so as not to exceed the bearing capacity of the soil on some buildings the foundations rise only slightly above ground level and often are nearly invisible on others higher foundations became part of the buildings visual character many of the kents foundations have extra detailing such as chiseled margins peaned surfaces or other markings from the quarrying process improper maintenance or alterations to foundations can adversely affect their capacity to function properly the building can settle resulting in cracked plaster damaged masonry and uneven floors it should be noted that buildings can settle immediately after their construction causing the same effects along with windows and doors out of plumb if the initial settlement has ceased the problems may be minor  continuing settlement is a problem for which to seek professional help to prolong the life and reduce necessary maintenance on the foundation there are a few things that can be accomplished soil paving materials and plantings beds must slope away from the foundation to provide positive drainage check gutters and downspouts or internal drainage systems to be sure that they are operating properly if gutters are sloped improperly water will spill down the side of the building be sure that downspouts are connected into underground drains or empty onto splash blocks or extensions of pipe that carry the water away from the buildings base be sure also that the downspouts do not empty onto pedestrian paths foundations like to breathe the easiest way to do that is to allow 18 to 24 inches clear space from the foundation to any planting vines and other plants should not be allowed to grow on the foundation if vines are a desired feature they should be cut all the way back to the base periodically they will grow faster and softer if they are clear cut dirt mulch and firewood should be piled away from the foundation as they hold the dampness and often hold termites yes termites will go masonry foundation most foundations are ventilated if there are vents in the walls it is important to keep the air flowing   consider adding ventilation if there is none if security is an issue consider adding a simple iron grate in front of the opening avoid cutting new openings in foundation walls if you do such alterations do it with the advice of an architect or structural engineer to avoid the possibility of weakening the foundation exterior walls exterior wall materials vary throughout kent ranging from brick and stone to several types of wood siding  kents buildings are a menagerie of architectural styles the general approach to the exterior walls of historic structures is to maintain the original materials their lifespan increases with proper care brick walls need to be kept clean of salt from sidewalks in the winter and vines from the summer gardens occasionally the owner may find the need to repoint the mortar joints it is essential to clean using the gentlest means possible highpressure water methods can drive water into the walls causing problems on the inside of the building and errosion and damage to the exterior whether the walls are brick or wood the original material should not be covered  the act of covering can be detrimental to the original materials and detracts from the original design altering the original details and the original colors and textures of the building if the building has already been covered with a subsequent siding consider removing it substitute materials such as vinyl or aluminum are not appropriate for use in the kent design overlay district even on new construction within an historic district vinyl and aluminum siding may not be appropriate refer to the national park service preservation briefs on subsistent materials for further information repair of existing siding is the best option for repair of severely deteriorated wood siding in the kent design overlay district new siding should be designed purchased or milled to duplicate the appearance of the original siding matching its width profile and material siding will remain in good condition if the owner ensures the integrity of the finishes on the siding if the original material was painted it is necessary to maintain a good painted finish roofs gutters chimneys skylights and dormers together the roof gutter and downspout provide a path for collected water to be removed before it can enter the building moisture is a primary cause of damage to building materials and historic elements removing water before it infiltrates the building or the finishes can prevent a multitude of problems and is much easier to do than trying to remove water once it is inside the roof of a multistory commercial structure in kent is typically flat and sloped only slightly towards the back of the building to assist with water drainage the roofs on residential or adaptive use residential now commercial are most likely sloped and in a variety of configurations the guidelines are the same however if the roof is flat it is appropriate to use modern materials when the roof is reapplied some items to watch for would include proper repair of the parapets and proper detailing for the materials that are applied to the flat roof maintain proper drainage from any roof on roofs where the materials are seen from the ground or from adjacent buildings the original material is the ideal roof covering if the original roof can be repaired that would be the recommended course of action slate wood or tile shingles add character to the original design the original materials however have often been replaced in this case it is ideal to restore with characteristic historical materials but using a more economical shingle may be a reasonable approach an acceptable replacement material changing the configuration of the roof no matter how slightly can alter the appearance of a building drastically historic ridge caps weather vanes dormers and chimneys should be repaired and maintained chimneys can sometimes be used for mechanical chases or capped but their appearance on the roof is extremely important to the character of the historic building ensure also that gutters and downspouts are operational to increase the longevity of the roof and building system new skylights passive solar energy should be flat to the roof and may be considered on an historic building if they cannot be seen from the public view skylights were used historically as well properly restoring an existing skylight is appropriate and encouraged often historic skylights were covered to prevent leaking with new technology there are some appropriate methods to upgrade historic skylights to prevent leaking and energy loss roof top equipment of any type is detrimental to the appearance of buildings and may be used only if the elements are not visible from the streetscape outbuildings the description of outbuildings includes the garages sheds barns and carriage houses often associated with older residential buildings sometimes these buildings reflect the architectural design of the house with which they are associated often these structures are simple utilitarian design because outbuildings contribute to the areas overall character property owners should give due consideration to their care and construction original outbuildings such as garages carriage houses sheds and barns should be left in place and repaired as necessary these structures add variety and character and their removal should be avoided when outbuildings need repair or when deteriorated elements must be replaced use new materials that match the old as closely as possible avoid modern materials that are incompatible with original designs of these structures newlyconstructed outbuildings should take design cues from the older nearby structures the design should use forms massing roof shape materials window and door types and detailing similar to those found on the main structure or other nearby outbuildings the goal should be to create a new building compatible in appearance with those already in the neighborhood signage signs are often controversial  perhaps it is because the contents are so personal the sign is the face the business displays to the public with importance similar to that of the buildings faade occasionally a sign is deemed by popular opinion to be offensive ideally popular opinion is not the most positive approach nor the most direct approach to good design in an effort to quell the controversy over signage many cities and towns have zoning ordinances to standardize sign size placement content construction and illumination kents sign requirements are currently included in the planning and zoning the codified ordinances and can be enforced in a manner similar to any other zoning violation future coordination with the current sign regulations and these design guidelines should be a goal for the city the zoning requirements for signage shall supercede these design guidelines however upon recommendation by the architectural review board the citys board of zoning appeals may consider the granting of a zoning variance for a sign within the design overlay district sometimes overlooked the sign is a powerful tool for advertising and business purposes  however equally powerful is the image that the sign conveys about a particular business and the commercial district as a whole the style and design of signage has evolved over time but its purpose has always been the same to demonstrate to potential customers and clients the purpose of a business and how to find it early 19th century signs were often painted directly on the building or were painted on wooden signboards that could be attached to the building care and maintenance of these traditionally painted building signs should be encouraged signs could be mounted flush on the building wall but could also be suspended out over the sidewalk perpendicular to the building historically these suspended signs were often supported by ornamental wooden brackets by the late 19th century there was a greater variety of signage types and designs signs were incorporated as part of the storefront design some used leaded or stained glass and some were painted on the inside of display windows historic commercial buildings often provide clues to the form and location of an appropriate sign during the late 19th century and the early 20th century signs were frequently integrated into the design of the storefronts and buildings space above the storefront was often reserved for a sign board or for a projecting sign hanging perpendicular to the storefront display windows sometimes held painted window signs fabric awnings also provided location for signage signs such as these might contain letters painted or applied individual letters or symbols which gave a quick graphic reference to the business inside these signs reflected appropriate treatments for a commercial district sign by use of quality materials and design pedestrian scale proportional size and appropriate location new signage should be designed and constructed using materials and methods that are consistent with the buildings architectural style the size should be limited to the smallest size necessary to reach the public the kent zoning requirements for the the maximum size number and placement of signs size should relate to the location for which it will be placed on the building color and lettering of the sign should complement the architectural character of the building when attaching the signs one should be conscious not to damage historic materials small signs can be placed at secondary entrances that are accessible to the public in order to identify the business and should also comply with the above recommendations if permitted by the kent zoning signs that address the second floor may also be allowed if permitted by the kent zoning in an effort to attract attention signage is sometimes inappropriately designed sized and placed on buildings resulting in a negative effect upon both the business and the entire area business owners should remember that treating the signs as an integral part of commercial architecture can have a positive impact on the appearance of the buildings and the historic districts the impact signs may have on the district and especially the adjacent structures is important but is often difficult to measure if the signs are poorly maintained clearly that can have a negative effect the current zoning code has maintenance provisions these guidelines suggest a reasonable approach to the design of the sign just as one would approach the design of the building the use of neon shall be regulated by the sign regulations in the kent zoning if permitted such neon signage shall not be allowed to flash or appear to move  the guidelines suggest that the signs be stylistically appropriate to the building and to the district if the building is a 1950s stainless steel diner neon may be appropriate if the building is a 1940s theater a large marquee with flashing lights may be appropriate neither neon or flashing signage types are appropriate for a converted italianate home that now serves as offices it should be noted that other considerations in the design of the signage would include light pollution and unnecessary use of energy in a pedestrian friendly downtown district one may suggest that signs of a more modest scale be recommended rather than those required to be read from the highway it is necessary to refer to the zoning the city of kent along with the guidelines to be sure that the signage and lighting are appropriately designed exterior lighting exterior lighting is a necessary feature of an architectural environment it is generally used for safety and aesthetic purposes lighting allows pedestrians to see where they are going illuminating a pathway or obstacle in front of them it instills a sense of security in people while in public spaces proper lighting can also provide charm and visual identity to an historic building brightening an inviting entry or casting light on an important architectural feature could enhance the character of an historical structure existing historic light fixtures should be preserved and maintained whenever possible removing existing lighting could alter the character of a historic structure and is strongly discouraged exterior lighting should be used to illuminate entrances walkways and significant architectural features it should be appropriate and compatible with the style of the historic building lighting should be kept at low levels of intensity so that neighboring properties will not be affected by excess light new lighting should be minimal  it is recommended that fixtures are simple durable and discreet any new lighting installed on a structure should cause no damage to the building and should be fully reversible historic interiors building interiors are generally not regulated by city guidelines are helpful to those building owners who may wish some assistance for building owners who are taking advantage of the state or federal historic preservation tax credit the interiors are important because the ohio historic preservation office will request a description of the buildings interior if a building has an interior with original features it may be prudent to respect the existing material it is recommended that owners of historic properties consider maintaining and retaining the interior features of their buildings interior features are equally important to understanding a buildings historic architectural and cultural value it is important to research and identify key original elements of the building interior if possible retain original floor plans particularly key circulation elements such as interior hallways and stairways avoid subdividing large spaces unnecessarily joining smaller spaces always try to retain the original features such as interior trim doors interior hardware mantels and cabinetry avoid furring out walls to install insulation or wiring which usually requires removal of the original trim installing dropped ceilings or covering original plaster walls with paneling should not be done removing plaster to expose brickwork or other masonry that would not have originally been left unfinished is not recommended it is advisable to not paint millwork or woodwork that has not already been painted likewise the recommendation for traditionally painted surfaces is for a similar finish commerical use of residential structures when reusing a house to serve a different function than its original intent the reuse should remain true to the buildings original design and architectural style residences should not be significantly altered to accommodate a commercial purpose if the basic layout and square footage of the structure is not sufficient adaptive reuse for the particular function may not be appropriate the size of the structure contributes to the scale of an historic district therefore caution should be used if it is necessary to enlarge a structure when adapted to a new use do not alter the size number or style of window openings alterations to the entrance doors and door openings may be considered necessary to provide accessibility retain floor plans and elements of the historic interior that help define the character of the building  including size and configuration of rooms service areas and new stairs should be located in secondary spaces avoid altering spaces that are significant to the buildings character including subdividing spaces or cutting new holes in floors and ceilings avoid covering historic features including the installation of drop ceilings that will cover ornamental ceilings or interfere with the tops of windows and window trim retain characterdefining features and finishes such as columns baseboards fireplaces and mantels and plaster avoid the removal relocation or alteration of historic stairs from their original configuration and location new mechanical systems should be designed and installed in a way that will not harm characterdefining spaces features or finishes  parking should be in proportion to the property and the building in both placement and scale however it should be carefully planned to direct patrons to the front door of the building rather than a secondary entrance additions and new construction additions construction of an addition can often solve the need for more space because an addition can have a significant impact upon the character and appearance of an existing building the design must be developed carefully owners should take into consideration issues of form scale proportion materials placement and detail the addition must meet the kent zoning which is generally concerned with lot size setbacks placement and parking for additions material should be chosen for its compatibility with those of the original building it is not necessary to use exactly the same materials a frame addition is appropriate for a brick building for example but avoid materials that are not appropriate to the style and time period of the original structure scale form massing and quality are important even when discussing only materials brick stucco or beveled siding all may be appropriate depending upon the original building material for example a masonry building could have either a masonry addition such as brick or stucco or a frame addition for an original wood building on the other hand a frame addition would be appropriate while a brick or stucco addition most likely would not new construction limited opportunities exist for new construction because development is restricted by the amount of land available a new structure is classified as either an infill building or a freestanding building an infill building is any new building constructed on a site with one or more of its walls adjoining adjacent buildings the infill site is one that is vacant because it was either never developed or a building was removed from the site a freestanding building is on an open site some distance away from any neighboring buildings the demolition of existing historically or architecturally significant structures to accommodate new construction should be discouraged unless it can be demonstrated that the physical condition of the building has deteriorated significantly that a practical use of the building is not feasible or that the renovation of the building is economically impractical an addition or new structure should fit within the context of the existing building and its surroundings for both an addition and a new structure compatibility can be achieved by relating to scale form massing and the building elements discussed in these guidelines see impact on design on  quality design materials and craftsmanship should be incorporated in additions and new construction setbacks from the street should remain consistent with what was established commercial as well as residential structures typically maintain a common setback that defines the space created by a streetscape existing additions may be retained if they contribute to the character and historic integrity of the structure access for people with disabilities when carrying out work on an existing building or constructing a new building accommodations must be made for people with disabilities in accordance with established regulations the americans with disabilities act ada is a civil rights act intended to offer people with disabilities the same opportunities and enjoyment as the general public in employment access to public buildings and transportation in turn businesses will benefit from the additional patronage this act applies to existing and new structures including spaces that are leased for public use title v ada specifically addresses building additions alterations and historic preservation reference preservation brief 32 appendix c regulations for building accessibility ada accessibility guidelines adaag state and local building codes note allow for some exceptions for historic properties see chapter 34 of the ohio building based upon the international building  additional information and assistance is available from the local ada & it technical assistance center funded by the us department of education national institute on disability and rehabilitation research title v the act accessible buildings historic preservation provides some flexibility in meeting accessibility requirements where such requirements would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building some provisions of ada apply regardless of whether an existing building is undergoing a complete rehabilitation the need to comply with ada already exists  the need to meet the building code is triggered by a decision to rehabilitate concerns about the applicability of ada to your building or about whether the historic preservation provisions may provide flexibility with compliance may be addressed with an architect with preservation and compliance experience ramps and lifts sometimes needed to provide the disabled with access to buildings can have a significant visual impact their location design and materials are important these elements should be designed to minimize their impact on the entry facade the design of ramps and handrails should be simple and contemporary and not necessarily try to mimic any existing handrails materials should be the same as or similar to those used in the building itself avoid nontraditional materials such as unpainted wood also avoid solid masonry walls which can make a ramp much more visually prominent than it needs to be if providing access to a buildings front entrance is only a matter of overcoming a few inches difference between sidewalk and entrance consider re doing a portion of the sidewalk so that it is sloped upward to accommodate the height difference in such a case a handrail may not even be necessary likewise if the building is set back from the street often the grade can be sloped to avoid the appearance of a ramp consider use of a lift rather than a ramp in some cases experience has shown that when the height to be overcome exceeds about three feet ramps and lifts tend to cost about the same a lift can be especially useful when space for a ramp is limited or when the visual impact of a ramp would be too great  building color new methods for making paint and pigments expanded the range of colors available during transitions in historic styles color is directly associated with the historic architectural style and the concurrent advancements in technology largely impacting the character of the structure color is a distinctive element of the building design the expression of color in a commercial structure may be slightly different than that of a residential structure the predominant color should be complemented by the paint colors selected for the trim ornamental details doors windows and storefronts considerations for color selections should include the architectural style and how the selected colors work together including color inherent in the masonry while paint analysis to reveal original colors is often possible such analysis is not always necessary conducting a bit of research into an historic building and its style will give the owner a basis upon which to select colors finding a typical regional example of the style is an excellent guide see appendix d for reference generally a guideline for color is to consider the building in three parts the main body the trim and the window sash and doors the architectural style is a basis for which elements are different colors and which elements are the same much documentation is available for this type of information when it is appropriate to use multiple colors for the main body changes in color generally occur where different materials are used some architectural styles are distinct because of the use of accent colors consider the building as a whole  and be selective when choosing what to accent the key to the selection and application of colors is consistent across the facade for example all window sashes should be the same color painting of brick is not recommended be sure to follow proper preparation procedures so that the time and effort on color selection is not wasted on prematurely failing paint when approaching the design review board for a certificate of appropriateness for a painting project there are two appropriate options repaint using the same colors that are already on the building and the same color scheme propose a wellresearched color palette as described herein site considerations though these guidelines tend to focus on buildings their sites are also of importance as the land on which the buildings sit is part of the streetscape in planning for the building site whether planning a new building alterations or additions to an old one or just site improvements around an existing structure there are several things to keep in mind the site is a significant factor in the interpretation of a place because it is experienced at a variety of levels depending on the observer when walking past a building the scale of the facade dramatically changes in comparison with observation made from a vehicle conserving the views of and from a site view sheds are considered part of the preservation of a property landscaping consider landscaping as an important element of the building site well designed or wellplanned landscaping can have a positive impact less rather than more landscaping is the better choice too much vegetation near the structure may cause moisture problems for the building and can be hard to maintain keep vegetation 24 inches from the base of the building avoid obscuring picturesque views with too much landscaping the ideal approach to landscaping an historic property is to find historic photographs and see the approach originally taken with the property often owners are surprised to see the historic approach is within the budget and healthy for the building historically 19th century structures did not have abundant foundation plantings fences and walls fences and walls are traditionally used as boundary markers and security features while these elements are appropriate for kents residential areas and some commercial buildings consider using traditional types examples may include low masonry walls picket fences board fences wrought iron fences or fence rows of trees and shrubs on larger properties avoid nontraditional materials such as concrete or cyclone fencing and avoid nontraditional wood or vinyl fencing designs like basketweave shadowbox or stockade fences paint or an opaque stain is appropriate for wood fencing fences that are added to the front of the building should be limited in height but still be in scale with the building parking historically buildings were approached from the front or main entry it is difficult to provide enough parking to suit everyones desire to be close to the front door common parking areas or lots that do not interrupt the streetscape are a good approach to a difficult problem the zoning require a certain number of parking spots for most building types work with the zoningengineering department on the placement of parking try to avoid offthestreet parking in the front of buildings try creative uses of space some building uses may allow an owner to share parking with others for instance the synagogue needs parking on saturday and the church needs parking on sundaythey could use the same lot instead of building two decks sidewalk tables and patio areas may be more appropriate to historic commercial structures depending upon the actual building site than the contemporary vision of a wood deck a deck may be considered appropriate if it is shielded from public view by the structure and if it is constructed so that it can be removed in the future without damage to the structure large decks and patios should be limited to the rear of buildings wood decks should be kept low to the ground and finished with either paint or opaque stain to complement the colors of the historic building patios may be constructed of concrete brick slate stone pavers or other material that is compatible with the existing historic building in color and texture windmills and solar panels these items must not be visible from a public street demolition the demolition of existing historically or architecturally significant structures to accommodate new construction should be discouraged unless it can be demonstrated that the physical condition of the building has deteriorated significantly that a practical use of the building is not feasible or that the renovation of the building is economically impractical moving although moving a building is preferred over demolition moving is considered the last resort to save a structure because a buildings connection with its original site is a primary defining feature of the structures character separation from the site creates an interruption in the history and significance of the structure if the architectural review board permits the relocation of a structure the building should be placed on a site that resembles the original site  general guidelines in this section are for reference purposes and are intended to assist owners of historic properties in the maintenance of historic materials regular maintenance of a structure often prevents the need for costly repairs in the future when property owners apply for federal tax credits proper treatment of historic materials is required for these properties listed in the national register of historic places buildings that are located in the kent design overlay district require appropriate treatment to maintain the integrity of the historic districts the maintenance of an historic building should be fully evaluated before rushing to the local store for materials this approach will provide a more longterm remedy instead of just a quick patch proper planning can often save time effort and expense when repairs are necessary note the following general guidelines from this manual as based upon the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation the intention of repairs is not to make historic buildings look new but to preserve and protect the original materials some signs of aging contribute to the buildings character and retaining the character of the building is the purpose of these design guidelines likewise artificial aging should be avoided work performed on an historic structure should be carried out using the least intrusive and least destructive methods that will obtain the desired result damaged elements should be repaired rather than replaced where elements must be replaced utilize materials and methods that match the appearance and quality of the original as closely as possible the services of an architect experienced in historic building materials are often beneficial to the property owner note preservation briefs provided by the us department of the interior provide valuable information and guidance on maintenance and repair of historic properties and materials see appendix c process for repairs 1identify the problemidentify the location and extent of the perceived problem 2determine the cause of the problem carefully consider what may be the underlying cause of the problem 3treatment for the problemdetermine a treatment method to remedy the problem and repair the damage identify the problem identification of the problem is primarily done by observation problem areas most often appear different in color andor texture a visual survey of the entire building will provide a comprehensive list of conditions it is important to determine the extent of the problem including the depth of the deterioration and how large an area it encompasses determine the cause of the problem an unsightly or deteriorated area may only be an indicator of a more serious issue occurring in the structure that may not be clearly visible therefore determining the cause is usually more difficult than identifying the problem and requires more active investigation the cause of the problem must be resolved before the damage can be repaired  otherwise it may soon reoccur remember that problems inside the building are often indicative of a problem with the exterior walls roof or foundation frequent problem causes 1an underlying problem for example insect infestation in moist wood may have a related cause the roof leaked allowing the wood framing to become soaked inviting insects that reside in wet wood 2 inappropriate or inferior materials especially those from prior repairs are often more susceptible to failure than the buildings original fabric for instance repointing a 19th century building with a high cement content mortar will likely cause the masonry to crack which is an irreversible problem another example may be replacing a six inch copper gutter with a four inch aluminum one that has the potential to fail because it is too small to carry the water runoff  it also has the potential to fail because the dissimilar metals can result in galvanic action when they are connected increasing the opportunity for corrosion and leaking 3poor workmanship or installation can also be a source of problems for instance if the flashing is not properly installed on a roof valley water can seep into the building soaking interior walls or ceilings and may not be discovered until the plaster is so wet that it falls off the lath if the gutters are installed without a positive slope toward the downspout the building is at risk for ice dams in the winter and overflowing gutters in times of heavy rainfall treatments for the problem some conditions initially determined to be problems may not require repair if the condition has stabilized and it is not adversely affecting the structure in any way it is likely that no further work is necessary for instance if there was initial settlement at the time the building was erected but no further movement in the last 80 years there is probably nothing to warrant concern if the condition is worsening or the structure has been compromised repairs must be made to prevent further damage to the building for instance if the initial settlement was so drastic that the masonry cracked wythes of brick and the plaster allowing water to enter the building then perhaps there is reason for concern in light of the concept of lowest level of intervention possible the treatments should be considered in the order of least invasive first can we repair the crack inside can we repair the crack on the outside and repair the plaster on the inside must we replace the outside wythe of brick and repair the rest must we replace two wythes of brick and cut out the damaged plaster to replace that portion of the wall it should be understood that the least invasive methods are generally the best for the historic structure and the best as an economic approach to the work as well masonry brick and stone are two of the most durable historic building materials but they are still susceptible to damage caused by inappropriate repairs and cleaning methods reference preservation briefs 1 2 6 7 38 and 42 appendix c identify the problem indicators of problems in masonry include but are not limited to  images0004159jpgbulge in the wall  images0004159jpgcracks in the masonry  images0004159jpgopen joints  images0004159jpgdeteriorated or broken masonry  images0004159jpgdirt or stains discoloration determine the cause of the problem the majority of problems in masonry are caused by movement or moisture movement may be due to settlement of the building over time a weak foundation or compromised structural elements such as window and door headers movement can also be caused by the vibration of trucks passing by buildings located close to a road movement in a masonry building is most evident by a bulging wall or cracked masonry for example a step crack that extends from opening to opening to the top of the wall moisture can travel up walls action wicking run down walls from gravity or enter walls from the interior caused by a difference in temperature between the interior and exterior of the building excessive moisture is often present where masonry is deteriorated or broken it is often marked by a darker shade in color caused by dampness or a white haze caused by efflorescence salts that leach from the masonry dirt and staining are primarily an aesthetic concern and rarely cause damage to masonry exceptions to that statement include years of accumulated carbon deposits from industrial pollution and some forms of biological growth stains may include rust and copper from adjacent metals graffiti paint oil tar and organic matter such as moss and algae mortar repointing is most often necessary where masonry repairs are required mortar joints provide level bedding for masonry units to sit and will absorb stresses occurring in the masonry due to expansion contraction moisture migration and settlement the appearance of mortar joints also contributes to the aesthetic quality and character of the building reference preservation brief 2 appendix c identify the problem indicators of problems in mortar joints include but are not limited to  images0004159jpgdisintegrating mortar  images0004159jpgcracks in mortar or open mortar joints  images0004159jpgloose masonry units  images0004159jpgdamp walls  images0004159jpgdamaged finishes on interior determine the cause of the problem similar to masonry problems in mortar joints are often caused by structural movement moisture or improper mortar composition and placement the causes must be addressed prior to repointing treatment for the problem after addressing the cause of the problems the first step of beginning a re pointing project is to analyze the historic mortar to determine its physical and visual characteristics a sample of unweathered original mortar establishes the parameters for the new repointing mortar as defined herein if the building is an incomeproducing property for which the owner seeks tax credits or grants the mortar must be analyzed by a qualified lab to determine its composition repointing mortar  images0004159jpgshould match original in color texture and tooling sand defines the color and texture  images0004159jpgjoints should be raked out and cleaned so that the depth of the repointing mortar can be at least 112 times the joint width  images0004159jpgmust have greater vapor permeability than the masonry  images0004159jpgmust be at least as vapor permeable and soft as the original mortar  images0004159jpgmust be softer in compressive strength than the masonry visual examination along with a mortar analysis by a qualified laboratory will assist with satisfying each of these parameters matching the appearance of the original mortar joint is essential to maintaining the aesthetic quality of the structure a mortar analysis is particularly helpful in identifying the sand by gradation and color greater vapor permeability is required to prevent excessive moisture absorption in the brick which can show up as unattractive efflorescence on the surface or subflorescence below the surface which can damage the masonry causing pieces of brick to fall away known as spauling or delamination a mortar that is softer in compressive strength than the masonry allows for flexibility in the masonry system so that stresses within the building do not crack or break the masonry units repointing mortars typically should be custom mixed in order to match the characteristics of the original mortar traditional mortar was composed of lime putty sand and water portland cement was patented in great britain in 1824 and became commonly used in the united states in the early 20th century initially portland cement was used as an additive to speed the set time of the traditional mortar by the 1930s it became a main ingredient producing a harder mortar the significance of the difference in compressive strength between traditional and modern mortars is critical when working on an historic structure because of the damage that modern mortar can cause to the historic masonry in addition caulking is generally an inappropriate treatment for masonrytomasonry joints the integrity of the masonry wall and the historic structure is dependent upon proper successful repointing wood in response to rising concerns about fire safety by the end of the 19th century wood typically was limited to window frames and sashes storefronts ornament such as cornice details and framing within fireproof masonry and steel structures exposed wood was painted for protection sometimes wood supports and cornices were covered with sheet metal for aesthetic reasons wood has remained a popular building material because it is flexible performs well structurally in tension and compression and is easy to use wood however is most susceptible to moisture related

gray split wood determine the cause of the problem excessive moisture is the primary cause of deterioration in wood moisture can cause paint failure and facilitate fungi that cause decay and rot this makes wood susceptible to insects which feed on wet or rotting wood paint failure can occur when water that has infiltrated the wood cannot escape from the wood because the paint coating has created an impenetrable vapor barrier the water continues to try to escape until the coating fails allowing the moisture to be released decay also known as rot is caused by fungi that feast on wood signs of decay include areas of soft spongy crumbling and cracked wood fungus often grows center of a wood element and is therefore not readily visible decay may be identified by poking questionable areas with an ice pick or an awl  if the wood is decayed it will come up in short irregular pieces long fibrous splinters typically indicate the wood is sound conditions fungi require three conditions if any one of the three is not present decay can not survive though it can lay dormant until the three conditions are again present signs of fungi  images0004159jpgsuitable temperatures typically between 5090 f

consolidants and epoxy fillers strengthen and stabilize the damaged areas of wood this type of repair can be even stronger than wood and can be shaped and painted like the original wood damaged areas also may be replaced by patches of wood that match the original material and are installed by traditional methods such as a dutchman full replacement of wood members or elements is the extreme and should be done only when absolutely necessary steps for wood repair  images0004159jpgallow wood to be completely dry  images0004159jpgremove only damaged areas back to sound wood keep in mind that the

teak and mahogany are highly resistant to decay cypress redwood walnut white oak and locust are relatively resistant spruce red oak birch and poplar are more susceptible to decay and should not remain exposed when replacing wood in whole or in part it is essential to consider the original species so that the old and new elements will act in the same manner it is encouraged to research the origin of wood that you may be considering if the considered wood comes from an endangered rain forest it is encouraged to select a different origin of wood exterior paint the exteriors of historic buildings are painted for two primary reasons to protect and preserve exterior building materials and to create color schemes appropriate for their architectural style and articulation paint is a protective coating which aids in deterring the harmful effects of weathering such as moisture ultraviolet uv rays from the sun and wind paint requires maintenance and renewal to ensure a buildings longterm preservation and reapplication is necessary about every 58 years paint also enables the owner of an historic building to enhance the architectural style with original or appropriate period colors that can be applied for a relatively modest cost reference preservation briefs 10 and 37 appendix c identify the problem indicators of problems and types of paint failure include but are not limited to

resulting in deep open cracks determine the cause of the problem neglecting to correct the causes of paint failures and problems or neglecting to repair deteriorated exterior materials prior to repainting will cause new paint work to fail prematurely improper application of paint general weathering uv rays from the sun rain and wind the presence of excess moisture and moisture infiltration are the primary causes of paint failure leaking roofs deteriorated flashings leaking or missing gutters and downspouts and overgrown vegetation are the most common sources of excess moisture that affect exterior paint treatment for the problem it is important that a building be repainted before its paint fails and allows moisture to penetrate to the substrate causing the paint to deteriorate at an accelerated rate good surface preparation is the key to a longlasting finish  however it is not always necessary to remove paint to bare substrate before repainting removing all of the paint negates the ability to conduct analysis of historic colors as well as other information about the history of the property soiling staining mildew and chalking generally do not require paint removal and can be treated by thorough surface cleaning and preparation prior to repainting in most cases these conditions can be treated with the application of a mild nonionic detergent and scrubbing with clean water and naturalbristle brushes areas with mildew also should be treated with a bleach and water solution after cleaning rinse with lowpressure water garden hose pressuredo not use high pressure and allow the surface to thoroughly dry if rust stains are present remove rust from suspect metal surfaces and coat with rust inhibiting primer countersink exposed nail heads and fill with high quality wood filler crazing and blistering in most cases can be treated with limited paint removal scraping and light sanding hand or mechanical to a sound surface and properly repainting is the best method for repairing crazing and blistering although some hairline cracks and imperfections may translate new paint feathering down the high points and the application of an additional coat of primer in these areas may lessen the effects peeling cracking and alligatoring usually require paint removal down to sound substrate if these conditions are present only in the top layers they can be treated the same as crazing and blistering however if the conditions have progressed to bare wood and the paint has begun to fail it will need to be removed by scraping sanding heat guns or chemical strippers depending on the type of substrate and the particular area involved bare wood should be primed within 48 hours and then repainted open flame blow torches sandblasting or waterblasting must not be used to prepare a surface for repainting chemical methods may be used after testing trials prove to be successful and do not cause damage to substrates or adjacent materials care should be taken to rinse chemical residue from the surface prior to repainting or the paint will not properly adhere it is important to note that the least amount of water should be used for the paint removal process because it will be absorbed by the wood and may raise the wood grain or leach into the building always use the gentlest means possible based on the assumption that the exterior of the building has been painted with oil paint in the past it is recommended that a high quality oil based primer be applied first after the primer has thoroughly dried apply finish coats of either oilbased or 100% acrylic latex paint read the labels or ask the advice of a paint expert in order to determine the best quality paint with the least environmental impact regardless of what type of paint is ultimately

deterioration and failure include high concentrations of moisture and air pollution  wind  general neglect and abuse  poor original design detailing and installation  and failure of protective finish coats corrosion occurs rapidly when metals are exposed to moisture and air and it is exacerbated with the presence of high concentrations of airborne salts sulfur and other acid compounds galvanic corrosion is an electrochemical action that results when two dissimilar metals react together in the presence of an electrolyte such as water containing salts corrosion is accelerated in situations where architectural details provide pockets or crevices to trap and hold liquid corrosive agents and where protective finishes have deteriorated physical deterioration such as failed seams and connections and fatigue are usually caused by a combination of environmental conditions physical stresses and insufficient design details treatment for the problem protect architectural metals from deterioration by maintaining protective finishes providing proper drainage and preventing water from standing on horizontal surfaces or accumulating in curved decorative features suitable treatments for metals include cleaning and maintenance repair and selective replacement cleaning and maintenance clean ferrous metals or aluminum to remove corrosion prior to repainting or applying other appropriate protective coatings do not remove historic patinas found on some metals such as copper or bronze as this will diminish the metals historic character and may accelerate deterioration

rehabilitation tax credit is available for historic buildings listed in the national register of historic places either individually or as part of a registered historic district to use the credit a building must be income producing  used for industrial commercial office or residential rental purposes  the rehabilitation much be substantial  must cost at least as much as the adjusted basis in the property or $5000 whichever is greater  and the rehabilitation work must be certified as complying with the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation the historic rehabilitation tax credit is a credit of 20% of the cost of the buildings rehabilitation and is taken as a credit against federal income taxes owed by the buildings owner therefore the tax credit is the same as a 20% discount on the cost of rehabilitation the acquisition cost of the building cannot be counted as part of the amount on which the credit is taken nor may the cost of additions or enlargements to the building when rehabilitation is complete the depreciable basis of the property must be reduced by the amount of the credit because building owners tax situations can vary anyone considering use of the historic rehabilitation tax credit should consult a tax advisor before proceeding staff members at the ohio historic preservation office are available to answer questions regarding the certification process overview of the national register of historic places the national register of historic places is the nations list of properties recognized by the national park service us department of the interior as being worthy of preservation for their local state or national significance they must be significant in areas of american history architecture archeology engineering or culture the program in ohio is administered by the ohio historic preservation office of the ohio historical society in general properties eligible for the national register should be at least 50 years old retain their historic integrity and meet at least one of the four national register criteria benefits of listing in the national register include recognition of its significance which can lead to greater awareness of appreciation for the property  eligibility for use of the 20% historic rehabilitation tax credit  and a certain level of protection of federally funded or assisted projects that might have an adverse impact on the property additionally some funding programs use the national register listing as a prerequisite for funding the national register does not prevent the owner of the listed property from maintaining repairing altering selling or even demolishing the property with other than federal funds it does not obligate the owner to make repairs or improvement to the property nor does it automatically make it subject to local design review for more information about the national register program contact the ohio historic preservation office an inspection checklist what to look

guidelines purpose and applicability the purpose of the sign design guidelines is to provide design criteria to be utilized in the design and construction of signage in the city of kent as such the goal is to encourage creative design while at the same time seeking to encourage compatibility with other signage and building facades these guidelines shall be utilized for signage in all areas of the city to the extent feasible however in areas where specific guidelines with regard to building and sign design may be applicable as designated in of the zoning those specific guidelines may be mandatory and shall supersede the guidelines recommended in this appendix design elements these guidelines attempt to address design elements relative to signage in regard to general design compatibility colors materials legibility and scale as well as lighting and illumination while it may not be possible to address each and every design element with a given sign the design of the sign should utilize the criteria set forth within these guidelines to the extent possible sign compatibility creative designsigns should make a positive contribution to the general appearance of the street and commercial area in which they are to be located the city encourages imaginative and innovative design of signage as long as it is compatible with its immediate surroundings and adjacent properties size and scalewithin the parameters otherwise permitted in this zoning the scale of signage should be appropriate for the building on which it is located as well as the surrounding site and properties adjacent to it integrationsigns attached directly to the buildings should not obscure or cover significant architectural features the signs should also blend well with the design of the building both in style materials and color schemes in buildings where there are multiple tenants signs should complement and enhance each other impactsignage should be designed and located in a manner so that they have little or no impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods such signs should generally be smaller scale and less intrusive with regard to lighting color and design placementwalls signs should be placed in a manner where they establish an integrated rhythm form and scale with adjacent signage this can be accomplished by maintaining compatible size and placement so that signs generally align at similar heights on the faade pedestrian scalesignage should contain some pedestrianoriented information as part of the permitted signage at a facility such signage should be oriented so that it is easily seen and read by pedestrians standing adjacent to the business individual letterslettering attached directly to a building may be used in place of an integrated sign structure as long as the lettering compliments the design and form of the building colors selectioncolor combinations should be selected and used in a manner that makes the sign attractive and blend well with its surroundings the use of colors can be effective in catching the eye of the reader and communicating feelings and ideas the use of too many colors can create confusion and detract from the message of the sign color palettes should compliment the structure and the project as a whole contrastcontrast in coloring is important in considering the legibility of signs there should be substantial contrast between the lettering and the background to make the sign easier to read both in welllit and poorly lit situations light letters on dark backgrounds or dark letters on light backgrounds are the most legible multiple colorssigns of multiple colors should be designed with consideration given to legibility and whether they detract from the visibility and identification of adjacent signage multicoloring should be limited in scale and not overpower the sign on which it is placed or adjacent signage materials typesthe following materials are recommended for building mounted signs woodcarved sandblasted etched and properly sealed primed and painted or stained metalformed etched cast engraved and properly primed and painted or factory coated to protect against corrosion plasticplastic materials are only recommended when the use of such materials is colored or otherwise finished in a way where it compliments the architectural style of the building neonneon tubing in the form of graphics or lettering may be used if it compliments the architectural style of the building clothpaperthe use of cloth or paper materials are generally not acceptable for exterior signage other than for awnings there are no limitations on the types of materials used for ground mounted signs or pole mounted signs as long as the materials compliment the building and site on which the signage is located as well as those on adjacent properties compatibilitysign materials should be compatible with the design of the building face on which they are located materials should not detract from the legibility of the sign for example glossy finishes may be difficult to read in high glare situations sign legibility signs should effectively communicate the message for which they are intended legibility of the content of a sign is of extreme importance letter sizingletter sizing should be determined by the nature of the sign and its intended audience pedestrian oriented signage which is typically viewed at shorter distances should have smaller lettering generally ranging in size from 3 to 6 signage which is to be viewed from the highway should be sized based on the distance from the highway and the legally traveled speed on the highway permit applicants should justify the size of their signage and its lettering based on these concepts the architectural review board andor the community development department may request documentation from the sign permit applicant regarding the size of a sign and its lettering and may refuse to grant an approval for such signage where the letter size cannot be justified messagingthe message being conveyed on a sign should be as brief and clearly stated as possible fewer words are generally more effective in communication and in legibility sign designers should consider the content carefully to determine what is minimally necessary to convey the advertising message spacingletters and words should not be spaced too closely since the crowding of letters will make a sign more difficult to read conversely letters should not be overspaced to the point where the reader has to read each letter individually unless otherwise limited in of this zoning code lettering should not occupy more than 75% of the sign panel area symbols  logossymbols and logos may be used on a sign to convey a message as long as the size and nature of the symbol  logo compliments the overall size and design of the sign font stylesit is generally recommended that the number of font styles be limited to the smallest number needed font styles that are difficult to read including intricate type faces andor cursive are discouraged especially on highway oriented signage sign illumination sign illumination should be carefully considered when planning any sign the illumination method can compliment a signs message or compromise its effectiveness improper illumination can also cause a hazard to public safety necessitythe sign designer  user should consider the necessity of providing additional lighting to illuminate the sign signage on windows may benefit from internal building lighting and may not need additional lighting exterior signs may benefit from ambient street lighting as a source of illumination energy usesign lighting should use timing mechanisms wherever possible to reduce the consumption of power if possible sign lighting should be turned off when the business is closed or during early morning hours between  am and  am when vehicular and pedestrian traffic is limited sourcesigns may be internally lit or directly lit by spotlights so long as such lighting does not shine brightly offsite on private or public property direct lighting will often highlight a sign in relation to the building architecture and compliment the architectural features such lighting should be the minimum necessary to adequately illuminate the sign direct light sources should be shielded to prevent glare and light pollution onto adjoining residential properties the city may require a photometric lighting plan as part of a sign permit or comprehensive sign plan application title seven subdivision regulations chap 1177 general provisions

ecologically friendly approach to site development and storm water management that aims to mitigate development impacts to land water and air the approach emphasizes the integration of site design and planning techniques that conserve natural systems and hydrologic functions on a site impact development site design and strategies may provide the means by which storm water management objectives may be achieved the goals of low impact development include 1incorporating natural topographic features wetlands stream corridors mature forests and constraints in site design  2maintaining site hydrologic functions and mitigate impacts to such functions  3providing alternative layout and sizing of traditional site  4maintaining the total number of buildable lots within a development lot yield  5customizing infrastructure lots streets curbs gutters sidewalks to each site  6decentralizing and micromanaging storm water at its source  and 7providing of aesthetically pleasing storm water management controls  bmaintaining natural function and mitigating impact to the hydrologic cycle of a site allows for greater protection of the water resources of the site this benefits the health safety and welfare of local stakeholders by controlling storm water at its source and minimizing the nonpoint source pollution that results in water resource degradation  cif there are any conflicts between provisions of other sections of the kent codified ordinances then sections of shall control passed 32013 120302 waiving of site requirements ato encourage the use of low impact development techniques the planning commission is empowered to waive or otherwise modify other requirements such modifications of these requirements shall only be to the extent necessary to provide for and encourage the use of low impact development techniques as described in this chapter and may be done only upon the recommendation of the director  bany waiver in site requirements for low impact development standards shall in no way be construed as a waiver of all requirements of the aforementioned articles therefore whenever the planning commission allows deviation from the presumptive requirements set forth in the zoning and subdivision codes chapters it shall enter on the face of the development permit the low impact development site design standards andor techniques that it accepts in lieu of meeting the standard set forth in the aforementioned articles and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation passed 32013 120303 low impact development standards athe use of low impact development standards may provide developers with flexibility in site design and numerous environmental and economic benefits the following site design elements should be considered in low impact development 1reduce limits of clearing and grading the limits of clearing and grading refer to the site area to which development is directed this development area includes all impervious areas roads sidewalks and rooftops and pervious areas graded lawn areas and open drainage systems ato minimize hydrologic impacts on existing site land cover the area of development should be located 1in less sensitive areas or areas with lower value in terms of hydrologic function eg developing barren clay soils will have less hydrologic impact than development of forested sandy soils 2outside of sensitive area buffers such as streams floodways floodplains wetlands and steep slopes 3outside of areas with soils which have high infiltration rates to reduce net hydrologic site impacts badditionally minimal disturbance techniques may be employed to further reduce the limits of clearing and grading by restricting ground disturbance by identifying the smallest possible area and clearly delineating it on the site these techniques include 1reduce paving and compaction of highly permeable soils  2minimizing the size of construction easements and material storage areas during the construction phase of a development  3avoid removal of existing trees where possible and specifically those trees over 18 inches in diameter  4minimizing imperviousness by reducing the total area of paved surfaces  5disconnecting as much impervious area as possible to increase opportunities for infiltration and reduce water runoff flow  6maintaining existing topography and associated drainage divides to encourage natural dispersed flow paths 2drainage as a design element to reduce impacts created by land development site planning should incorporate drainage by carefully conducting hydrologic evaluations and reviewing spatial site layout options these procedures should be incorporated into the site planning process early on to understand and take advantage of site conditions hydrologic evaluation procedures can be used to minimize runoff potential and to maintain the predevelopment time of concentration open drainage systems should be designed within natural landforms and land uses to become major design elements of a site plan or development plan the storm water management drainage system can suggest pathway alignment optimum locations for open space and potential building development sites the drainage system helps to integrate urban forms giving the development an integral more aesthetically pleasing relationship to the natural features of the site not only does the integrated site plan complement the land but it can also save on development costs by minimizing earthwork and construction of expensive drainage structures 3minimize impervious surfaces the entire traffic distribution network roadways sidewalks driveways and parking areas are the greatest source of impervious area changes in the impervious area alter runoff recharge values and site hydrology managing the imperviousness contributed by road and parking area pavement is an important component of the site planning and design process an appropriate strategy may avoid problems from runoff and water table depletion by reducing such surfaces that prevent natural filtration methods that can be used to achieve a reduction in the total runoff volume from impervious surfaces are presented below aalternative roadway layouts  bnarrow road width road sections can be used to reduce total site imperviousness as well as clearing and grading impacts by using the rural residential road section in place of the primary residential section the width of paving may be reduced the rural section also eliminates the use of concrete curb and gutter which reduces construction costs substantially and facilitates the use of vegetated roadside swales creduced application of sidewalks to one side of primary roads total site imperviousness can also be reduced by limiting sidewalks to one side of primary roads dreduced onstreet parking reducing onstreet parking requirements to one side or even elimination of onstreet parking altogether has the potential to reduce road surfaces and therefore overall site imperviousness twosided parking requirements may be unnecessary to provide adequate parking facilities for each lot erooftops rooftops contribute to site imperviousness and the number of lots per acre or lot coverage generally determines the sites rooftop impervious area house type shape and size can affect rooftop imperviousness vertical construction two story is favored over horizontal layouts ranchstyle to reduce the square footage of rooftops fvegetative roof systems moss grass herbs wildflowers and native plants may be used to create a lightweight and aesthetically pleasing permeable vegetative surface on an impervious roof area gdriveways driveways are another element of the site plan that can be planned to reduce the total site imperviousness some techniques that can be used include 1using shared driveways whenever possible but especially in sensitive areas 2limiting driveway width to nine 9 feet for both single and shared driveways 3minimizing building setbacks to reduce driveway length 4using driveway and parking area materials which reduce runoff and increase travel times such as pervious pavers or gravel hpermeable pavement surfaces a variety of materials ranging from traditional asphalt and concrete gravel or pavers may be used to construct these surfaces these roadways or parking areas must allow water to flow replenishing the soil areas directly beneath the subbase underneath these permeable pavements must be engineered to accommodate temporary water storage and filtration 4minimize directly connected impervious areas additional environmental benefits can be achieved and hydrologic impacts reduced by disconnecting unavoidable impervious areas strategies for accomplishing this include adisconnecting roof drains and directing flows to vegetated detention areas bdirecting flows from impervious paved areas to stabilized vegetated areas cbreaking up flow directions from large paved surfaces dencouraging sheet flow areas ecarefully locating impervious areas so that they drain to natural systems vegetated buffers natural resource areas or infiltratable soils 5modify drainage flow paths the time of concentration in conjunction with hydrologic site conditions determines the peak discharge rate for a storm event site and infrastructure components such as travel distance flow path  slope of the ground surface andor water surface  surface roughness  and channel shape pattern and material components can affect the time of concentration techniques that can affect and control the time of concentration can be incorporated into site design by managing flow and conveyance systems within the development site amaximize overland sheet flow  bincrease and lengthen flow paths  clengthen and flatten site and lot slopes  dmaximize use of open swale systems  eincrease and augment site and lot vegetation  bin order to reduce the volume of storm water runoff and decentralize flows a basic strategy incorporating the following low impact development practices and techniques should be integrated in the overall site design 1open swales these may serve as alternatives to curb and gutter systems grass or other vegetation should be used to reduce runoff velocity and allow filtration while channeling high volume flows safely away aplantings check dams and other similar features may be incorporated to further reduce velocity and increase filtration  bwalkways shall be separated from roadways by such swales or relocated to another area  cplant species used shall be selected for their tolerance to salt 2rain gardens these areas provide storage for excess storm water to collect and filter into the soil typical components of these gardens include grass buffers sand beds a ponding area for excess runoff storage organic layers and planting soil and vegetation athey shall be located on site away from any structures andor roadways  bdownspouts should be directed towards such rain gardens  cpermanent ponds may be incorporated into the design of the garden  dtemporary storage areas without ponds may be used  esuch areas shall be landscaped with native plants and grasses  fplantings shall be selected according to their ability to tolerate pollutants  gannual maintenance guarantees must be provided for these areas in the site plan or development plan 3filter strips these areas are designed to collect flow from large impervious surfaces parking lots et cetera they may direct water into vegetated detention areas or special sand filters that capture pollutants and gradually discharge the water 4cisternsrain barrels acisterns are designed to store storm water for irrigation during dry periods rather than channeling it away cistern collection systems may be designed to be installed beneath permeable pavement areas allowing for maximum storage capacity brain barrels are smaller and are designed to collect individual residential storm water from roof
