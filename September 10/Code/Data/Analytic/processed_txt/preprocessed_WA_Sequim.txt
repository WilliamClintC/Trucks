and related activities to promote health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city of sequim and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location of sexuallyoriented businesses within the city it is not the intent of the city that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to impose a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexuallyoriented materials similarly it is not the intent of the city that it should be the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexuallyoriented materials protected by the state or federal constitutions or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexuallyoriented material to their intended market neither is it the intent of the city that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials   findings based upon a wide range of evidence presented to the sequim city council and to other jurisdictions including but not limited to the testimony of law enforcement officers and members of public and on other evidence information publications articles studies documents case law and material submitted to and reviewed and considered by the city council and staff the councils of other cities within the region and in other jurisdictions nonprofit organizations and other legislative bodies the city council makes the following findings acertain conduct occurring on premises offering sexuallyoriented business creates secondary impacts that are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such conduct must be regulated as provided herein bregulation of the sexuallyoriented business industry or licensing is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred cproximity between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances can facilitate sexual contact prostitution and related crimes concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the city which demand reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health safety and general welfare dit is necessary to license entertainers in the sexuallyoriented industry to prevent the exploitation of minors to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible ethe evidence supporting the need to protect minors and families from the criminal and other unlawful activities associated with the operation of sexuallyoriented businesses is compelling the provisions of this chapter are necessary to ensure that sexuallyoriented uses in sequim are conducted a reasonable distance away from places where minors regularly gather often in large numbers fit is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of sexuallyoriented businesses at such times as such establishments are offering sexuallyoriented business so there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees gthe license fees required herein are nominal fees imposed as necessary cost recoupment measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the sexuallyoriented businesses and in increased police costs in enforcement henterprises providing sexuallyoriented businesses are increasingly associated with ongoing prostitution disruptive conduct and other criminal activity such businesses are currently not subject to effective regulation and constitute an immediate threat to the public peace health and safety the hours of operation of such businesses have a significant impact on the occurrence of illegal drug transactions and other criminal activities idue to the information presented regarding the connection of prostitution with sexuallyoriented businesses there is concern over sexuallytransmitted diseases which is a legitimate health concern of the city and thus requires regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses in order to protect the health safety and well being of the public jmany cities including seattle and tacoma have experienced negative secondary impacts from sexuallyoriented business land uses the skid row effect is one of these secondary impacts and is evident in certain parts of seattle such an effect would be significantly magnified in sequim due to the difference in size and characteristics of the city kthe city of sequim may rely on the experiences and studies of other cities counties and organizations in assessing the need for regulation of sexuallyoriented business uses operations and licensing lthe city takes notice of studies and experiences of other cities and counties in combating the specific adverse impacts of sexuallyoriented businesses mregulation of sexuallyoriented businesses should be developed to prevent deterioration andor degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists rather than in response to an existing problem nincreased levels of criminal activities occur in the vicinity of sexuallyoriented businesses additionally hidden ownership interests for the purpose of skimming profits avoiding payment of taxes and racketeering have historically occurred in sexuallyoriented businesses in the absence of regulations othe city council therefore finds that the protection and the preservation of the public health safety and welfare requires establishment of this chapter pthere are sufficient important and substantial government interests to provide a constitutional basis for reasonable regulation of time place and manner under which sexuallyoriented businesses can operate qit is not the intent of this chapter to unconstitutionally suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution nor of the washington state constitution but to enact contentneutral ordinances which address the secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses as well as the health problems associated with such businesses rin a family community sexuallyoriented businesses are not uniformly compatible with community standards as defined during the numerous public hearings sthe law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by sexuallyoriented businesses are limited and are best conserved by regulating and licensing sexuallyoriented businesses and those associated with them tin order

materialscolors proposed for the project including but not limited to field or base colors trim colors accent colors and colors of natural materials the field or base color is one of the most dominating features of the building  trim colors are used on the buildings secondary features while accent colors can emphasize the finer more characteristic elements of the buildings design typically no more than three distinct colors should be used in one building but additional colors may be considered if they are close shades of one of the other three colors 1field or base colors when more than one base color is proposed the hues of each color shall be analogous or next to each other on the paint manufacturers color wheel the lightdark values and color saturations of each base color shall be

colors except whites and achromatic gray colors gray made from black and white only may be of any lightdark value for example the base color might be spanish green a light muted green from the blueyellow family and the trim color might be maroon a deep reddish brown from the redblue family as long as the two colors complement each other in their brightness and intensity 3accent colors can be of different lightdark values than base or trim colors accent colors can be brighter than field or trim colors accent colors shall be used with restraint appropriate areas for accent colors are those details that might otherwise go unnoticed such as moldings or molding indentations medallions and shadow lines roof windows and door frames doors are also an appropriate location for accent colors 4natural material colors natural materials such as stones clay masonries splitfaced concrete masonry cedar and redwood have intrinsically pleasing hues values and saturations of color these

chromatic or achromatic grey the colors shall have lightdark values and color saturations similar to the structures base colors color restrictions apply to flat or lowpitched roofs only when the parapet or other screening device does not fully conceal the roofing surface from view exh b    landscaping and buffering aguideline development should ensure that the parking lighting circulation and landscaping aspects are welldesigned with regard to safety efficiency and convenience for vehicles bicycles pedestrians and transit both within the development and to and from surrounding areas landscaping and buffering should contribute to visual quality and continuity within and between developments provide screening and mitigation of potential conflicts between activity areas and site elements enhance outdoor spaces reduce erosion and stormwater runoff and mitigate air pollution landscaping that incorporates low impact development strategies for stormwater management should be considered as a way to meet the policies of the city of sequims adopted stormwater management plan and be consistent with every reasonable effort should be made to preserve existing trees if
