ethical principles or practice ethical behavior  8 when they observe serious unethical practices discourage the unethical behavior and promptly disclose it to the appropriate authorities and encourage others to do the same  and 9 ensure that those for whose performance they are responsible are aware of the minimum standards of ethics below which their conduct cannot fall without the risk of

the subdivision plan and meet the specifications for construction of driveways abutting town highways as outlined in town ordinances for purposes of this subsection the term usable frontage means frontage from which the applicant can demonstrate the availability of safe legal and technically feasible vehicular access for purposes of this subsection vehicular access will be deemed technically feasible if the applicant demonstrates that a paved driveway could reasonably be installed in accordance with subsection b below from the lots frontage to an interior location at which a home or other principal building could properly be constructed if vehicular access from any lots road frontage would require crossing a wetland or watercourse the applicant must obtain a permit for such crossing from the town of portland inland wetlands and watercourses agency in order to demonstrate that the access is usable if the applicant plans to use this access point b driveway location in order to comply with subsection a above the potential driveway location used to demonstrate that the lot frontage is usable must comply with the applicable provisions of the regulations for public improvements and meet the specifications for construction of driveways abutting town highways as outlined in town ordinances in addition no such driveway shall be located within 75 feet of the intersection of two

generally square or rectangular shapes are preferred unusual shapes should be avoided where feasible for purposes of this subsection the term lots with unusual shapes includes but is not limited to lots that are generally nonrectangular narrow lots eg lots having one dimension eg length more than three times the perpendicular dimension eg width the commission may require subdivision plans to be modified to eliminate or reduce the number of unusual lot shapes if it finds that such shapes are not necessary to allow a reasonable use of the land to be subdivided however nothing in this section shall prohibit the commission from approving one or more lots with unusual shapes or irregular lot lines if the commission finds that such shapes or lot lines will best fulfill the purposes set forth in or these regulations for example if the commission finds that such shapes or lot lines will help protect or define desirable open space or conservation areas f lot numbers all lots shall be numbered beginning with the numeral 1 and shall continue consecutively throughout the entire subdivision with no omissions or duplications no fractions or letters shall be used even in the case of resubdivisions in which case numbers of a higher order such as 101 or 1001 should be used adjoining subdivisions and sections of a subdivision having the same title shall not duplicate numbers but shall continue the sequence of numbers previously used for the adjoining land all of the lot numbers shall be conspicuous and noted on the map in the approximate center of the lots g open space in approving or modifying and approving any subdivision plan the commission shall require the provision of open spaces parks and playgrounds in locations deemed proper by the commission the following standards criteria and procedures shall apply to each subdivision application 1 purpose of open space a setaside of open space may be necessary or desirable to achieve a variety of objectives including the preservation of significant natural resources including wetlands and waterrelated resources as well as other environmentally important or sensitive lands and soils  the protection of scenic vistas and of historically and culturally 15 significant sites and features  and the provision of additional opportunities for passive or active recreation 2 need for open space subdivisions may create the need for additional open spaces parks and playgrounds both by increasing the population density in local areas thereby generating additional demand for such resources  and by producing additional environmental impacts alteration removal and destruction of natural cultural or historic resources and the establishment of additional sources of potential pollution thereby requiring the amelioration of local impacts preservation and protection of certain portions of the land in determining the proper location amount and type of open space to be provided in any subdivision the commission shall consider the nature and scope of the impacts the subdivision is likely to generate 3 amount of open space to be reserved the commission has determined that on average a setaside of up to twenty percent of the land area of a subdivision represents a fair balance between the burdens to be created by the additional development as described in subsection 32g2 and the land to be required for open spaces parks or playgrounds to compensate for or ameliorate those burdens therefore except as may otherwise be provided in these regulations a subdivision applicant must propose an openspace set aside of up to twenty percent of the area of the subdivision setasides of less than twenty percent may be most appropriate when the land to be dedicated would otherwise be suitable for building purposes as opposed to land that is subject to natural development restrictions such as but not limited to wetlands or watercourses steep slopes rocky soils or other factors that make such land inherently more suited to conservation or passive uses the commission shall not be bound by the applicants proposal either as to the amount or location of the suggested open space area if it finds that the specific physical conditions and circumstances of the subdivision require a greater or different area to be set aside 4 factors for determining the location of the open space setaside in determining whether to accept or modify any proposed location for an openspace setaside the commission shall consider 16 a the physical character and quality of the proposed open space in terms of its value for active or passive recreation including the ability to provide reasonable access to such areas  b the existence of and need to protect any significant natural cultural agricultural or historic resources on the site  c the special significance of any of the land in the subdivision to scenic or historic vistas worthy of preservation  d the existence location and function of any open space areas on abutting parcels and the opportunity to connect the new open spaces to such areas  e recommendations in the plan of conservation and development  and by the conservation commission  f the opportunity to preserve or protect significant natural resources  g accessibility of the open space  h any other relevant factors that may be brought to its attention by any person during the course of the commissions proceedings on the subdivision application 5 percentage of subdivision area to be set aside each subdivision plan submitted for approval by the commission must indicate a proposed openspace area having a percentage based on the criteria stated in subsection 32g3 above unless one or more of the following circumstances exist a feeinlieu of open space the minimum setaside may be reduced or eliminated if the applicant proposes a feeinlieu of open space in accordance with cgs b transfer of other land the minimum setaside may be reduced or eliminated if the applicant proposes to transfer other land to the town of portland in accordance with cgs in lieu of providing open space within the subdivision itself 17 c potential for substantial resubdivision the minimum setaside may be reduced or eliminated if the subdivision as proposed would create fewer than fifty percent of the number of lots that could reasonably and practically be created in accordance with the lot densities allowed under the zoning regulations and the physical conditions of the land  ie if one or more future resubdivisions could reasonably be expected to result in more than two times the number of lots presently proposed in such circumstances the commission may reduce the setaside requirement on a proportional or roughly proportional basis for example if the applicant is proposing to create only thirty percent of the number of lots that could reasonably be created from the parcel to be subdivided the commission may accept a proposal to dedicate only three to six percent of the total area as open space for the current application however in order to avoid piecemeal dedication of small less valuable openspace areas the proposed subdivision plan must still designate a single area of up to twenty percent of the parcel to accommodate both the presently proposed open space setaside and any future openspace areas that could ultimately be set aside upon resubdivision d existing open space restrictions the minimum setaside may be reduced or eliminated if the property being subdivided is already subject to conservation or preservation restrictions that serve a purpose similar in nature to those described in subsection 32g1 and that would not be subject to termination or revocation by any one or more property owners in the subdivision or by lapse of time e parcels smaller than ten acres the minimum setaside may be reduced or eliminated if the parent parcel is smaller than ten acres f lack of benefit the minimum setaside may be reduced or eliminated if the commission finds that a setaside would not reasonably serve any of the purposes listed in subsection 32g1 whether because of the character of the land to be subdivided the uses of the surrounding area or other reasons the commission shall not reduce or eliminate the minimum setaside under this subsection 32g5f unless it states on the record its reasons for finding that such dedication would not serve any of the purposes listed in g1 18 g commission discretion nothing in subsections 32g5a g5f shall be deemed to require the commission to accept any specific proposal to dedicate less than ten percent of the land in a proposed subdivision for openspace purposes the commission may approve modify and approve or deny any such proposal in accordance with its findings as to the manner and extent to which the proposed dedication would meet or conflict with the standards and criteria of this g 6 manner of dedicating open space areas designated as open space shall generally be proposed for dedication to the town of portland however the commission may accept a dedication in any one or more of the following manners if it finds that such alternate form of dedication would accomplish the purposes of this g and further provided that the legal status of the dedicated area as open space cannot be terminated without the express written consent of the town of portland 1 the open space may be dedicated to the town of portland by deed  2 the open space may be made subject to a conservation easement or similar form of protection such easement or protection to be in favor of the town of portland as grantee or beneficiary  3 the open space may be conveyed to a nonprofit land conservation trust or corporation  4 the open space may be owned in common by lot owners in the development provided any restrictions on access to the open space are found to be consistent with the purposes of this g suitable legal agreements for any acceptable manner of dedication must be approved in form and content by the commission and its legal counsel 7 use of open space land open space land shall be preserved in its natural state except as the commission may otherwise approve to accommodate designated conservation or recreational purposes with the approval of the commission structures and facilities for recreational purposes such as graded trails signage and parking areas may be constructed except as the commission may expressly approve in accordance with specific plans open space land shall not be used for 19 the storage of equipment or deposition of debris and shall not be excavated filled or regraded and trees and shrubs shall not be removed 8 access to designated open space any dedication of open space shall include a lawful route of access to such area consistent with the purposes of the dedication when applicable the commission may require an applicant to provide a rightofway for public access to open space areas that do not abut a public street the area of such rightofway shall not be included in the required open space area the rightofway shall be at least twenty 20 feet wide but not greater than fifty 50 feet wide the commission may require that such rightofway be leveled off and surfaced in a manner suitable for foot traffic or vehicular traffic h interior existing subdivisions the maximum number of interior lots allowed shall be in accordance with the following table 1 number of interior total number of  3 lots 1 interior lot 4  19 lots 2 interior lots 20  24 lots 3 interior lots more than 24 lots 1 additional interior lot for every 5 lots whenever a resubdivision involves a parent parcel from which one or more interior lots were previously created the foregoing table shall be applied to the total number of lots that have cumulatively been created from such parent parcel for example if a parent parcel that was subdivided into four lots included two interior lots and the landowner of the remaining area proposed to resubdivide it to create four more lots no additional interior lots would be permitted because the cumulative number of lots created from the parent parcel would be only eight new or unbuilt subdivisions are exempt from the lot number restrictions 2 landscaping of interior permanent continuous landscaped buffer strip shall be provided on the interior lot excluding the access strip set back at least twenty 20 feet from any lot line shared by a front lot and an interior lot at least 50% of the required plantings shall consist of evergreen species at least six 6 feet in height and 15 inches in caliper unless existing trees and shrubs possibly augmented by additional 20 plantings would provide an equivalent amount of privacy the initial buffer strip landscaping shall be provided by the developer prior to the sale of any interior lot created by subdivision the landscaping shall thereafter be maintained by the owner of the interior lot and a restrictive covenant noting the obligation shall be recorded on any deed of conveyance of such lot a notice of such restrictive covenant shall also be filed in the land records of the town prior to endorsement of any record subdivision map 3 zoning requirements the zoning regulations of the town of portland may contain other requirements for the use of interior lots any such requirements must also be met in order for an interior lot to be approved in a proposed subdivision i conservation subdivisions to the extent authorized by the zoning regulations the commission may approve a conservation subdivision subject to the following standards and criteria 1 the parcel to be subdivided must be no less than five acres in area 2 a minimum of 33% of the property to be subdivided must be set aside as open space 3 the following land characteristics

necessary to continue a public street to adjoining property upon future development of that property design of subdivision improvements a regulations for public improvements in addition to all other provisions of these subdivision regulations the commission hereby adopts and incorporates by reference herein the regulations for public improvements as those regulations may pertain or be relevant to any activities proposed in a subdivision plan including without limitation streets drainage landscaping and sediment and erosion control measures b water supply 1 general requirements the proposed subdivision design must be proved capable of accommodating all infrastructure needed to supply potable water to each lot each lot to which a public water supply is not available must be designed to accommodate an onsite potable water supply if historic geologic or other available information or data indicate that onsite water supplies may not be readily available due to pollution or other subsurface conditions the commission may require the applicant to install a test well or wells in order prove that a suitable water supply can be obtained the applicant must also prove that sufficient water supplies 22 eg hydrants fire tanks are available to provide timely and adequate firefighting capacity within the subdivision 2 public water supplies the commission shall require public water supply connections or extensions to be made available to each undeveloped lot in a subdivision if any portion of the parcel to be subdivided is located within 200 feet of an existing legally available public water supply system the developer shall be required to install a lateral water line to the lot line the lateral water line shall enter the lot at a point which is approximately at the center of the lot frontage unless the lot is shaped such that the house foundation would require the lateral service at a different point on the lot frontage c sewage disposal 1 general requirements the proposed subdivision design must be proved capable of accommodating all infrastructure needed to safely and lawfully dispose of sewerage each lot to which a public sewerage system is not available must be capable of accommodating an onsite sewage disposal system and required reserve area in accordance with good engineering practice the applicable requirements of the public health any other

the public sewer system the applicant shall be required to install the sanitary sewer line to the lot line for each lot in the subdivision d drainage facilities the proposed subdivision design must be proved to provide for adequate surfacewater and subsurface drainage including the upgrading of any downstream ditch culvert or other drainage structure which introduction of additional drainage due to the proposed subdivision would become undersized and create the potential for flooding on any public street in areas contiguous to brooks rivers or other bodies of water subject to flooding including tidal flooding proper provision must be made for protective flood control measures 23 e existing streets whenever any subdivision abuts an existing public street having a rightofway less than fifty feet wide a strip of land abutting the existing rightofway must be deeded to the town to increase the width of the street rightofway the minimum width of the strip of land to be deeded to the town for these purposes shall be onehalf the difference between the existing width of the street rightofway and the road width required by of the regulations for public improvements f new streets in addition to the applicable requirements of the regulations for public improvements the following criteria and standards shall be applied to new streets or extensions of existing streets in a proposed subdivision 1 general design principles proposed streets must be in harmony with existing or proposed thoroughfares shown in the plan of conservation and development or otherwise established or determined by the commission especially in regard to safe intersections with such thoroughfares proposed streets must be so arranged and of such width as to provide an adequate and convenient system for both present and prospective traffic needs 2 solar access where new or extended streets are proposed an eastwest street layout if feasible is generally preferred to provide the optimum building orientation for solar access especially for smaller lot sizes however eastwest street layouts may be reasonably avoided if they would produce undesirable gradients or excessive disruption of the natural topography 3 intersections see of the regulations for public improvements also road block lengths shall generally not exceed 1200 feet nor be less than 600 feet 4 deadend streets in addition to the requirements set forth in the regulations for public improvements the following criteria shall apply to proposed deadend streets a deadend streets shall not exceed 1200 feet in length as

second intersecting street upon future development of the adjoining parcel b deadend street systems shall not be constructed in a manner that would require a motor vehicle to travel more than 1200 feet from the intersection of origin to the most remote point of the street system unless a greater length is authorized by the commission because 24 of adverse topographical conditions difficult site configuration future road construction or other legitimate condition c if the commission finds that a proposed deadend street should be or is likely to be extended to adjoining property in the future the required turnaround circle shall be constructed with a street rightofway width stub extension and there shall be a notation on the plan stating that all segments of the turnaround outside of the normal road rightofway shall revert to the record owners of adjacent properties at such time as the turnaround is eliminated such notation shall also be entered on the deeds for the lots affected if a development includes land reverting back to abutting owners the surplus pavement shall be removed and the area regraded and seeded at the developers expense d deadend streets shall not be approved if there is sufficient land and suitable terrain to allow the street to have two connections with another existing or proposed street e no more than three 3 driveways shall have any access arc of the turnaround rightofway 5 street trees street trees shall be provided in accordance with of the regulations for public improvements unless the commission finds that the applicant has the ability and has proposed to preserve a roughly equivalent number and quality of trees within the street rightofway 6 private streets all new streets and extensions of existing streets in any proposed subdivision shall be required to meet the construction standards for public streets as set forth in these regulations all new streets or extensions of streets proposed in a plan of subdivision shall be deemed to be proposed as public streets unless the applicant requests in writing that the streets be approved as private streets the commission shall consider the plan of conservation and development and the potential need for public streets in determining whether to approve or deny requests for the approval of private streets g reserve strips privately owned reserve strips will not be permitted if such reserve strips would control access to land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use or for future development 25 h storm drainage 1 general design principles storm drainage collection systems shall be installed along the frontage of the lots or parcels to collect all street runoff to prevent flooding of roads and other properties to minimize the possibility of road icing and to prevent erosion and sedimentation off the site provisions must be made for the upgrading of any downstream ditch culvert or other drainage structures which introduction of additional drainage due to such subdivision would become undersized and create the potential for flooding 2 construction controls before construction commences soil and erosion and sediment control measures shall be installed and maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements in the regulations for public improvements including but not necessarily limited to the requirements of with any additional requirements that may be imposed by the connecticut department of energy and environmental protections thencurrent general permit for the discharge of stormwater from small municipal separate storm sewer systems 3 drainage construction standards see subsection 33a i sidewalks sidewalks shall be provided along all new streets or extensions of streets in a subdivision unless the commission waives the requirement by a threequarters vote of all of the members of the commission no such waiver may be granted unless the commission finds a that on existing streets that would be extended into the subdivision there are no
