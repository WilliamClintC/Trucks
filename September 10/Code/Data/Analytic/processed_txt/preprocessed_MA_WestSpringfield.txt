guidelines introduction the town of west springfield maintains all maps in a digital format within a geographic information system gis a considerable amount of staff time is devoted to keeping these maps up to date while maintaining the integrity of the map information although a majority of engineers currently use computerassisted design and drafting cadd software subdivision plans have traditionally been submitted in paper format a caddbased submission standard is being proposed in an effort to minimize the potential for degradation of map accuracy as well as minimizing the amount of effort that is necessary in order to convert subdivision plans into a gis format general guidelines the submission of subdivision plans in a cadd format is not mandatory if plans are not submitted in a cadd format the existing paperbased subdivision plan specifications must be adhered to & a processing fee will be charged this fee will be waived whenever a plan is submitted in the cadd format specified within these guidelines it is the discretion of the town planner to reject a caddbased plan if it is found that the format does not fall within these guidelines file format delivery medium and content file format cadd files must be delivered as ascii version of autocad drawing exchange files dxf this file format has become a defacto standard for exchanging cadd files between cadd software and it can be imported by most gis software the ascii version of dxf is a larger file size however if there are problems with the file it can be examined in a text editor perhaps making it possible to fix the problem it is acceptable for the dxf files to be compressed into the zip zip format which is a defacto standard for exchanging compressed data delivery medium and documentation files must be delivered on windows or msdos formatted 35 diskette or cdrom submissions will also be accepted in zip format as attachments sent to rwerbiskis@westspringfieldmaus the delivery medium or email message must be labeledtitled with project identifying information eg street name address municipal project number subdivision name etc and the format and version of the computer operating system on which the media was written accompanying documentation in a text txt file must include  name & release number of the cadd software on which the dxf file was created  format and version of the computer operating system on which the file was created  the same project identifying information as on the delivery media  a list of the file names on the delivery with a description of what is in each file certification that the delivery media is free of known computer viruses the name of the virus scanning software and the date of its most recent update and the date on which the virus scan was performed file content the following practices must be followed in creating the cadd file  cadd file model space must be the source of the dxf file  linear features must be continuous  linear features must not be broken by text  when creating features that will be represented as polygons in a gis cadd users must snap end points of lines together and must make sure polygon areas for the same feature type eg property boundaries do not overlap  features destined for use in a gis must be separated onto layers separate from features that will not be used in the gis in particular details insets and title block information should be isolated on their own layers  features must be organized into layers with one layer for each separate linear and point feature type in each of the following categories of map features water system sanitary sewer system storm drainage collection system topographic planimetric the cadd file used to produce the dxf file for import into west springfields gis should conform to the following practices and corresponding ones in microstation taken partly from aec caddd standard p 4  see references avoid using groups avoid multiline line types do not explode bocks representing point features before exporting to dxf do not using hatching objects splines ellipses do not use external drawing references do not use dimension objects do not use layer 0 for features destined for a gis database do not rotate the ucs user coordinate system do not change the origin do not use mtext multiline text  use dtext dimensional text do not use dimensions unless they are exploded into simple text dtext do not use hatches do not use leaders the line leading from a feature being labeled to the label file naming and symbolization each feature in the cadd dxf file submitted will be named and symbolized as described in the cadd standard map features table spatial reference the town of west springfield maintains a set of tax maps which are available free of charge online in the adobe acrobat format in addition to a regular set of tax maps a special set with property boundary reference numbers is also available each property boundary intersection in town has a unique reference number all plans submitted in accordance with the subdivision regulations whether paper or cadd format must include at least three of these points along with the reference number as text annotation if three of these points do not fall within the map area it is acceptable to place points with a tie distance & bearing reference to the location of a boundary point tax maps
