as needed and after the storm it should be noted that salt has a much slower effect on melting snow and ice at temperatures below 25 degrees and may not be applied until it is warmer all routes begin from the highway garage and operators will work systematically around their respective routes no operator will leave his or her assigned route unless heshe has the approval of the road agent or hisher appointed designee treatment of the roads may consist of sand sandsalt mix or straight sale the road agent or hisher designee will determine the most appropriate material to use based upon the current

at a period of time during the day when the majority of traffic has ceased this period will last no longer that four 4 hours and may last for a shorter time period if weather conditions change it will
