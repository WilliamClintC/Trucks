methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 10402c3a1 so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the control authority 1 will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial

lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 effect of an upset an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph 3 are met 3 conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset an industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the causes of the upset  b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  c the industrial user has submitted the following information to the potw and control authority within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five 5 days 1 a description of the indirect discharge and

the burden of proof 5 opportunity industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards 6 control industrial users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of

severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this section 3 notice a if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the control authority if possible at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass b an industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the control authority within twentyfour 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates

authority may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours 4 prohibition of bypass a bypass is prohibited and the control authority may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless 1 bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2 there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and 3 the industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph 3 of this section b the control authority may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects

occasionally the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size or shape or is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict application of the requirements contained in this chapter would result in substantial hardship or inequity the city council may vary or modify except as otherwise indicated such requirements of design but not of procedure or public improvements so that the subdivider may develop the subject property in a reasonable manner at the same time the public welfare and interests of the city must be protected and the general intent and spirit of this chapter are preserved by granting such variance such modification may be granted upon written request of the subdivider or the subdividers engineer stating the reason for each modification and may be approved by vote of the regular membership of the city council with the recommendation of the planning commission subject to the acceptance of the plat and the dedications thereon by the city council  provided however that a variation based on unique conditions shall not be granted when the unique conditions was created or contributed to by the subdivider b wqpz averaging the width of the wqpz may

the following 1 an overall average wqpz width of at least the base width as determined in subsection 19411b must be achieved within the boundaries of the property to be developed the wqpz on adjoining properties cannot be included with buffer averaging on a separate property even if owned by the same property owner 2 the average width must be calculated based upon the entire length of stream bank that is located within the boundaries of the property to be developed when calculating the wqpz length the natural stream channel should be followed 3 wqpz averaging shall be applied to each side of a stream independently if the property being developed encompasses both sides of a stream wqpz averaging can be applied to both sides of the stream but must be applied to both sides of the stream independently unless the natural topography of the stream makes one side of the stream not conducive to the establishment of a wqpz and in that event averaging using both sides may be utilized 4 wqpz averaging is prohibited in developments that have or will have after development areas that have slopes greater than fifteen 15 percent that are located within fifty 50 feet of the stream to be buffered 5 appeal from decision of public works director if the applicant desires to appeal from the decision of the public works director or his or her designee made in accordance with this

districts building permits may be obtained on all tracts of five 5 acres or greater that abut a public street that is open and which were filed of record on or before  prior to receiving a building permit to construct a new residential dwelling on such tracts the owner must deliver to the city a duly executed roadway and utility easement for all adjoining public or section line roads which abut the property in an amount sufficient to accommodate the proposed roadways as reflected on the adopted city of norman transportation plan dedication is not mandatory for building permits which do not constitute a change of use such as a residential addition or which involve agricultural uses for tracts containing more than forty 40 acres the roadway easement would only be required adjacent to that portion of the entire tract that approximates a forty 40 acre parcel such tracts shall comply with all other zoning requirements of the city of norman the purpose of all such dedications is to facilitate the eventual improvement of rural roadways any private improvements within the expanded roadway easement may remain until a roadway project occurs at which time the city would either pay for any existing improvements or institute condemnation action to acquire the real property as required by law all existing improvements must be noted on the dedication b deferral of public improvements 1 it is the purpose of this section to provide in specific cases as are hereinafter designated a procedure whereby the city council may temporarily defer the construction of certain

construction of the improvement would not immediately function for its intended use  or d where such improvement would be replaced by a planned future project 3 the city council after recommendation from the director of public works may accept a final plat and the program of improvements and defer public drainage improvements with the condition that the deferred drainage improvements are a part of the program of improvements but are the responsibility of the city of norman to construct under the following situations a where construction of required drainage improvements outside the boundary of a subdivision plat or other tract of land cannot be accomplished because the necessary easements or rightsofway cannot reasonably be obtained  or b where documentation is provided which demonstrates that reasonable and proper attempts have been made to obtain the necessary easements and rightsofway to construct the drainage improvements required by the city and that these attempts have been unsuccessful c deferral of such improvements shall not result in any increased flooding of any street or habitable structure 4 whenever it is deemed necessary by the city council to defer construction of any improvement other than drainage under section 19602b3 the applicant shall pay the cost as determined by the director of public works of future improvements to the city within ten

be separately accounted for and expended for no other purpose than in conjunction with the later construction of deferred improvement except for deferred drainage improvements 6 monies received by the city under authority of this section for drainage improvements must be separately accounted for but may be used for a drainage improvement other than the specific deferred improvement with the approval of the city council if the proposed drainage improvement addresses a problem of the tract of land that the specific deferred improvement serves the applicant is relieved of the obligation for the deferred improvement when its deferred funds are expended 7 if construction of the deferred facility has not commenced within ten 10 years from the date of deferment then the cost paid or the certificate of deposit may be returned upon action of the council upon written request of the payor 8 a deferment as contemplated by this section shall be submitted to the development committee for a recommendation of approval or disapproval at the same time the final plat is submitted the deferment and recommendation shall then be submitted to the city council for its consideration at the same time the final plat is submitted for acceptance c concurrent construction 1 it is the purpose of this section to provide under specific circumstances as are hereinafter designated a procedure whereby

hazard areas which are subject to periodic or occasional flooding during a one percent chance flood and for which special regulations are applied in addition to or in combination with other zoning regulations applying to these areas to guide the type and manner of floodplain use so that it is consistent with the land use needs of the city of norman it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 control in special flood hazard areas uses such as fill dumping storage of materials structures buildings and any other works which acting alone or in combination with other existing or future uses would cause damaging flood heights or erosive velocities by obstructing flows and reducing floodplain storage  8 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area  9 meet the needs of the streams to carry flood waters and protect the creek channels and floodplains from encroachment so that flood heights and flood damage will not be increased  10 enhance existing protections for residents structures and public facilities from flood damage  11 preserve floodplain areas for their open space and natural habitat values  and 12 establish provisions and procedures that will provide additional protections for floodplain areas with no net loss of allowable density on affected lots and parcels in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  87 1 fh 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  6 require the transfer of structures and buildings from portions of the lot in the floodplain to upland areas out of the floodplain  7 seek ways to reduce loss of natural floodplain areas and enhance natural and beneficial functions of floodplains in areas facing development to secure this protection from flooding the objectives of this section are to assure the retention of sufficient floodway area to convey flood flows  to designate a minimum flood protection elevation  to reduce the height and violence of floods insofar as such are increased by any artificial obstruction  and to assure the proper floodproofing of structures subject to flooding the purpose of the flood hazard district is to provide that designated special flood hazard areas are developed only in the interest of the communitys general health safety and welfare the flood hazard district is not for the purpose of encouraging development in areas of special flood hazard to further the interest of the communitys general health safety and welfare any violation of this section shall be deemed to constitute a public nuisance this ordinance is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this ordinance and another ordinance

xeriscape design principles when meeting the landscaping requirements of this section the term xeriscape is derived from a greek word meaning dry the desired effect is not the creation of a desert environment but the use of appropriate materials and methods to create a green environment with a lower demand for water the following principles guide this philosophy a planning and design consider the use of the landscape areas as well as the type of soil and exposure to the sun onsite detention is often required in new developments it should be incorporated into the overall landscape design b limited turn area ground cover must be installed to prevent soil erosion limit turf areas which have a high demand for water to locations that will be subject to heavy foot traffic consider the use of native grasses that are more drought tolerant such as buffalo grass 188 8 c efficient irrigation group plants with similar water needs so that the appropriate amount of water can be applied at the right time plan to irrigate turf areas separately from other plants trees and shrubs should be watered deeply to encourage good root development use different types of sprinkler heads for different purposes and consider drip irrigation for certain plant groups timers and watersensing devices that respond to rain and soil moisture are recommended for all new installations d soil improvement protect existing topsoil by stockpiling it during construction and control erosion using good construction practices test and analyze the soil and add organic matter to loosen soil gypsum should be added to heavy clay soils to lower its ph and loosen the soil e appropriate plant selection many varieties of drought tolerant plants are available that have a lower demand for water once established native species are better adapted to this climatic zone and should be used f mulch mulch should be used around all newly planted trees and shrubs as it saves moisture reduces weed growth and adds interest while reducing the need for turf mulch should be three 3 inches deep over soil that is covered with a breathable fabric avoid the use of solid plastic sheeting g maintenance turf areas should not be kept too short mowing height should be raised during hot summer months turf areas should be mowed using a mulching mower and clippings left on the lawn to decompose and add nutrients back into the soil trees should be pruned to enhance their appearance improve their health and allow good vision throughout the parking area 6 other requirements for landscaped areas a installation 1 all
