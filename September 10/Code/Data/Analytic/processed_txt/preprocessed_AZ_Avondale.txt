disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored cause damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss  5310 83  statement of purpose a it is

variance procedure 828  nature of variances a the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this article would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this article are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  5310 829  appeal board a the floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this article b the floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article c in passing upon such applications the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this article and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges d upon consideration of the factors of this section 829 and the purposes of this article the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance that are commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property  and 3 a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the maricopa county recorder and shall be recorded by the floodplain board in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to fema  5310 830  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation provided the procedures of divisions 2 and 3 of this article have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3 showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water this includes only facilities defined in section 85 of this article in the definition of functionally dependent use  and 4 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances  5310 831843  reserved stormwater quality protection  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article

materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of this to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment to the united states constitution or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material 1002 findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976 and barnes v

attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the city council finds a sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are typically uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism in the city to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises b certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments c sexual acts occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows d offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions e persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses f at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus city of avondale zoning sexually oriented businesses 293297512 232 infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections g since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states and in arizona h according to the arizona department of health services as of 1999 there have been 5786 reported cases of aids in the state of arizona i the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onethird of a million cases being reported in 1999 j the surgeon general of the united states in a report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn k according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts according to the surgeon generals call to action to promote sexual health and responsible sexual behavior dated  nearly twothirds of the 774467 aids cases reported since 1987 were sexually transmitted l sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities m numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films n the findings noted in paragraphs a above raise substantial governmental concerns o sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns p a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein q removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres city of avondale zoning sexually oriented businesses 293297512 233 r requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments s the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases t it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity u the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business operator or employee license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this v the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this classification sexually oriented businesses are classified as follows a adult arcades  b adult bookstores adult novelty stores or adult video stores  c adult cabarets  d adult hotels  e adult motion
