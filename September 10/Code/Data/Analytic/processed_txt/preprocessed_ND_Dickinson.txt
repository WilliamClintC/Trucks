provisions of this ordinance to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction 3 protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for intended purposes because of flood hazard 4 assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program when identified by the federal insurance administration as a flood prone community  floodway overlay districts findings of fact flood losses resulting from periodic inundation flood hazard areas of the city of dickinson north dakota are subject to inundation which results in loss of life or property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and  of 878 impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 1 general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities b the occupancy of flood areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages 2 methods used to analyze flood hazards this ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one 1% percent change of occurrence in anyone year as delineated by applicable flood insurance studies and the federal emergency management administrations flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway map or any subsequent effective flood insurance studies rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps issued after the effective date of this ordinance and adopted by the city of dickinson b calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood land to which this ordinance shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of dickinson identified on the flood insurance rate map firm as numbered and unnumbered a zone andor within the overlay districts fp and fw established in this ordinance in all areas covered by this ordinance no development shall be permitted except upon a permit to develop granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and
