commissioners then the site plan andor elevation plan review shall follow the same process as given in  b immediately above formerly  e  conditionalonly district and parallel traditional district zoning provisions a purpose this title identifies multiple residential nonresidential and mixed use zoning districts that may be assigned to parcels within the towns jurisdiction there are certain uses or site design layouts which because of their nature or scale have particular impacts on both the immediate area and the community as a whole development of these uses and situations may benefit the community but their unique aspects and needs cannot be predetermined within the confines of general district regulations in addition circumstances often arise when a general district designation would not be appropriate for a certain property but a specific use or group of uses permitted under the district would be consistent with the objectives of this title to accommodate these specific situations parallel traditional and conditional only districts conditional districts may be employed b parallel traditional districts the parallel traditional district process is established to address those situations when a particular use may be acceptable but the traditional classification which would allow that use would not be acceptable it allows the board of commissioners to approve a proposal for a specific use or group of uses with reasonable conditions to assure the compatibility of the uses with surrounding properties any use permitted under this process must also conform to the development regulations for the corresponding traditional zoning district this is a voluntary procedure which is intended for firm development proposals it is not intended or suited for securing early zoning for tentative proposals which may not be undertaken for some time unless a condition is included to have all development go subsequent site plan andor elevation plan review and approval by the board of commissioners 1 potential uses which may be considered for a parallel traditional district are restricted to those uses permitted in the corresponding traditional zoning district uses permitted in parallel traditional districts are subject to all applicable development standards and requirements for that use listed in the corresponding traditional zoning district 2 the application for a parallel traditional district must contain information andor site plans which will indicate all of the principal and accessory uses which are proposed to be developed on the town of matthews unified development ordinance   9 site subsequent to the approval of a parallel traditional district only those principal and accessory uses indicated on the approved plan may be constructed on the site any modifications to an approved plan or any changes in the permitted principal or accessory uses must comply with the provisions of   formerly   c conditionalonly districts the conditionalonly district process allows certain uses to be established in accordance with specific development standards for each use the categories listed at  b may be utilized only conditionalonly district process the standards for these districts are provided in d application and review process the following process applies to both the parallel traditional and conditionalonly districts for simplicity the term conditional district shall be used in this section to refer to both types of districts unless otherwise noted 1 application applications to establish a conditional district shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of     and   as appropriate as well as this section a conditional district classification shall be considered only if the application is made by the owner of the property or hisher authorized agent all applications must include a schematic plan drawn to scale and supporting text which will become part of the ordinance amendment the applicant should include at least the items listed below a a boundary survey showing the total acreage present zoning classifications date and north arrow b the owners names addresses and the tax parcel numbers of all adjoining properties c all existing easements reservations and rightsofway and all yards required for the zoning districts requested d proposed use of land and structures a site plan drawing to scale shall be submitted showing the outline of each building related parking and vehicular circulation pedestrian facilities storage service and loading facilities vehicular queuing plans where appropriate for the use storm water improvements recreational facilities required landscape screening and buffers and all other planned improvements to the site when this level of detail design has not yet been prepared the applicant may choose to submit a generalized site plan document showing overall proposed land use by location vehicular and nonvehicular circulation patterns preserved natural or historic features and required landscape screening and buffers this generalized site plan must include a written condition that all development on the site will go subsequent site plan andor elevation plan review and approval by the board of commissioners in addition general information on the intended density and intensity of development at buildout must be included on the site plan for residential uses this should include the number of units and an outline of the area where the structures will be located for nonresidential uses this should include the approximate square footage of all structures and an outline of the area where such structures will be located for applications for early designation to an applicable conditiononly district a lesser level of detail is necessary a site map showing land area in the requested zoning action is minimally required along with additional written andor graphic conditions matching the adopted small area plan or general development plan for the geographic area and conditions indicating any proposed refinement of design standards of the proposed conditionalonly district e traffic parking and circulation plans showing the proposed locations and arrangement of parking spaces and access points to adjacent streets all sidewalks bicycle facilities and multimodal pathways for nonmotorized transportation for early designation applications general motor vehicle and pedestrianbicycle circulation plans in written andor graphic format shall be submitted sufficient to show compliance with any small area plan or general development plan for the geographic area 2 additional requirementswhen dealing with the conditional district process it may be desirable to request additional information in order to evaluate a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area therefore the planning director planning board andor the board of commissioners may request additional information as they deem necessary this information may include but is not limited to the items listed below town of matthews unified development ordinance   10 a proposed screening including walls fences or planting areas as well as treatment of any existing natural features b delineation of areas within the regulatory floodplain as shown on official flood hazard boundarymaps formecklenburg county c existing and proposed topography at four foot 4 contour intervals or less d generalized information on the number height size or location of structures e proposed number and location of signs f approximate completion time of the project and proposed phasing if any 3 reviewand approval a in considering an application for the establishment of a conditional district the board of commissioners may attach reasonable and appropriate conditions to the location nature and extent of the proposed use any conditions should exhibit the relationship of the proposed use to surrounding property proposed support areas the timing of development and other matters that the board may find appropriate or the applicant may propose the applicant will have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to any such requirements prior to final action by the board of commissioners all conditions included in any conditional zoning approval require agreement of the property owner which may be accomplished by the owners authorized agent b in evaluating an application for the establishment of a conditional district it is appropriate for the commissioners to consider the following i the policies and objectives of the matthews land use plan and any relevant small area plan particularly in relation to the proposed site and surrounding area ii the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding area especially in regard but not limited to traffic storm drainage land values and compatibility of land use activities c in the review and approval of a parallel traditional district emphasis will be given to an evaluation of the characteristics of the specific uses proposed in relationship to surrounding properties 4 effect of approval if an application is approved the conditional district established and all conditions attached to the approval are binding on the property all subsequent development and use of the property must be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions the intent of this type of zoning is to provide an alternative procedure for specific development proposals it is intended that all property be zoned only in accordance with firm plans to develop therefore three years from approval the planning board will examine the progress made to develop in accordance with approved plans to determine if active efforts are proceeding if it is determined by the planning board that active efforts to comply with the approved plan are not proceeding a report will be forwarded to the board of commissioners which may recommend that action be initiated to remove the conditional district in accordance with the amendment procedures outlined in   and   5 zoningmap designation following board of commissioners approval of a conditional district the property in question will be identified on the zoning map by the appropriate parallel traditional or conditionalonly district designation formerly    use of flexible design standards a opportunity to apply certain conditional zoning districts are intended to allow flexibility in overall design use of flexible design provisions because it is not always possible to anticipate variations or improvements in the development types or to accommodate changes with broad allencompassing regulations which could create good quality of life opportunities these provisions allow the board of commissioners to consider and evaluate new and flexible design concepts in a specially designated and controlled setting town of matthews unified development ordinance   11 1 the rvs srn cmf mud ts and ent conditionalonly districts provide such a setting therefore the opportunity for flexible design standards may be included as an integral part of proposals for these districts 2 the cottage cluster housing alternative in the residential districts provide such a setting therefore the opportunity for flexible design standards may be included as an integral part of proposals for cottage cluster housing within any of the singlefamily zoning districts when requested parallel traditional district process 3 various permitted uses within the crc district may apply flexible design standards b purpose it is the objective of these flexible design standards to encourage development proposals that exhibit such special qualities or concepts that they may deviate from standard ordinance requirements these regulations are established in order that a flexible design proposal will be evaluated on its own merits it is recognized that some proposals or concepts will be more successful than others and the approval of a specific proposal in one situation does not mean that a similar proposal would be acceptable in other circumstances these provisions are purely optional and are a voluntary means by which land may be developed outside of the standard ordinance requirements these provisions are designed to evaluate only those flexible design concepts that propose to meet a community need that would not otherwise be met finally it should be emphasized that these provisions should not be confused with or take the place of the normal zoning and subdivision variance procedures established either in   or   c certain zoning development standards may be modified the quantitative dimensions and locational zoning standards listed here which would normally apply to development may be modified flexible design process 1

plan and any related adopted design guidelines and streetscape which together create a framework for preserving revitalizing and expanding on the social cultural and architectural heritage of the downtown area of the town of matthews the downtown master plan was developed after thorough study of the downtowns characteristics and its history the downtown overlay district is created to continue to focus on the concentrated central business area of matthews to protect its unique position in the community and to acknowledge the downtowns role in economic viability and general welfare of the town as a whole the historic downtown and its fringe areas are anticipated to develop and redevelop in the near future due to increased population and demand for more urban services nearby the downtown overlay district includes both the existing historic core and proposed extensions of the commercial hub in order to direct new expansion in a compatible development approach to the existing urban core this district stresses sensitivity to the pedestrian environment  urban design  urban open space  pedestrian scale signs street furniture and amenities  and urban landscaping in both the

board of commissioners are incorporated here by reference 1 creation of streetscape design standards the relationship between a building and areas for pedestrian or vehicular circulation must be carefully planned in order to avoid negative impacts of one upon the other the downtown master plan illustrates design standards for the public rightsof way for the majority of existing streets within the do district new streets shall be assigned a street type category as they are proposed in order to assure consistency in development of the public rightsofway all buildings and uses developed in

development guidelines the harmonious relationship between land uses and their environment requires that certain areas be addressed during project planning these relationships deal with the streetscape historic buildings and places and open spaces development or redevelopment subject to these provisions shall be built in accordance with the minimum urban design standards set forth in this purpose of this to define the minimum urban design standards for development in the do district in order to preserve the smalltown character while encouraging revitalization and expansion it is not the intent or expectation that new development should replicate a previous time period but the general design principles in place when the majority of the current historic core was developed are being recreated here for consistency in context for those buildings constructed between 1900 and 1940 the guiding general principles are as follows a buildings should address the street i entrances should face the street and be accessible from the sidewalk ii site layout should place the building generally at or near the front of the lot as indicated in the streetscape improvements with parking to the side andor rear of the building b buildings should be designed to be compatible with the context of the neighborhood i scale of new buildings should be in harmony with existing structures ii materials colors and styles should be compatible with existing structures c building styles should be traditional or styles adapted from local and regional interpretations of traditional architecture i building style should be appropriate to the intended use ii choice of building materials elements and details should be consistent with chosen architectural style elements that are obviously of another style should be avoided d overall design use of materials and ornamentation should be kept simple and in harmony with the scale of the building additional illustrative detail on how urban design standards may be satisfied is provided in the downtown master plan 3 structure design guidelines a buildto lines required buildto lines are established for most existing streets in the do

face in order to allow one 1 or two 2 driveways or loading areas for all the adjacent buildings c building design street walls and entrances must be designed to encourage and complement pedestrianscale activity building design should not be conceived in isolation as a singular entity but should consider the structures at either side and in the neighborhood in general it is intended

significantly enhance the ambiance of the public realm a civic buildings civic buildings contain public or civic uses of special significance to residents employees or visitors civic buildings are used for the following purposes community services day care education government places of worship or social services civic buildings must be designed to physically express their community prominence which means they should generally be sited adjoining or surrounded by civic spaces or where they provide a visual landmark by being placed at the axial termination of a street b civic outdoor spaces civic greens squares and plazas shall be designed planted and maintained according to the following requirements squares and plazas are generally intended to be active pedestrian centers and should be designed appropriate to their high foot traffic level with a higher percentage of paved surface area and should provide scattered shortinterval seating accommodations civic greens are spaces intended for less intensive foot traffic and visitors may stay for a longer duration use of pervious paving materials is encouraged to allow oxygen to reach tree roots 1 trees planted within civic spaces

at least forty 40 percent of the ground storys primary facade in transparent windows  buildings  general urban design principles  general these principles favor an aesthetic that is traditional in a broad sense and which create an architectural aesthetic of loadbearing walls and regionally appropriate materials the principles also specify certain details such as window proportions roof or parapet configurations shop fronts and overhang features the intent behind these urban design principles is to foster a unique image while utilizing regionally appropriate elements while materials techniques and product types are identified in this title as allowed use of equivalent or better practices and products are encouraged they shall be submitted to the town planning office either for administrative amendment as explained at   or flexible design as explained at   whichever applies many of the principles apply only in conditions where the building elements are clearly visible from the public use realm including streets shared parking areas and civic spaces these urban design principles therefore concentrate on the views from the public realm and minimize interference in the private realm for example an architectural element that is visible only opening in the street wall is not clearly visible from the public realm the following general principles are encouraged

building walls shall generally reflect and complement the traditional materials and construction techniques of the charlotte region on all sides of any structure which may be visible from the public realm they should express the construction techniques and structural constraints of traditional longlasting building materials simple configurations and solid craftsmanship are favored over complexity and ostentation in building form and the articulation of details all building materials to be used shall express their specific properties for example heavier more permanent materials masonry support lighter materials wood buildings constructed for commercial uses particularly retail which are predominately or wholly single story facilities need to pay particular attention to the impact of their

traffic impact analysis tia is a specialized study that evaluates the effects of a developments traffic on the surrounding transportation infrastructure it is an essential part of the development review process to assist developers and government agencies in making land use decisions involving subdivisions rezoning site plan reviews expansions of existing development and other development reviews the tia helps identify where the development may have a significant impact on safety traffic and transportation operations and provides a means for the developer and government agencies to mitigate these impacts ultimately the tia can be used to evaluate if the scale of development is appropriate for a particular site and what improvements may be necessary on and off the site to provide safe and efficient access and traffic flow a threshold for traffic impact analysis a traffic impact analysis tia is required for any proposed rezoning preliminary subdivision expansion of an existing

commission  session law 2004163   185 formerly known as   c findings it is hereby determined that development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reduce groundwater recharge  these changes in storm water runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and well planned controls to manage storm water runoff from development sites further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii storm water rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including the town of matthews the town to adopt the minimum storm water controls such as those included in the pco therefore the town establishes this set

carolina has in of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare formerly known as  15102 c findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of matthews and matthews land use jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life increased health and safety hazards destruction of property and disruption of commerce and governmental services inundation from flood waters results in public expenditures for flood protection flood disaster relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages formerly known as  15103 d purpose it is the purpose of the floodplain regulations to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and town of matthews unified development ordinance   2 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands formerly known as  15104 e objectives 1 the regulations of the special flood hazard areas herein set forth are intended to protect areas of designated floodplains subject to and necessary for regulating flood waters and to permit and encourage the retention of openland uses which will be so located and designed as to constitute a harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the town as provided in the comprehensive plans as such are adopted and amended from time to time 2 the specific intent in establishing special flood hazard areas composed of floodways and flood fringe areas includes the following a to control uses such as fill dumping storage of materials structures buildings and any other works which acting alone or in combination with other existing or future uses would cause damaging flood heights and velocities by obstructing flows and reducing floodplain storage  b to protect human life and health  c to minimize the expenditure of public money for costly floodcontrol projects  d to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  e to permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in flood hazard areas and to assure such permitted uses will not impede the flow of flood waters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at or above or below their locations along the floodways  f to minimize prolonged business interruptions  g to protect existing drainage courses that carry abnormal flows of stormwater in periods of heavy precipitations  h to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in floodplains  i to meet the needs of the streams to carry flood waters and protect the creek channels and floodplains from encroachment so that flood heights and flood damage will not be increased  j to inform existing and potential property owners that property is in a special flood hazard area as well as the associated flood risks and development restrictions  k to minimize future flood losses by depicting community flood fringe areas on the flood insurance rate maps  l to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas 3 this ordinance is intended to permit only that development within the floodplain which is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and presents a reasonable social and economic use of land in relation to the hazards involved the regulations hereinafter set forth shall apply to all property located within the special flood hazard area as shown on the flood insurance rate maps firm including fema andor locally approved revisions to data shown on the firms it is the intent that these regulations combine with
