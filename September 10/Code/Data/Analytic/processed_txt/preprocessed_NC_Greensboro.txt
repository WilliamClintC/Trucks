the ordinance to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship  city of greensboro north carolina land development v20170818  c the hardship is due to the

categories found in the use table in 3081 permitted use table are set forth in this section specific uses may be further defined in b any use not specifically listed in the use category in this section is prohibited unless the planning and community development director determines that the use is similar to a permitted use in that district where any similar permitted use is subject to additional use standards or special use permit approval the proposed use is also subject to those standards or approval 30832 basis for classifications use categories classify land uses and activities based on common functional product or physical characteristics characteristics include the type and amount of activity the type of customers or residents how goods or services are sold or delivered likely impact on surrounding properties and site conditions the use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning land uses to appropriate zoning districts 30833 uses not specifically listed when a specific use type cannot be readily classified into a use category or appears to fit into 2 or more use categories the planning and community development director is authorized to determine the most similar thus most appropriate use category based on the following considerations a the actual or projected characteristics of the activity in relationship to the stated characteristics of each use category  b the relative amount of site area or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity  c relative amounts of sales from each activity  d the customer type for each activity  e the relative number of employees in each activity  f hours of operation  g building and site arrangement  h types of vehicles used and their parking requirements  city of greensboro north carolina land

uses of a development fall within one use category the entire development is assigned to that use category  b when the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories each principal use must be classified in the applicable use category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that use category  and c a development comprised of uses regulated by separate rows on the use table must be reviewed using the most restrictive process from among the proposed uses commentary for example if a development includes a convenience store fuel sales and a restaurant and one of those uses is only permitted by special use permit in the district then the entire development requires a special use permit 30835 typical uses the typical use types portion of each use

the same time avoiding the negative environmental and urban design impacts that can result from an oversupply of parking spaces and other vehicular use areas 30112 applicability 301121 new development

flood damage prevention 301221 general a authority the legislature of the state of north carolina has in ncgs of   ncgs parts 3 5 and 8 of of ncgs of 160a delegated to local governmental units the responsibility to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare b purposes the flood damage prevention regulations adopted and prescribed in this section are found by the city council to be necessary and appropriate to city of greensboro north carolina land development v20170818  1 permit only that development within the floodplain which is appropriate in light of the probability of flood damage and which represents a reasonable social and economic use of land in relation to the hazards involved  and 2 minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by enactment of provisions designed to 3 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  4 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  5 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  6 control filling grading dredging and all other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  7 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  8 protect human life and health  9 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  10 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  11 minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  12 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water sewer gas electric cable and telephone lines trails boardwalks streets and bridges located in flood prone areas  13 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas  14 permit and encourage the retention of open land uses that will be so located and designed as to constitute a harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the community and that will not impede the flow of floodwaters  and 15 ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area or future conditions flood hazard area c reason for regulation of flood prone areas the flood prone areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation that could result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare d causes of flood losses flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of 1 obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 occupancy in flood prone

intent a general intent the watershed protection regulations adopted and prescribed in this ordinance to protect the public health are found by the city council to be necessary and appropriate to 1 protect stream buffers water supply watersheds and other watersheds from activities that could degrade water quality in the reservoirs and streams  2 reduce the volume of nutrients and other chemicals that could enter streams and the water supply by reducing the amount of runoff that any given development will generate  3 minimize land disturbance to reduce the amount of sediment washing into streams and lakes and to enhance the infiltration of runoff into soils thus alleviating the sedimentation of water supply lakes that reduces their storage capacity shortens their useful life and makes them less able to withstand drought  4 reduce the probability of the release of harmful chemicals into streams and water supply reservoirs either catastrophe or human error  5 provide for natural and engineered methods for managing the stormwater that flushes contaminants off of builtupon areas in the water supply watersheds and other watersheds that may reach water supply reservoirs and streams unless controlled 6 to require that new development maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in its postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  and city of greensboro north
