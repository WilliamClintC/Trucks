to promote safety and convenience conform to approved city standards and enhance curb appeal h an adequate street system to provide access to the project without unduly stressing the carrying capacity of that system i a plan that represents an overall development pattern that is consistent with the comprehensive plan the master street plan and other adopted planning policies the planning director may apply the above general design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific projects as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each project in some circumstances one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more critical in that particular case 145 designers and developers are urged to recognize that the guidelines regulations and recommendations detailed throughout this document are minimum standards and true excellence may lie beyond them no claim can be made that the following standards encompass every possible technique for achieving a high level of design quality the designer is encouraged to use his or her own creativity judgment and experience to improve upon these methods not simply to achieve individual objectives but also make a positive contribution to the city development standards in order to achieve the above listed general development review guidelines the following standards shall apply to all developments subject to development review a site characteristics and general requirements 1 the development should conform to the extent

discharges into the air shall not exceed the levels established by any state or federal environmental agencies 8 while construction of andor improvements to the site are in process noise levels at property boundaries should not exceed the given sites ambient levels except for reasonably short periods of time furthermore the city engineer may prescribe specific routes for the ingress and egress of dumptrucks haulers and other pieces of construction equipment which may otherwise create an adverse impact to the traffic flow along adjacent corridors b site coverage a maximum of 80% of the development site may be covered by impervious surface this number is derived by adding the total gross floor area gfa with the total lot coverage area lca as measured in square footage feet  then dividing that sum by the site area feet  the formula is detailed below gfa + lca  site area   percent impervious surface % a minimum of 20% of the total area of the site as measured in square footage feet  shall permanently remain a pervious surface the c1 central business district is exempt from this requirement 146 c standards and concepts for design and architecture during the development

these horizontal elements can be created use of color or paint differing textured masonry materials andor masonry coursing bonds contrasting colors andor paint changes shall be used except as outlined in the next sentence along with differing masonry surface treatments or textures differing raised masonry surfaces in higher value masonry such as brick stone or cast stone can be used to create horizontal banding when using lower value masonry such as split face block or precision block substantially contrasting colors shall be used even with raised surfaces or textures however color or paint variation alone is not sufficient in creating the desired horizontal features o16136 v in addition to the above horizontal elements architectural treatments may include but not be limited to

o16136 iv all buildings should shall have a defined base and cap o16136 b franchise architecture is strongly discouraged branding a structure makes it difficult if not impossible to redevelop into another use i sitespecific architectural design is desired rather than adapting a standard design floor plans and elevations that are unique to the community and are not a corporate or franchise design are encouraged by all developments o16136 ii the only franchise identifying feature should be minor faade details and the companys logo and signs iii please refer to paragraphs b c and d of the general design guidelines when making considerations c to avoid a monolithic appearance i design should attempt to break down buildings into smaller sections with each section varying in type material

enter into a jointaccess agreement whereupon they will share a single driveway which is ideally but not necessarily along their common property line iii parcels which cannot comply immediately due to undeveloped adjoining property or lack of a preexisting jointaccess agreement andor easement may be allowed a temporary curb cut at a location designated by the planning director this temporary curb cut shall be contingent on the property owner providing all of the following 1 a jointaccess easement depicted on the site plan with a width of no less than twelve 12 feet and no greater than forty 40 feet 2 a signed jointaccess agreement with the deed allowing a shared driveway or service drive along the desired adjoining property line 3 record of a joint maintenance agreement defining maintenance

management requirements established by any other federal state local regional or city access management systems or agency must be met 3 driveway throat length a driveway entrancesexits shall be designed to prevent a backup of vehicles waiting to egress onto the adjacent street the depth of the formal entrance way where vehicles may queue without interfering with traffic circulation is referred to as the throat length the length of this throat is particularly important for businesses that generate a high number of vehicle trips per day b throat length should be determined on a casebycase basis but generally varies according to the number of trips generated by the land use and the available area for constructing the driveway throat a traffic impact study based on peak hour demand is the best way to determine the extent of potential queuing problems and how best to resolve them c due to the dynamic nature of traffic patterns the planning director andor city engineer working in coordination with the project engineer shall make all driveway throat length determinations based upon the characteristics of each given site 4 right turn deceleration lanes a a dedicated right turn lane is often necessary when the right turn volume exceeds 750 vehicle trip ends per day andor the development fronts an arterial with a speed limit greater than fortyfive 45 mph b in most cases only moderate to largescale developments would warrant a right turn lane however certain circumstances may make the addition of a deceleration lane necessary even in situations where a development generates less than 750 vehicle trip ends daily c on lower volume driveways or in areas with limited rightofway tapers may be required to help remove turning vehicles from the roadway more quickly tapers may be most useful in rural areas where speeds are high and volumes low d the planning director andor city engineer working in coordination with the project engineer shall make this determination based upon the characteristics of a given site 5 parking a orientation i parking areas located in the front setback or between the principal structure and any public street including

when by the strict interpretation of these regulations a subdivider incurs undue restrictions on the physical property to be subdivided a variance for such requirements may be granted by the planning commission under no circumstance should a variance be granted because of a personal hardship or for personal or emotional reasons variances shall not be granted based strictly on financial hardship a variance is determined by the strict interpretation and enforcement of the rules and regulations upon a given piece of property to be subdivided 2 no variance shall be granted except upon written petition by the subdivider when the preliminary plat is filed under exceptional circumstances the planning commission may grant variances at the time of final plat approval the petition shall state fully the grounds for the variance and all the facts upon which the petition is made in granting the variance the commission shall prescribe any conditions that it deems necessary to or desirable in the public interest in considering the petition for a variance the commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land involved existing uses of land in the area proximity to public utilities the number of persons who will reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable effect of such variance upon traffic conditions and upon the public health safety and general welfare in the vicinity no variance shall be granted unless the commission finds all four of the following a that there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such that the strict application of the provision of this code would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of this land b that the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the applicant c that the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health safety and welfare or injurious to other property in the area d that the granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly subdivision of other land in the area in accord with the provision of this code 58 3 the findings of the commission together with the specific facts upon which findings are based shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the commission meetings at which such variance is granted variances may be granted only when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this code vacation of plats 1 any plat or any part of a plat may be vacated by the owner of the premises at any time before the sale of any lot therein by written instrument to which a copy of such plat shall be attached declaring the same to be vacated vacation of a plat shall be subject to the approval of the city council if the plat is located within the corporate limits and subject to the quorum court if located outside the corporate limits but within the planning jurisdiction of the conway planning commission 2 such an instrument shall be approved by the planning commission with the same plat submission requirements review processes and fees as are required for plats of subdivisions between the preliminary plat and the final plat the city council will be afforded the opportunity for review and may reject any such plat that destroys public rights in any of its public uses improvements streets or alleys 3 such an instrument shall be executed acknowledged or approved and recorded or filed in like manner as plats of subdivisions being duly recorded or filed shall operate to destroy the force and effect of the recording of the plat so vacated and to divest all public rights in the streets alleys and public grounds and all dedications laid out or described in such plat 4 when lots have been sold the plat may be vacated in a manner herein provided by all the owners of lots in such plat joining in the execution of such writings amendments on any proposed amendments to these regulations the planning commission shall hold a public hearing for which fifteen 15 days advance notice in a local newspaper of general circulation has been published following such hearing the city council may adopt the amendment or amendments as recommended by the planning commission or as determined by the majority vote of the city council provided the city council may waive the requirement for notice and public hearing contained herein upon a unanimous vote of the council #o0184 59 impact fees impact fees to pay for city infrastructure needs created by development are required to be paid specific to uses anticipated for the property and the procedures established by the city council these impact fees and the manner in which they are collected and utilized may be established by the city council and such fees may be adjusted by the city council at intervals as changing circumstances warrant a short title and applicability 1 this section may be known and cited as conways impact fee  and is referred to herein as this section 2 the provisions of this section shall apply to all of the territory within the corporate limits of the city of conway b intent 1 the intent of this section is to ensure that impactgenerating development bears a proportionate share of the cost of improvements to the citys major roadway and park systems  to ensure that the proportionate share does not exceed the cost of providing major roadways and parks  and to ensure that funds collected from impactgenerating development are actually used to construct major roadway or park system improvements that serve new development it is further the intent of this section to use road and park impact fees to implement the citys growth plan and master street plan 2 it is not the intent of this section to collect any money from any impactgenerating development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset demands generated by that development for major roadway or park system improvements for which the fee was paid c findings the city council of conway arkansas finds that 1 the protection of the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city requires that the roads and parks of the city be expanded and improved to meet the demands of new development 2 the creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the city to impose a more proportionate share of the costs of required improvements to the major roadway and park systems on those developments that create the need 60 3 the impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of development on the citys major roadway and park systems 4 the road and park impact fees described in this section are based on the impact fee study and do not exceed the capital costs required to serve the development that will pay the fees 5 the types of improvements to the major roadway and park systems considered in the impact fee study will benefit all impactgenerating development and it is therefore appropriate to treat the city as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the impact fees for each type of facility 6 there is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of new development covered by this section and the road and park impact fees that such development will be required to pay 7 this section creates a system by which impact fees paid by impactgenerating development will be used to expand the major roadway and park systems so that the development that pays each fee will receive a corresponding benefit within a reasonable period of time after the fee is paid 8 the impact fees are calculated in the impact fee study based on the existing level of service for road and park facilities for roads the level of service is defined as the systemwide ratio of capacity to demand in the major road system and the fees are based on a onetoone ratio even though the existing system provides significantly more capacity than existing demand for parks the level of service is based on the ratio of the replacement value of existing parkland and improvements to the existing number of equivalent dwelling units d definitions for the purpose of interpreting this section certain words used herein are defined as follows applicant the applicant for a building permit for which an impact fee is due pursuant to the provisions of this section equivalent dwelling units edus represents the impact of a typical singlefamily dwelling on the park system a typical singlefamily unit represents on average one edu other types of units each represent a fraction of an edu based on their relative average household sizes growth plan the comprehensive development plan for the city which

for which a building permit is requested is not specified on the above schedule the impact fee administrator shall determine the fee on the basis of the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule in the case of road impact fees the impact fee administrator shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type of land use by trip generation rates contained in the most current edition of the report titled trip generation prepared by the institute of transportation engineers ite or articles or reports appearing in the ite journal 3 in many instances a particular structure may include auxiliary uses associated with the primary land use for example in addition to the actual production of goods manufacturing facilities usually also have office warehouse research and other associated functions the impact fees generally are assessed based on the primary land use if the applicant can document that a secondary land use accounts for over 25% of the gross floor area of the structure and that the secondary use is not assumed in the trip generation or other impact data for the primary use then the impact fees may be assessed based on the disaggregated square footage of the primary and secondary land use even when located within shopping centers fastfood restaurants and service stations convenience stores with gasoline sales shall be considered primary uses 4 if the type of impactgenerating development for which a building permit is requested is for a change of land use type or for the expansion redevelopment or modification of an existing development the fee shall be based on the net increase in the fee for the new land use type as compared to the previous land use type 5 in the event that the proposed change of land use type redevelopment or modification results in a net decrease in the fee for the new use or development as compared to the previous use or development there shall be no refund of impact fees previously paid h independent fee calculation 1 the impact fee may be computed by the use of an independent fee calculation study at the election of the applicant or upon the request of the impact fee administrator for any proposed land development activity interpreted as not one of those types listed on the fee schedule or as one that is not comparable to any land use on the fee schedule and for any proposed land development activity for which the impact fee administrator concludes the nature timing or location of the proposed development makes it likely to generate impacts costing substantially more to mitigate than the amount of the fee that would be generated by the use of the fee schedule 2 the preparation of the independent fee calculation study shall be the sole responsibility and cost of the party electing to utilize the study 68 3 any person who requests to perform an independent fee calculation study shall pay an application fee for administrative costs associated with the review and decision on such study 4 the independent fee calculation study shall be based on the same formulas level of service standards and unit costs for facilities used in the impact fee study and shall
