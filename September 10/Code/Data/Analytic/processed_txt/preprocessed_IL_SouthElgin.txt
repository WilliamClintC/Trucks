apply to all land uses in a fen groundwater recharge zone which generate impervious surfaces greater than 25% of the total land area of any development 1stormwater storage athe runoff from the roadways and roadside ditches shall be collected and conveyed to facilities designed for the storage of stormwater in accordance with applicable village ordinances the facilities shall be designed so that they are lined so that infiltration into the groundwater zone is inhibited and the discharge from these ponds shall be conveyed to suitable discharge points directly to the stream system or to municipally maintained stormwater conveyance facilities or to privately maintained stormwater conveyance facilities as approved by the village bthese stormwater storage facilities shall be vegetated in a manner to promote chemical and biological activity using the best methods known and available at the time of development to remove typical urban pollutants such as chlorides and common plant nutrients copen spaces that are vegetated such as parkland shall be maintained in a manner that promotes the infiltration of runoff to the maximum extent practical these measures can include preparation of the soils by deep plowing and discing and the planting of deeprooted native vegetation appropriate for the purposes outlined 2stormwater conveyance ato the maximum extent practicable stormwater discharges from roadways roadside ditches and hydraulically connected paved surfaces shall be conveyed separately from the stormwater runoff from open space and vegetated lawns conveyance of stormwater runoff from the open space vegetated lawns and other unpaved surfaces shall be accomplished by means generally described as best management practices and shall include vegetative swales and open channel flow in order to promote infiltration of stormwater from these areas into the groundwater recharge zones bthe conveyance of the separated stormwater runoff from roadways roadside ditches and hydraulically connected paved surfaces shall be designed to contain flows up to as a minimum the tenyear flood flow rate flows which exceed the tenyear flood flow rate follow overland flow paths that are combined with the stormwater runoff from other vegetated areas of the site 3development criteria autility construction and excavations will be done in such a way so as to least alter the movement of groundwater towards a fen as determined by the village engineer mass grading of the site shall be minimized and only in accordance with the geotechnical investigation to define the effect of the mass grading on the movement of groundwater bareas within the boundaries of recharge zones which have been substantially altered prior to the effective date of this chapter so that they no longer function or inadequately function to recharge groundwater to a fen shall also be subject to the technical requirements of this chapter when approved for development including but not limited

permitted by the village passed 12400  15505 establishment or amendment of groundwater recharge district athe applicant shall be responsible for establishing whether or not the subject property is

is within a fen groundwater recharge zone 1existing stratigraphic maps may be used to determine the likelihood of a property being within a recharge zone 2where maps or site geotechnical studies show that the geologic conditions are suitable for groundwater recharge a detailed hydrogeologic study shall be performed which will include a minimum of two groundwater monitoring wells or a number of wells sufficient to establish the direction of groundwater flow with biweekly monitoring for a one year period unless a shorter period is approved which will capture seasonal variation in groundwater the purpose of monitoring is to establish the direction of groundwater movement should it be determined that groundwater movement is in the direction of the fen then the subject property shall be included in the groundwater recharge zone if these studies show that the movement of groundwater is not in the direction of the fen the property shall not be included in the recharge protection zone the village engineer shall review and approve all studies for this purpose and shall make all final determinations as to groundwater recharge zone boundaries ba fen groundwater recharge zone may be amended from timetotime to exclude those areas which do not naturally function to recharge groundwater based on further scientific study and research and further monitoring of groundwater and surface water discharges amendment may occur only if the applicant can show with scientific study and groundwater monitoring that areas included within the fen groundwater recharge zone are not effective in promoting the groundwater hydrology of the fen studies for this purpose shall be reviewed and approved by the village engineer passed 12400  15506 required studies and development criteria any applicant for a development which will generate impervious surfaces greater than 25% in a fen groundwater recharge zone shall be required to perform detailed geotechnical and hydrogeological investigations of the site and shall submit the results of this study with his application for development these geotechnical studies shall further define the location and depth of the upper and lower groundwater aquifers occurring within the development site these studies shall analyze the effects of excavation within the development on movement of groundwater towards a fen the studies shall also
