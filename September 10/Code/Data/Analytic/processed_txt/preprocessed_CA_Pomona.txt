accomplished only at substantial cost and inconvenience with the concurrent ability to find another location and in many instances the removal requires a separation of the mobile home unit from appurtenances which have been made permanent thus creating severe damage and depreciation in value to the mobile home 2 pursuant to studies and hearings conducted by the city council and city staff

increased nonpoint source pollutant loading to the receiving waterbodies and the beaches 3 stormwater runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants 4 increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development and have impacted the water resources of the san gabriel river watershed and the
