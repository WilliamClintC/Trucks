standards and principles site development stormwater plans standards and principles for site development stormwater plans are set forth in article vi of this chapter   i 3272007 steep slopes a purpose the purpose of this section is to regulate the intensity of use in areas of steeply sloping terrain in order to limit soil loss erosion excessive stormwater runoff the degradation of surface water and to maintain the natural topography and drainage patterns of land b background disturbance of steep slopes results in accelerated erosion processes from stormwater runoff and the subsequent sedimentation of waterbodies with the associated degradation of water quality and loss of aquatic life support related effects include soil loss changes in natural topography and drainage patterns increased flooding potential further fragmentation of forest and habitat areas and compromised aesthetic values it has become widely recognized that disturbance of steep slopes should be restricted or prevented based on the impact disturbance that steep slopes can have on water quality and quantity and the environmental integrity of landscapes c applicability this section shall be applicable to new development or land disturbance on a steep slope within the township of south brunswick d definitions as used in this section the following meaning of the indicated words shall prevail disturbance means the placement of impervious surface the exposure or movement of soil or bedrock or the clearing cutting or removing of vegetation impervious surface means any structure surface or improvement that reduces or prevents absorption of stormwater into land and includes porous paving paver blocks gravel crushed stone decks patios elevated structures and similar structures surfaces or improvements however gravel and crushed stone incorporated into a recharge basin trench or similar stormwater practice as infiltration material shall not be considered impervious redevelopment means the construction of structures or improvements on areas which previously contained structures or other improvements steep slopes means any slope equal to or greater than 20 percent as measured over any minimum run of ten feet steep slopes are determined based on contour intervals of two feet or less e designations of areas the percent of slope rise in feet per horizontal distance shall be established by measurement of distance perpendicular to the contour of the slope the percent of slope shall be calculated for each twofoot contour interval for example any location on the site where there is a onefoot rise over a tenfoot horizontal run constitutes a ten percent slope  a one and onehalffoot rise over a tenfoot horizontal run constitutes a 15 percent slope  a twofoot rise over a tenfoot horizontal run constitutes a 20 percent slope f steep slope limits for steep slopes any disturbance shall be prohibited except as provided below 1 redevelopment within the limits of existing impervious surfaces  and 2 new disturbance necessary to protect public health safety or welfare such as necessary linear development with no feasible alternative  to provide an environmental benefit such as remediation of a contaminated site  to prevent extraordinary hardship on the property owner peculiar to the property  or to prevent extraordinary hardship provided the hardship was not created by the property owner that would not permit a minimum economically viable use of the property based upon reasonable investment the applicant shall demonstrate plans depicting proposed development and topography that new disturbance is not located in areas with a 20 percent or greater slope g conflicts 1 all other ordinances parts of ordinances sections of this other local requirements that are

if a proposed development requests a variance or exemption from strict compliance with the groundwater recharge stormwater quantity and stormwater quality requirements outlined in section 622574 the applicant must implement a mitigation project that shall be subject to approval of the township engineer development review board and governing body b selection of an appropriate mitigation project for a requested variance or exemption must adhere to the following requirements 1 the project must be within the same area that would contribute to the receptor impacted by the project note that depending on the specific performance standard waived the sensitive receptor andor the contributory area to that receptor may be different if there are no specific sensitive receptors that would be impacted as the result of the grant of the waiverexemption then the location of the mitigation project can be located anywhere within the township and should be selected to provide the most benefit relative to an existing stormwater problem in the same category quality quantity or recharge 2 legal authorization must be obtained to construct the project at the location selected this includes the maintenance and any access needs for the project in the future 3 the project should be close to the location of the original project and if possible be located upstream at a similar distance from the identified sensitive receptor this distance should not be based on actual location but on a similar hydraulic distance to the sensitive receptor for example if the project for which a waiver is obtained discharges to a tributary but the closest location discharges to the main branch it may be more beneficial to identify a location discharging to the same tributary 4 for ease of administration if sensitive receptors are addressed it is preferable to have one location that addresses any and all of the performance standards waived rather than one location for each performance standard 5 it must be demonstrated that implementation of the mitigation project will result in no adverse impacts to other properties 6 mitigation projects that address stormwater runoff quantity can provide storage for proposed increases in runoff volume as opposed to a direct peak flow reduction c the following information shall be required for each request for a variance or exemption from the aforementioned performance standards 1 impact from noncompliance provide a table quantifying what would be required for the project to achieve the standards the extent to which this value will be achieved on site and the extent to which the value must be mitigated off site 2 narrative and supporting information regarding the need for the waiver including a the waiver cannot be due to a condition created by the applicant if the applicant can comply with the design and performance standards outlined in section 622574 reduction in the scope of the project the applicant has created the condition and a waiver cannot be issued demonstrate that the need for a waiver is not created by the applicant b provide a discussion and supporting documentation of the site conditions peculiar to the subject property that prevent the construction of a stormwater management facility that would achieve full compliance with the design and performance standards site conditions may include soil type the presence of karst geology acid soils a high groundwater table unique conditions that would create an unsafe design as well as conditions that may provide a detrimental impact to public health welfare and safety c demonstration that the grant of the requested waiverexemption would not result in an adverse impact that would not be compensated for by off site mitigation 3 sensitive receptor identify the sensitive receptors related to the performance standard from which a waiver is sought demonstrate that the mitigation site contributes to the same sensitive receptor 4 design of the mitigation project provide the design details of the mitigation project this includes but is not limited to drawings calculations and other information needed to evaluate the mitigation project 5 responsible party list the party or parties responsible for the construction and the maintenance of the mitigation project documentation must be provided to demonstrate that the responsible party is aware of has authority to and accepts the responsibility for construction and maintenance under no circumstance shall the responsible party be an individual single family homeowner selection of a project location that is under township authority avoids the need to obtain authority from a third party for the construction and future maintenance of the project 6 maintenance include a maintenance plan that addresses the maintenance criteria at njac 58 in addition if the maintenance responsibility is being transferred to the township or another entity the entity responsible for the cost of the maintenance must be identified the township may provide the option for the applicant to convey the mitigation project to the township if the applicant provides for the cost of maintenance in perpetuity 7 permits any and all necessary local state or other applicable permits for the mitigation measure or project must be obtained prior to the township approval of the project for which mitigation is being provided 8 construction demonstrate that the construction of the mitigation project coincides with the construction of the proposed project a certificate of occupancy or final approval by the township for the project requiring mitigation cannot be issued until the mitigation project or measure receives final approval i 3272007 penalties except as otherwise provided by law
