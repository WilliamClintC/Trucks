a the flood hazard areas of city of plaquemine are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art 1  b 10813 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public

protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the

vendors business to become financially stable enough to secure a permanent location outside of the depot at the appropriate time it is our intent to offer depot market customers a fun place to shop with a diverse selection of merchandise for sale depot market reserves the right to refuse any merchandise which in our estimation will hinder the overall scope of the depot market and its booth
