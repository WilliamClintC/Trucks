121900 no disturb zone presumption a lands within 200 feet of rivers streams creeks and brooks and lands within 100 feet of all other resource areas are presumed important to the protection of these resources because activities undertaken in close proximity to resource areas are presumed to result in alteration of the resource area and to have adverse impact upon the wetland values protected by this chapter either immediately as a consequence of construction or over time as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities these adverse impacts from construction and use can include without limitation erosion siltation loss or impairment of groundwater recharge or flood control poor water quality and loss of wildlife habitat the commission therefore may require that the applicant maintain a strip or buffer of continuous undisturbed vegetative cover within 200 feet of resource areas defined in section 322 definitions resource area 9 and within 100 feet of resource areas defined in section 322 definitions resource area 18 respectively unless the applicant convinces the commission by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the area or part of it may be

alternative to the project with less adverse effects and that 2 such activities including proposed mitigation measures will have no significant adverse impact on the wetland values protected by this chapter the closer an activity is proposed to a resource area the more scrutiny will be given to the potential impacts of a proposed project c no activity which will result in the alteration of land within the presumptive no disturb zone shall be permitted by the conservation commission with the following exceptions 1 planting of native vegetation or habitat management techniques designed to enhance the wetland values protected by the bylaw  2 construction and maintenance of unpaved pedestrian access paths not more than four feet in width  3 maintenance of existing structures utilities

conservation commission standards  6 construction of new utility lines where the proposed route is the best environmental alternative  7 septic system maintenance and if a system has failed repairreplacement meeting statelocal standards where the maximum feasible buffer is maintained  8 construction of accessory structuresuses associated with lawfully existing singlefamily houses where the conservation commission finds that alternatives outside the buffer area are not available  the size and impacts of the proposed structureuse have been minimized  and the structureuse is located as far from the resource as possible  9 where a buffer zone is already altered such that the required buffer cannot be provided without removal of structures andor pavement this requirement may be modified by the conservation commission provided that it finds that the proposed alteration will not increase adverse impacts on that specific portion of the buffer area or associated wetland and that there is no technically demonstrated feasible construction alternative  10 where a lot is located entirely within buffer area the commission may permit activities within the buffer area when the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed work has been designed to minimize impacts to the buffer area as mitigation the commission may require the applicant to plant or maintain a naturally vegetated buffer of the maximum feasible width given the size topography and configuration of the lot  121900 storm water and drainage requirements all work subject to review under this chapter shall

will have no significant adverse impact on the areas or wetland values protected by this chapter b the commission shall regard as practicable an alternative which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed property use overall project purpose eg residential institutional commercial or industrial purpose logistics existing technology costs of the alternatives and overall project costs  121900 general wetland loss and replacement a pursuant to this chapter the conservation commission shall not permit wetland alteration except in the following circumstances 1 water dependent uses and structures  2 construction of new utilities and operation and maintenance of existing utility lines  3 public projects b if the conservation commission finds

been provided to foster the values and interests protected by this chapter the commission may permit limited wetland alteration  121900  square foot wetland loss at its sole discretion the commission may issue an order of conditions allowing work which results in the loss of a portion of freshwater wetlands when 1 said portion has a surface area of less than 500 square feet  and 2 said portion

district underlying the cluster development if there is undeveloped intervening common land or public open space between said yard and the abutting property this area may be included in the required dimensional setback for the subject cluster however in no case can the sum of the lot setback and the width of the buffer be less than that required for the district underlying the cluster or thirtyfive 35 feet whichever is more e every individual lot in the cluster development shall have an area of at least twothirds of the minimum area per dwelling unit required in the district or six thousand six hundred 6600 square feet whichever is larger the balance if any remaining in common land the special permit granting authority shall have the right to further waive minimum lot area
