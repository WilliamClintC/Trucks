smaller than those of more recently developed singlefamily homes all provisions of this chapter are intended to protect r1 zones from the intrusion of uses and activities incompatible with the character of singlefamily areas it is also the intent that these zones have adequate light and space around the buildings and be well landscaped with mature trees and shrubbery so that they will be continuing assets to the borough and will promote a stable healthy and safe environment r2 medium density residential the provisions for the r2 zones are similar to those for r1 except that in r2
