wastewater customer into a public sanitary sewer of substances which may endanger the public health and safety  or of unpolluted waters which do not require treatment and therefore reduce the effectiveness of the biological operations of a treatment facility bit is further understood that the biological and chemical operations which can be designed for wastewater treatment do by their scientific nature limit the types of constituents in wastewater which may be treated by facilities constructed and maintained within a reasonable cost to the public consequently the treatment facilities are designed for the primary purpose of treating domestic wastewater in sufficient manner to protect public health certain industrial wastewater constituents can be treated without interference at the wastewater facilities but only in a limited quantity or concentration to ensure that discharges of industrial wastewater into the public sanitary sewer are within such quantity and

stormwater management   title this subchapter shall be officially known as the stormwater management  it is referred to herein as this subchapter passed 52407   authority the town is authorized to adopt this subchapter pursuant to north carolina law including but not limited to of the constitution of north carolina  gs  1432147 and rules promulgated by the environmental management commission thereunder  session law 2006246   185 and passed 52407   findings ait is hereby determined that 1development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  2these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and 3these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites bfurther the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this subchapter ctherefore the town establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge passed 52407   purpose ageneral the purpose of this subchapter is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment and illicit discharges into municipal stormwater systems it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  and protect water and aquatic resources bspecific this subchapter seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1 establishing decisionmaking processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources  2requiring that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm to reduce flooding stream bank erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3establishing minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4establishing design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural stormwater bmps that may be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5encouraging the use of better management and site design practices such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of greenspace riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6establishing provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater bmps to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety  7establishing administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans for the inspection of approved projects and to assure appropriate longterm maintenance  8controlling illicit discharges into the municipal separate stormwater system  9controlling erosion and sedimentation from construction activities  and 10assigning responsibility and processes for approving the creation and maintenance of adequate
