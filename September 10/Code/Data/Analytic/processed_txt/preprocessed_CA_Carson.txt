healthy tree measure the width and depth of the root ball prior to digging the diameter of the planting hole shall be dug at least two 2 times wider than that of the root ball the depth of the planting hole shall be dug slightly shallower than the depth of the root ball to allow for the top one 1 inch of the root crown to remain above the finished grade c before placing the tree into the planting hole tamp down the base of the hole to allow the tree to stand straight and to avoid the potential of the tree settling below the finished grade scarify or scrape the sides of the planting hole to break down any glazing or compaction that may have occurred as a result of digging d position the tree in the hole so that the tree stands upright and the top of the root crown is slightly exposed above the grade backfill the planting hole with clean native soil no higher than halfway up the root ball slightly tamp the soil to remove air pockets but be sure not to compact the soil too much complete the backfilling to the finished grade once again tamp the soil slightly to remove air pockets e form a watering basin out of backfill material approximately six 6 inches high around the drip line of the tree remove all nursery stakes ties and ribbons from the tree and install the planting and staking materials as specified give the tree an initial deep watering fill watering basin as many times as necessary to completely saturate root ball f tree stakes and ties should be removed from the tree within two 2 years after planting or when the circumference of the trees trunk is equal to or exceeds the circumference of the stakes    3910 young tree maintenance schedule all newly planted trees shall be placed on a schedule to receive young tree maintenance immediately after a

prohibited unless a permit is obtained all city trees shall be pruned on a regular basis using professionally accepted standards as established by the international society of arboriculture isa best management practice and ansi pruning standards whichever is more protective of tree preservation all city trees shall be pruned in a manner that will encourage good development while preserving their health structure and natural appearance shearing topping heading back stubbing lion tailing or pollarding of public trees is prohibited except in accordance with isa standards a thinning sometimes called dropcrotching in mature trees shall be the standard pruning technique for city trees a thinning cut is the removal of a branch at its point of origin or the shortening of a branch to a lateral that is large enough to assume the terminal role b when removing a live branch pruning cuts should be made just outside the branch bark ridge and collar this location of cut is in contrast to a flush cut which is made inside the branch bark ridge and collar flush cuts should be avoided because they result in a larger wound and expose trunk tissues to the possibility of decay if no collar is visible the angle of the cut should approximate the angle formed by the branch bark ridge and trunk c when removing a dead branch the final cut should be made just outside the branch bark ridge and collar of live callus or wound wood tissue if the collar has grown out along the branch stub only the dead stub should be removed  the live collar should remain intact d if it is necessary to reduce the length of a branch the final cut should be made just beyond without violating the branch bark ridge of the branch being cut to the remaining branch should be no less than onethird 13 the diameter of the branch being removed and with enough foliage to assume the terminal role e pruning cuts should be clean and smooth leaving the bark at the edge of the cut firmly attached to the wood a three 3 cut process sometimes referred to as jumpcutting should be used to remove larger limbs in order to avoid stripping or tearing of the bark and to minimize wounding    3912 training young trees properly trained trees will develop into structurally strong trees well suited for their surrounding environment these trees should require little corrective pruning as they mature young trees that reach a large mature size should have a sturdy tapered trunk with wellspaced branches that are smaller in diameter than the trunk each city tree shall be scheduled for training at least once within the first three 3 years after being planted as part of a young tree maintenance program the young tree maintenance program shall entail evaluating the overall condition of the tree cleaning out of any dead wood and pruning the tree in such a manner as to develop good structure checking to ensure stakes and ties are providing adequate support for the tree and examining the watering basin to verify that the tree is receiving adequate water    3913 pruning mature trees as trees mature their need for structural pruning should decrease pruning should then focus on maintaining tree structure form health and appearance this shall be accomplished 1 of the three 3 methods described below a crown cleaning or cleaning out is the removal of dead dying broken diseased crossing weakly attached and lowvigor branches from a trees crown as well as the elimination of water sprouts sucker growth and foreign materials from the entire tree b crown restoration is intended to improve the structure and appearance of trees that have sprouted vigorously after being broken topped or severely pruned using heading cuts one 1 to three 3 sprouts on main branch stubs should be selected to form a naturalappearing crown the more vigorous sprouts may need to be thinned or cut to a lateral to control length growth or ensure adequate attachment for the size of the sprout crown restoration may require several prunings over a number of years crown restoration shall be completed as is necessary based upon the specific conditions and circumstances surrounding the tree c crown thinning is the selective removal of branches to increase light penetration and air movement crown thinning opens the foliage of the tree reduces weight on heavy limbs distributes ensuing invigoration throughout the tree and helps retain the trees natural form when thinning the crown of mature trees no more than twentyfive 25 percent of the trees live growth should be removed in slower growing or particularly sensitive species such as native oaks no more than ten 10 percent of live growth should be removed trees shall always be thinned to their natural form and should retain wellspaced inner lateral branches with foliage trees and branches so pruned will have mechanical stress more evenly distributed along the branch and throughout the tree    3914 pruning cycles frequency of pruning is also important to a trees health the city of carson is divided into twentyone 21 trimming zones for purposes of scheduling tree trimming in the citys public rightofway exhibit f at the end of this  the citys objective is to service seven 7 zones annually within a three 3 year trim cycle scheduling is at the discretion of the public works division every tree in each zone shall be pruned when that particular zone is being serviced if a resident requests tree pruning before or after their zone is serviced it shall be at the discretion of the public works division to schedule hazardous conditions shall be evaluated and attended to as soon as possible    3915 street and sidewalk clearance street and sidewalk clearance standards shall be achieved raising crown raising is the removal of lower branches in order to provide clearance for vehicles pedestrians and bicyclists only those branches that must be removed to achieve the established height clearance standards shall be pruned all such pruning cuts shall be thinned back to the nearest lateral found above the set minimum height standard where possible young or developing trees should be maintained in such a manner that at least onehalf 12 of the foliage should be on branches that originate in the lower twothirds 23 of the tree similarly branches should have even distribution of foliage along their lengths this will ensure a wellformed tapered structure and will uniformly distribute stress within the tree all city trees shall be maintained to the height clearance specifications established below a over sidewalks or park paths limbs shall be raised to a minimum of seven 7 feet and a maximum of eight 8 feet from grade to first lateral branch in locations where no sidewalks exist limbs may be retained below this minimum elevation as long as they conform to the natural shape of the species in locations where city street trees are set back from or do not interfere with sidewalk traffic limbs may also be retained below this minimum height specification b over residential or collector streets limbs shall be raised gradually from eight 8 feet at curb to thirteen 13 feet over traffic lanes from the grade to wood giving the appearance of an arch rather than an angle c over arterial streets limbs shall be raised to fourteen 14 feet from grade to first lateral branch a major arterial street may require a higher maximum over central traffic lanes for existing mature canopyforming limbs d visibility clearance for streetlights or signage shall be achieved windowing foliage of a tree rather than severely raising or reducing its crown only those branches that need to be removed to attain the visibility clearance desired shall be pruned all such pruning cuts shall be thinned back to the nearest lateral found away from the structure that is to be cleared    3916 utility clearance lineclearance tree workers must be trained safely around highvoltage conductors the united states occupational safety and health act osha and the american national standards institute ansi have established minimum distances to be maintained by tree workers from electrical conductors all lineclearance work involving city trees shall adhere to these standards as well as the utility pruning standards established by the isa and the utility arborists association uaa    3917 clearance guidelines the following guidelines are designed to maintain the required clearance of city trees from highvoltage power lines with a minimum of resprouting and fewer pruning cycles and the cost of the maintenance a a trees growth under utility lines is most economically managed by lateral or directional pruning thinning cuts directional pruning is the removal of a branch to the trunk or a significant lateral branch growing away from the conductor heading cuts topping on the other hand encourage vigorous sprouting and increase the frequency of pruning cycles and the cost of maintenance b all trees in the public rightofway should be examined for hazards before commencing with lineclearance work hangers and dead wood should be removed where possible the tree should be allowed to attain normal height with crown development maturing away from highvoltage conductors to achieve clearance pruning should be restricted to removal of branches at crotches within the trees crown c as few pruning cuts as are reasonable should be used to achieve the required clearance d when the pruning of a branch will result in the loss of more than onehalf 12 of the foliage on the branch it should be removed to the parent stem e precautions shall be taken to precut large limbs to avoid stripping or tearing the bark and minimize unnecessary wounding heavy limbs should be lowered on ropes to avoid damaging bark on limbs and trunks below f the placement of pruning cuts shall be determined by anatomy structure and branching habit limbs should not be arbitrarily cut off based on a preestablished clearing limit g final dropcrotch cuts should be made outside the branch bark ridge on the main stem or lateral branch the remaining branch shall be no smaller than onethird 13 the diameter of the portion being removed the removed portion should be pruned out to direct the remaining growth away from conductors    3918 exceptions to proper pruning techniques the edison co is currently administering line clearance in the city of carson every effort has been made to work in cooperation with the edison co the city has shown concern and requested that proper pruning techniques are adhered to by the edison co whenever possible an example of a situation where proper pruning techniques would not be followed would be with a tree that has grown above the utility lines and must be topped to achieve clearance with a situation such as this every effort must first be made to dropcrotch or directionally prune the tree as few branches as possible will be topped when this situation occurs removal and replacement of the tree is at the discretion of the public works division palm trees in particular shall be evaluated on an individual basis because palms are killed when topped every effort shall be made to remove and replace the tree and when possible obtain compensation for sale of the tree    3919 root pruning the root system of a tree is one of its most important physiological components roots are the main source of water and mineral absorption for the tree they provide a foundation and stability and they act as one of the principal storage areas for food the proper pruning of a trees roots when necessary is as important as the proper pruning of a trees crown    3920 root removal  avoidance whenever possible the city utility companies or contractors shall avoid removing any of a trees root system in instances where there exists a need to install subsurface structures or utilities such as irrigation lines or block wall footings every effort shall be made to avoid encroachment within the drip line of a tree if it becomes necessary to excavate within a trees drip line every effort if costefficient shall be made to tunnel under or throughout the trees root system with a minimal amount of pruning rather than to trench across the trees roots    3921 root removal  methods when root removal becomes necessary for the installation andor repair of hardscape such as sidewalks driveway approaches or curb and gutters and other utilities two 2 methods shall be employed by the city to eradicate invasive or encroaching roots these two 2 methods are specified below a selective root pruning is the removal of specific offending roots which are directly interfering with a work area when pruning out selective roots great care shall be given to retain as much root surface as possible including sufficient buttress root dispersal around the radius of the tree roots shall be cut back at least four 4 inches away from new hardscape to the nearest node pruning cuts shall be made clean and smooth with minimal crushing or tearing of the remaining root b root shaving is the removal of a small portion of a nonessential buttress root or general root with a diameter of four 4 inches or greater roots will be shaved to allow for at least two 2 inches of clearance between the root and the new hardscape shaving cuts shall be made clean and smooth with no crushing or tearing of the remaining root  root shaving shall be undertaken at the discretion of the public works division c where root pruning is needed within eight 8 feet of the trunk of the tree removal of the tree shall be considered as an option if structural integrity of the tree will be compromised    3922 certified arborist any citycontracted tree company shall be required to have in their employment a fulltime permanent certified arborist as accredited by the international society of arboriculture isa this person shall be responsible for ensuring that the contractors crews are performing work according to the city specifications    3923 contractor qualifications any person firm or corporation engaged in the business of trimming or removing any parkway tree shall carry commercial general liability and property damage auto and workers compensation insurance at a minimum limit of $1000000 each the insurance certificates must be on file with the risk management department and the city clerk    3924 removal the public works division will trim or remove any publicly owned tree or plant including any part thereof regardless of the location if it is determined by the manager or hisher designee that removal or trimming is necessary to eliminate any hazard or risk to public safety or property the following are conditions permitting removal a where the tree foliage or any limb or the shrub or plant is interfering with a primary structure and there is no feasible alternative to mitigate the interference  b where a written determination has been made after a visual inspection and evaluation that the tree is so diseased or damaged that it is no longer viable or it is a threat to property or to other trees  c where the tree is so poorly formed due to stunted growth that its preservation would not result in any substantial benefit to the community  d where the tree interferes with utility services or any street or highway and no reasonable alternative exists other than removal or trimming of the tree  e where the tree is a potential safety hazard due to the risk of it falling and its structural instability cannot be remedied  or where any other risk to persons or property is presented  f where the tree is causing damage to improvements including but not limited to any building foundation retaining wall roadwaydriveway sidewalkcurb patio andor deck or is interfering with the use and enjoyment of property  g where the tree is host to an organism which is parasitic to another species of tree thereby endangered by the parasite  or h where the tree belongs to a species which is known to be pyrophytic or highly flammable andor has been identified as a public safety hazard    3925 removal when  appeal a city tree shall be removed only if it meets one 1 of the abovestated conditions if a resident does not agree with staffs decision on a removal request they may appeal to the manager the public works division will provide interested residents with information on the city appeal process the city manager and city council will serve as the appeal body for the development services general managers decisions    3926 inspection the manager or his or her designee may inspect any parkway tree or plant or any tree or plant standing on any private property which overhangs or projects over or into any street park alley or public place of the city to determine whether it or any part of it is in such condition as to constitute a safety hazard or impediment to the progress or vision of anyone traveling in the street park alley or public place however nothing herein shall authorize the manager to enter private property without the consent of the owner or lawful possessor of the property unless otherwise permitted by law    3927 developmentconstruction all parkway trees planted in a new subdivision shall be in accordance with the parkway tree guidelines and shall be paid for by the subdivider unless otherwise provided by the city council the city council may require any subdivider to pay all costs of proper parkway tree planting along the streets of any new subdivision before approving any subdivision map    3928 protective measures for trees during construction the manager or hisher designee shall determine during the project review process whether and to what extent conditions or measures will be required to protect parkway trees during construction this decision shall be based upon the proximity of the construction activity to parkway trees the conditions and protective measures include but are not limited to the following a the parkway trees shall be enclosed by chain link fencing with a minimum height of five 5 feet or by another protective barrier approved by the manager prior to the issuance of grading or building permit and prior to commencement of work b barriers shall be placed at least five 5 feet outside the drip line of parkway trees the manager if appropriate to the species and the adjacent construction activity may approve a lesser distance c there shall be no grade changes within the protective barriers without prior approval any roots greater than two 2 inches in diameter which are damaged or exposed shall be cleanly saw cut and covered with soil in conformance with isa standards d excavation or landscape preparation within the protective barriers shall be limited to the use of hand tools and small handheld power tools and shall not be used at a depth that could cause root damage to the parkway tree e no attachments or wires other than those of a protective or nondamaging nature shall be attached to a parkway tree f no equipment or debris of any kind shall be placed within the protective barriers no fuel paint solvent oil thinner asphalt cement grout or any other construction chemical shall be stored or allowed in any manner to enter within the protective barrier g if access within the protective barrier around a parkway tree is required during the construction process the route shall be covered with a six 6 inch mulch bed in the drip line area and the area shall be aerated and fertilized at the conclusion of the construction h when the existing grade around a parkway tree is to be raised drain tiles shall be laid over the soil to drain liquids away from the trunk as determined by the manager or his or her designee the number of drains shall depend upon the soil material lighter sandy soil and porous gravelly material require fewer drains than heavy nonporous soils like clay dry wells shall be large enough to allow for maximum growth of the tree trunk dry well walls shall be constructed of materials that permit passage of air and water i when the existing grade around a parkway tree is to be lowered either by terracing or by a retaining wall a combination may be used to lower grades as determined by the manager or his or her designee with either method the area within the drip line shall be left at the original grade the retaining wall shall be porous to allow for aeration j parkway trees that have been destroyed or have received major damage during construction shall be replaced prior to final inspection and subject to the managers direction and approval as to size variety and species    3929 hardscape in keeping with the citys policies for protecting and preserving the health and wellbeing of our urban forest while providing for the safety of our citizens the following guidelines have been established for correcting potentially hazardous situations that result from tree roots disturbing nearby hardscape    3930 hardscape damage there are several factors that must be considered in determining the course of action necessary for addressing hardscape damage concerns that involve city trees these actions are driven by the extent of the damages and whether the damages are located on private property the public works division shall inspect all hardscape damage if the hardscape concerns include potential damage to private property the matter shall be referred to the manager for evaluation upon initial inspection of the area staff must determine what course of action is necessary to respond to the problem the following are the most commonly occurring hardscape problems and the courses of action that shall be employed to rectify them a hardscape damage is within the public rightofway and will require a temporary asphalt ramp followed by permanent repair of the area at a later date generally an asphalt ramp should be installed if there exists a deviation in the concrete that is greater than threefourths 34 of an inch b hardscape damage is within the public rightofway but is of such a minor nature that the damaged area can be ground down by a concrete grinding machine any deviation in the concrete of less than onehalf 12 of an inch should be able to be rectified by grinding the raised lip down to grade if necessary permanent repair of the area should be scheduled for a later date c hardscape damage is within the public rightofway but the nature of the damages cannot be rectified by temporary measures thus permanent repair of the area will need to be scheduled based upon the potential damages for creating a public safety hazard d hardscape damages are on private property and thereby cannot be addressed by the city however there are clearcut indications that at least some of the damages that have occurred are a direct result of a tree in the public rightofway thus the resident may have reason to file a claim for damages with the city if the resident does elect to file a claim the manager or his or her designee shall be responsible for evaluating the damaged area and submitting a tree assessment report to the city clerk for inclusion with the claim file e hardscape damages are on private property and thereby cannot be addressed by the city and there exists no clearcut indication that a city tree is the source of damages thus the resident will be responsible for excavation of the damaged area for the purpose of exposing any invasive roots should they wish to file a claim for damages with the city f hardscape damage is on private property and is clearly caused by a cityowned street tree in the public rightofway g upon excavation of the area it is the residents responsibility to contact the public works division and schedule an evaluation and assessment of the damage the managers designee shall be responsible for submitting this assessment report to the city clerk for inclusion with the residents claim h once a course of action has been determined staff shall be responsible for providing written notification to the involved parties informing them of staffs findings and of what measures they or the city will need to take to rectify the problem    3931 repairing or replacing hardscape the general policy that shall be observed when repairing or replacing hardscape adjacent to a public rightofway tree is that the health and integrity of the tree shall be taken into consideration before work commences every effort shall be made to protect the tree from root or trunk damage    3932 new hardscape installation several alternatives are available for accommodating the installation of new hardscape without severely infringing upon a trees root system the public works division shall first evaluate any hardscape installation that may involve the removal of an extensive portion of a trees root system if it is determined by the public works division that the removal of the offending roots might jeopardize public safety or the health or integrity of the tree then one 1 of the following alternatives should be considered a offset an offset is the tapering or reduction of a sidewalks size down to a width no less than fortyeight 48 inches b ramping a sidewalk may be constructed to ramp over offending roots as long as the slope of the grade does not exceed one 1 foot of elevation change within a span of twelve 12 linear feet c reconfiguration sidewalks do not need to be constructed in a straight line if the public easement can accommodate it a sidewalk may be reconfigured to curve around a tree in a suitable manner d removal if no other hardscape installation alternative is feasible a tree may be removed as long as it complies with the tree removal criteria established in this    3933 interference with work no person shall interfere or cause any person to interfere with the manager or persons acting under his or her authority while engaged in planting mulching pruning spraying treating trimming or removing any parkway tree shrub or plant or in the removal of any stone cement or other substance or plant material from or adjacent to the trunk of any parkway tree no person shall injure or destroy any parkway tree by any means including but not limited to the following a constructing concrete asphalt brick or gravel sidewalk raised planter or otherwise filling up the ground area around any tree so as to substantially shut off air light or water from its roots or detrimentally restrict root growth  b piling building equipment materials or any other substance around any tree so as to cause injury  c pouring spraying or depositing any deleterious substance around any tree or on the surrounding ground lawn or sidewalk  d posting of any sign poster notice or other object on any tree tree stake or guard  e causing any wire charged with electricity to come in contact with any tree  or f causing any fire or burning near or around any tree    3934 penalties it shall be unlawful for any person firm

providing for its own open space landscaping recreational facilities offstreet parking and amenities for contemporary living any deviations from the requirements of the zoning not significantly reduce or alter the design of the project to the extent that overall qualities of the architecture and site plan are compromised architectural unity and harmony should be achieved both within the project and between the project and the surrounding community so that the project does not constitute a disruption to the established fabric of the community the height of proposed structures should be compatible with the existing and anticipated development within the area to the extent feasible structures should be designed to reduce height adjacent to existing buildings of smaller scale and the public rightofway consideration should be given to innovative design which effectively provides for residential projects of higher density while assuring adequate fire protection water supply vehicular and pedestrian circulation and other public services in designing projects which are intended for affordable residential development consideration may be given to a reduction in lot area configuration and street frontage for singlefamily residential lots the design of the subdivision should be compatible with existing singlefamily developments within the immediate neighborhoods lot sizes should not be less than four thousand 4000 square feet in area and should provide sufficient widths and street frontages to allow for adherence to minimum front side and rear yard setback requirements the

cmc 912811 apply to residential stock cooperatives  912811 intent and purpose residential condominium projects may require that numbers of householders with vested ownership in their respective dwelling units live in close proximity to one another condominium projects also require that such owners be bound together in an association which is responsible for the maintenance management and possible reconstruction of improvements within the common area of the project this mix of individual and common ownership is different from conventional and familiar patterns of housing in the city the unique status of residential condominium projects tends to magnify the effects associated with higher urban densities to the point where they may lead to conditions of mismanagement neglect and blight that impact upon the public health safety welfare and economic prosperity of the larger community to ensure that such problems are avoided in both the short and long term it is the express intent of the city to treat residential condominiums differently from apartments and other like structures pursuant to such intent and in order to provide guidance in the consideration of proposed condominium projects the purposes of cmc 912811 are as follows to ensure that the significance of the fragmented pattern of condominium ownership with respect to longrange planning unforeseen change and maintenance of the citys housing stock is not superficially discounted in favor of shortterm and expedient financial considerations to establish reasonable procedures for the dissolution of the condominium and demolition of the structures at the end of their economic functional or physical life and thus obviate conditions of residential obsolescence and blight and their pernicious effects upon both immediate occupants and the larger community to ensure that the potentially deleterious effects resulting from a lack of continuous and centralized management do not impact upon the public health safety and welfare and at the same time ensure that there is democratic and effective management of the project that does not allow over time a majority of the unit owners to effectively contravene the initial commitments made to the project at the time of its inception and thus undercut the good faith of any minority of unit owners to ensure that the project developer provides adequate private outdoor living space storage space and parking space to meet the expectations and changing needs of property owners over a long period of time to ensure that the project developer is attentive to the performance characteristics of the structure and mitigates such problems as vibration and noise transmission which may not be apparent to the buyer without living in the unit but which if not adequately attenuated may nevertheless render the living environment within the project undesirable and the transfer of unit ownership difficult to ensure that the project developer uses contemporary and environmentally sensitive concepts of site planning and architectural design in the creation of the project and to ensure that the project once completed maintains its integrity over time not only to preserve the longterm financial commitment of the unit owner but also to optimize the utilitarian and aesthetic qualities that make the project a viable home for him in the future to ensure that when appropriate governmental entities have the right to enter into specified areas of the project to protect the public health safety and welfare and preserve the public peace  912812

existing residential condominium or its common areas within the city unless and until a conditional use permit is obtained therefor the commission may grant a conditional use permit if it finds that compliance with the provisions of cmc 912814 would impose a cost or other hardship disproportionate to the proposed structural or architectural alteration  provided that the applicant is making reasonable efforts to conform to those provisions and the purposes delineated in cmc 912811 912813 application for conditional use permit the application for a conditional use permit for a proposed residential condominium project shall include the following information in the number of copies and degree of detail which the director determines to be sufficient for the commission to evaluate the

development standards and development criteria delineated in cmc 912815 and 912816 a condominium proposal which does not comply with all of the precise development standards in these sections may be approved where the commission finds that there are unusual circumstances regarding the developments location site or configuration  that the project is in substantial compliance with both the development standards and development criteria and that there are mitigating features incorporated in the project which tend to further the expressed intent and purpose of cmc 912811 recognizing that the conversion of existing multiple residential structures to condominium usage presents unique problems with respect to the requirements of this the commission is empowered to vary any and all requirements contained herein in regard to a particular conversion proposal upon a finding that the creation of the proposed condominium will not have the potential to contravene the intent and purpose of cmc 912811 project characteristics of critical importance in determining whether a proposed conversion has that potential include the age of the structure and the degree to which the proposal varies from the required standards for the following parking unit size sound transmission characteristics private open space storage space the commission also is empowered to impose conditions on its approval of the conditional use permit which would require that specified modifications designed to bring a structure more nearly into compliance with the condominium development

criteria shall apply to proposals for multiplefamily development usage made pursuant to the provisions of cmc 912851 shall serve as a basis for the evaluation of accepted and appropriate planning and architectural techniques necessary for the orderly development of the city and concurrently shall give substance to the policies necessary to achieve the purposes of these sections the project should be a comprehensive and integrated design providing for its own open space offstreet parking and amenities for contemporary living insofar as the scale of the project allows open space walkways and other areas for people should be separated from parking areas driveways and other areas for automobiles architectural unit and harmony should be achieved both within the project and between the project and the surrounding community so that the project does not constitute a disruption to the established fabric of the community the layout of structures and other facilities should effect a conservation in street driveway curb cut utility and other public or quasipublic improvements structures should be designed to minimize within the context of accepted architectural practice the consumption of natural resources either directly or indirectly eg gas water electricity the project should be designed to maintain as much of the natural topography large trees and environment as practical the configuration and orientation of the project should respect reasonable design limits imposed by the natural and manmade environment structures should be situated to take advantage of view topography sun and wind while at the same time not destroying these advantages for adjacent properties structures should also be situated to minimize or buffer any undesirable characteristics of the site such as street noise and nearby obnoxious commercial or industrial uses the layout of units and open space within the project should establish use of structure and landscape materials a perceptible spatial transition from the public street semiprivacy of the common areas to the privacy of the unit most importantly the environment of each unit should be private and free from visual

multiplefamily residential projects  912811 intent and purpose residential condominium projects may require that numbers of householders with vested ownership in their respective dwelling units live in close proximity to one another condominium projects also require that such owners be bound together in an association which is responsible for the maintenance management and possible reconstruction of improvements within the common area of the project this mix of individual and common ownership is different from conventional and familiar patterns of housing in the city the unique status of residential condominium projects tends to magnify the effects associated with higher urban densities to the point where they may lead to conditions of mismanagement neglect and blight that impact upon the public health safety welfare and economic prosperity of the larger community to ensure that such problems are avoided in both the short and long term it is the express intent of the city to treat residential condominiums differently from apartments and other like structures pursuant to such intent and in order to provide guidance in the consideration of proposed condominium projects the purposes of cmc 912811 are as follows to ensure that the significance of the fragmented pattern of condominium ownership with respect to longrange planning unforeseen change and maintenance of the citys housing stock is not superficially discounted in favor of shortterm and expedient financial considerations to establish reasonable procedures for the dissolution of the condominium and demolition of the structures at the end of their economic functional or physical life and thus obviate conditions of residential obsolescence and blight and their pernicious effects upon both immediate occupants and the larger community to ensure that the potentially deleterious effects resulting from a lack of continuous and centralized management do not impact upon the public health safety and welfare and at the same time ensure that there is democratic and effective management of the project that does not allow over time a majority of the unit owners to effectively contravene the initial commitments made to the project at the time of its inception and thus undercut the good faith of any minority of unit owners to ensure that the project developer provides adequate private outdoor living space storage space and parking space to meet the expectations and changing needs of property owners over a long period of time to ensure that the project developer is attentive to the performance characteristics of the structure and mitigates such problems as vibration and noise transmission which may not be apparent to the buyer without living in the unit but which if not adequately attenuated may nevertheless render the living environment within the project undesirable and the transfer of unit ownership difficult to ensure that the project developer uses contemporary and environmentally sensitive concepts of site planning and architectural design in the creation of the project and to ensure that the project once completed maintains its integrity over time not only to preserve the longterm financial commitment of the unit owner but also to optimize the utilitarian and aesthetic qualities that make the project a viable home for him in the future to ensure that when appropriate governmental entities have the right to enter into specified areas of the project to protect the public health safety and welfare and preserve the public peace  912812 existing residential condominiums existing residential condominiums which do not comply with the provisions of cmc 912811 shall be nonconforming uses and shall be allowed to continue operation subject to the following provisions except for strictly interior modifications to individual condominium units no structural or architectural alterations except incidental maintenance shall be made to any existing residential condominium or its common areas within the city unless and until a conditional use permit is obtained therefor the commission may grant a conditional use permit if it finds that compliance with the provisions of cmc 912814 would impose a cost or other hardship disproportionate to the proposed structural or architectural alteration  provided that the applicant is making reasonable efforts to conform to those provisions and the purposes delineated in cmc 912811 912813 application for conditional use permit the application for a conditional use permit for a proposed residential condominium project shall include the following information in the number of copies and degree of detail which the director determines to be sufficient for the commission to evaluate the project a

type of construction the proposed condominium documents including the declaration of covenants conditions and restrictions description of project elements and tentative condominium plan that would apply to the conveyance of units the assignment of parking and the management of common areas within the project such other information which the commission or director determines is necessary to evaluate the proposed project 912814 development policy the commission shall review all proposals for residential condominium usage in order to determine their degree of compliance with both the development standards and development criteria delineated in cmc 912815 and 912816 a condominium proposal which does not comply with all of the precise development standards in these sections may be approved where the commission finds that there are unusual circumstances regarding the developments location site or configuration  that the project is in substantial compliance with both the development standards and development criteria and that there are mitigating features incorporated in the project which tend to further the expressed intent and purpose of cmc 912811 recognizing that the conversion of existing multiple residential structures to condominium usage presents unique problems with respect to the requirements of this the commission is empowered to vary any and all requirements contained herein in regard to a particular conversion proposal upon a finding that the creation of the proposed condominium will not have the potential to contravene the intent and purpose of cmc 912811 project characteristics of critical importance in determining whether a proposed conversion has that potential include the age of the structure and the degree to which the proposal varies from the required standards for the following parking unit size sound transmission characteristics private open space storage space the commission also is empowered to impose conditions on its approval of the conditional use permit which would require that specified modifications designed to bring a structure more nearly into compliance with the condominium development standards contained herein be made to the structure proposed for conversion 912815 development standards the commission shall require except as noted above that all residential condominium projects conform to all ordinances of the city and all of the following condominium development standards private open space notwithstanding the minimum total amount of usable open space required for a project

intent and purpose of this    length of and separation between buildings each detached residential building within a condominium project shall have a linear horizontal distance no greater than six 6 units in length the spacing between main residential buildings within condominium projects shall be at least ten 10 feet except where a parking space is proposed therein in which case there shall be

architectural techniques necessary for the orderly development of the city and concurrently shall give substance to the policies necessary to achieve the purposes of these sections the project should be a comprehensive and integrated design providing for its own open space offstreet parking and amenities for contemporary living insofar as the scale of the project allows open space walkways and other areas for people should be separated from parking areas driveways and other areas for automobiles architectural unit and harmony should be achieved both within the project and between the project and the surrounding community so that the project does not constitute a disruption to the established fabric of the community the layout of structures and other facilities should effect a conservation in street driveway curb cut utility and other public or quasipublic improvements structures should be designed to minimize within the context of accepted architectural practice the consumption of natural resources either directly or indirectly eg gas water electricity the project should be designed to maintain as much of the natural topography large trees and environment as practical the configuration and orientation of the project should respect reasonable design limits imposed by the natural and manmade environment structures should be situated to take advantage of view topography sun and wind while at the same time not destroying these advantages for adjacent properties structures should also be situated to minimize or buffer any undesirable characteristics of the site such as street noise and nearby obnoxious commercial or industrial uses the layout of units and open space within the project should establish use of structure and landscape materials a

purpose of this condominium projects may require that numbers of householders with vested ownership in their respective dwelling units live in close proximity to one another condominium projects also require that such owners be bound together in an association which is responsible for the maintenance management and possible reconstruction of improvements within the common area of the project this mix of individual and common ownership is different from conventional and familiar patterns of housing in the city the unique status of residential condominium projects tends to magnify the effects associated with higher urban densities to the point where they may lead to conditions of mismanagement neglect and blight that impact upon the public health safety welfare and economic prosperity of the larger community to ensure that such problems are avoided in both the short and long term it is the express intent of the city to treat residential condominiums differently from apartments and other like structures pursuant to such intent and in order to provide guidance in the consideration of proposed condominium projects the purposes of this as follows a to ensure that the significance of the fragmented pattern of condominium ownership with respect to longrange planning unforeseen change and maintenance of the citys housing stock is not superficially discounted in favor of shortterm and expedient financial considerations  b to establish reasonable procedures for the dissolution of the condominium and demolition of the structures at the end of their economic functional or physical life and thus obviate conditions of residential obsoleteness and blight and their pernicious effects upon both immediate occupants and the larger community  c to ensure that the potentially deleterious effects resulting from a lack of continuous and centralized management do not impact upon the public health safety and welfare and at the same time ensure that there is democratic and effective management of the project that does not allow over time a majority of the unit owners to effectively contravene the initial commitments made to the project at the time of its inception and thus undercut the good faith of any minority of unit owners  d to ensure that the project developer provides adequate private outdoor living space storage space and parking space to meet the expectations and changing needs of property owners over a long period of time  e to ensure that the project developer is attentive to the performance characteristics of the structure and mitigates such problems as vibration and noise transmission which may not be apparent to the buyer without living in the unit but which if not adequately attenuated may nevertheless render the living environment within the project undesirable and the transfer of unit ownership difficult  f to ensure that the project developer uses contemporary and environmentally sensitive concepts of site planning and architectural design in the creation of the project and to ensure that the project once completed maintains its integrity over time not only to preserve the longterm financial commitment of the unit owner but to optimize the utilitarian and aesthetic qualities that make the project a viable home for him in the future  g to ensure that when appropriate governmental entities have the right to enter into specified areas of the project to protect the public health safety and welfare and preserve the public peace  9302 zoning and conditional use permits required a no residential condominium shall be permitted in any zone unless such zone permits such usage and unless and until a conditional use permit is obtained therefor b existing residential condominiums which do not

areas within the city unless and until a conditional use permit is obtained therefor an applicant seeking a conditional use permit in order to make structural or architectural alterations to an existing condominium shall not arbitrarily or unreasonably be denied a conditional use permit where compliance with the provisions of cmc 930 930 9306 and 9307 would impose a cost or other hardship disproportionate to the proposed structural or architectural alteration  provided that the applicant is making reasonable efforts to conform to those provisions and the purposes delineated in cmc 9301

of parking and the management of common areas within the project  f such other information which the planning commission or planning department determines is necessary to evaluate the proposed project  9304 condominium development policy a the planning commission shall review all proposals for condominium usage in order to determine their degree of compliance with both the condominium development standards and development criteria delineated in cmc 9305 and 9306 below a condominium proposal which does not comply with all of the precise development standards in this be approved where the commission finds that there are unusual circumstances regarding the developments location site or configuration that the project is in substantial compliance with both the development standards and development criteria and that there are mitigating features incorporated in the project which tend to further the expressed intent and purposes of this recognizing that the conversion of existing multiple residential structures to condominium usage presents unique problems with respect to the requirements of this the planning commission is empowered to vary any and all requirements contained herein with regard to a particular conversion proposal upon a finding that the creation of the proposed condominium will not have the potential to contravene the intent and purpose of this characteristics of critical importance in determining whether or not a proposed conversion has that potential include the age of the structure and the degree to which the proposal varies from the required standards for the following parking unit size sound transmission characteristics private open space storage space c the planning commission is also empowered to impose conditions on its approval of the conditional use permit which would require that specified modifications designed to bring a structure more nearly into compliance with the condominium development standards contained herein be made to the structure proposed for conversion  9305 condominium development standards to achieve the purpose of this planning commission shall require except as noted above that all condominium projects conform to all ordinances of the city and all of the following condominium development standards a private open space notwithstanding the minimum total amount of usable open space

ii such space may be provided within individual storage lockers cabinets or closets in any location approved by the planning commission but shall not be split among two 2 or more locations moreover since it is the intention of this standard to require space over and above that normally associated with the daytoday functioning of the unit the planning commission shall exercise reasonable discretion in differentiating between such required private storage space and guest linen or clothes closets or food pantries that are customarily within the unit thus while providing such private storage space within the limits of the unit is not precluded it shall be over and above that which would otherwise be provided within the unit iii if such space is located within a common area within the project the association shall be responsible for the care and maintenance of the exterior surface of the space in order to assure that the surface is maintained in a manner compatible with the architectural treatment of the project regardless of the location the precise architectural treatment of such space shall be approved by the planning department to ensure that such areas are safe

national bureau of standards or equivalent ratings obtained from other testing procedures will require adjustment to the above rating systems  9306 condominium development criteria there are important considerations relative to each proposal for condominium usage and to each proposed site that do not lend themselves to specific development standards the following criteria shall apply to proposals for condominium usage made pursuant to the provisions of this shall serve as a basis for the evaluation of accepted and appropriate planning and architectural techniques necessary for the orderly development of the city and concurrently give substance to the policies necessary to achieve the purposes of this the project should be a comprehensive and integrated design providing its own open space offstreet parking and amenities for contemporary living insofar as the scale of the project allows open space walkways and other areas for people should be separated from parking areas driveways and other areas for automobiles b architectural unit and harmony should be achieved both within the project and between the project and the surrounding community so that the project does not constitute a disruption to the established fabric of the community c the layout of structures and other facilities should effect a conservation in street driveway curb cut utility and other public or quasipublic improvements structures should be designed to minimize within the context of accepted architectural practice the consumption of natural resources either directly or indirectly ie gas water electricity d the project should be designed to maintain as much of the natural topography large trees and environment as practicable e the configuration and orientation of the project should respect reasonable design limits imposed by the natural and manmade environment structures should be situated to take advantage of view topography sun and wind while at the same time not destroying these advantages for adjacent properties structures should also be situated to minimize or buffer any undesirable characteristics of the site such as street noise and nearby obnoxious commercial or industrial uses f the layout of units and open space within the project should establish use of structure and landscape materials a perceptible spatial transition from the public street semiprivacy of the common areas to the privacy of the unit most importantly the environment of each condominium unit should be private and free from visual audible and other intrusions 9307 declaration of covenants  conditions and restrictions to achieve the purpose of this the declaration of covenants conditions and restrictions relating to the management of the common area and facilities shall accompany all

development project type eg residential development project replacing existing permitted residential shall be calculated based on the following a for residential mfr studioone 1 bedroom and residential mfr all other dormitory hotel truck yard permanent structures on truck yards are only eligible for industrial credits commercial and office project types the following steps will determine the interim development impact fee balance i determine the total idif of the new development project which includes idif administrative fees ii determine the fee credit amount the fee credit shall be the existing structure net idif which is the hypothetical total idif of the existing permitted structure ie the total idif for which the existing permitted structure would be responsible if the existing permitted structure was a new development project subject to the idif minus the administrative fee iii subtract the fee credit ie the existing structure net idif from the total idif of the new development project to determine the idif balance due total idif of new development project  existing structure net idif   idif balance due b for recreational and industrialbusiness park project types the following steps will determine the interim development impact fee balance i determine the building volume of existing permitted structure as specified on the citys fee credit approval letter from the demolition permit application ii calculate building volume of new development project in general this means multiply the total building footprint by the average weighted building height to most accurately determine actual building volume final volume is measured in cubic feet iii determine the net building volume ie the increase in building volume if any arising from the new development project by subtracting the building volume of existing permitted structure from the building volume of the new development project new development project building volume  existing structure building volume   net building volume iv divide the net building volume by the average weighted new building height to get the idif applicable floor area of the building footprint ie the increase in square footage of the first floor v add the idif applicable floor area of the building footprint to all other building areas other building areas meaning second floor and above including any mezzanine areas to obtain total idif applicable square footage vi multiply total idif applicable square footage by idif rates to obtain final total idif balance 5 fee credits calculations for demolition change in development project type interim development impact fee balance total interim development impact fees including administrative fees less any fee credits for development projects replacing an existing permitted structure with a development project type that is different from the existing permitted structure eg industrial building converting to commercial shall be calculated based on the following steps a determine the total idif of the new development project which includes idif administrative fees b determine the fee credit amount the fee credit shall be the existing structure net idif which is the hypothetical total idif of the existing permitted structure ie the total idif for which the existing permitted structure would be responsible if the existing structure was a new development project subject to the idif minus the administrative fee c subtract the fee credit ie the existing structure net idif from the total idif of the new development project to determine the idif balance due total idif of new development project  existing structure net idif   idif balance due  11801 fee credits based on construction of public facilities if a developer constructs public facilities to
