purpose a the city finds and determines that 1 the practice of targeted residential picketing has the potential to incite breaches of the peace and may negatively affect the safety of the residents of those areas in which the targeted residential picketing occurs 2 many opportunities exist for individuals to exercise their important free speech rights in the city and to communicate their message without resorting to targeted residential picketing such as picketing in front of city hall and other government buildings picketing on sidewalks in commercial areas picketing in public parks and open space residential solicitation canvassing and proselytizing 3 targeted residential picketing harasses and intimidates the residents of the targeted homes their neighbors and their guests rendering them captive audiences causing them emotional distress and making them fearful of going outside and enjoying the neighborhood 4 targeted residential picketing is inherently and unreasonably offensive to and intrusive upon residents right to privacy in their homes 5 targeted residential picketing is especially harmful and unreasonable because it forces the residents of the targeted home and their neighbors into the role of a captive audience for the message of the picketers while the residents and neighbors are in their private homes a location in which the residents and their neighbors have the highest constitutional interest in being free from unwanted intrusions 6 the us supreme court has recognized the particularly harmful effects of targeted residential picketing on captive audiences and the colorado supreme court has recognized the particularly intrusive nature of speech to captive audiences 7 targeted residential picketing that occurs after dark or early in the morning increases the intrusion on the privacy and sanctity of the home is particularly harassing and intimidating and increases the potential for breaches of the peace 8 picketers interests in conducting targeted residential picketing after dark is greatly reduced because the signs held by picketers are less visible the picketers themselves are less visible and the communicative value of the picketing activity is significantly diminished 9 unlike residential solicitation in which individuals use the sidewalks streets and public rightsofway temporarily to access private residences individuals conducting targeted picketing remain on the sidewalks streets and public rightsofway which after dark results in a substantially heightened risk of traffic conflicts between picketers and vehicles on the streets 10 the carrying of signs of a certain size on sidewalks streets and public rightsofway in residential areas would block or inhibit the free movement of individuals on such sidewalks streets and public rightsofway 11 this which imposes reasonable time place and manner restrictions on the practice of targeted residential picketing is the least intrusive method for the city to prevent the substantial negative effects of targeted residential picketing b based on the foregoing findings the purpose of this to protect and preserve the sanctity of the home and residents privacy rights in their homes including allowing citizens to enjoy a feeling of wellbeing tranquility and privacy in their homes and neighborhoods without suppressing free speech rights or any particular viewpoint    definitions

city council finds that dedications of real property to the city and exactions in the form of monetary payments to the city in lieu of real property dedications should be required in those instances where the city council determines that a proposed development will create the need for new public facilities or services or will result in increased use of existing public facilities or services so as to require the expansion or eventual replacement of such facilities or services b purpose where a cause and effect relationship or essential nexus is identified between the proposed development and the resultant need for additional public facilities or services it is the purpose of this division to provide a mechanism whereby dedications and exactions can be quantified to assure that a fair and equitable proportionality is established between the cost of the public facilities or services attributable to the proposed development and the overall cost of such public facilities or services c interpretation in interpreting this division the city shall fairly balance the needs of the public and especially city residents against the need for the public facilities or services which is created by the proposed development so as not to burden disproportionately the general public with costs or expenses to provide public facilities or services the need for which is generated by the proposed development     authority the city council following public hearings before both the planning and zoning commission and the city council in conjunction with an application for rezoning subdivision pud or building permit is authorized to require exactions and dedications such dedications and exactions may include without limitation 1 dedication of real property for the construction reconstruction reconfiguration widening or extension of streets or accelerationdeceleration lanes or payment for all or a portion of the construction of streets including without limitation the widening improvement traffic signalization or construction of accelerationdeceleration lanes  2 dedication of real property for public parks  3 dedication of real property for the construction reconstruction extension or maintenance of recreational trails  4 dedication of real property for open space  or 5 payment of funds in lieu of any of the foregoing dedications    criteria a generally the city council shall be guided by the overriding principle that an exaction or dedication is unfair disproportionate and unconstitutional if it imposes a burden on an applicant which in equity and fairness should be borne by the public in general however an exaction or dedication is constitutional if the failure of the applicant to provide the dedication or exaction would fail to remedy a public problem created or exacerbated by the development to such an extent that the governing body would be justified in denying approval of the application b specifically a dedication or exaction will be required if the city council finds that 1 a legitimate identifiable public purpose is served by the required exaction or dedication  2 the city is acting within its power to provide the facility or service for which the exaction or dedication is required either directly or indirectly for the benefit of city residents  3 the projected use of the public facilities or services generated by the proposed development are contributing causes to the need for the new or expanded public facilities or services  4 the city would be legally justified in denying approval of the development unless the exaction or dedication is imposed because of the negative effect of the proposed development on either existing private property or public facilities or services  5 the city acting within its lawful authority requires all applicants similarly situated to provide similar or roughly similar exactions and dedications in both quantity and quality  and 6 the exaction or dedication will serve the proposed development directly  provided that the fact that the exaction or dedication will also serve as a general benefit to all city residents shall not constitute a valid basis for failing to impose the exaction or dedication    determination a upon a determination by the city that exactions and dedications may lawfully be required the amount of such exactions and dedications shall be determined using one 1 of the following methods 1 the applicant may accept the citys determination of the appropriate exactions and dedications if an applicant accepts the citys determination no public hearing on the exactions and dedications shall be required and the applicant shall be deemed to have waived any right to challenge such exactions and dedications at any time 2 the applicant may request in writing that an individualized study be made relating solely to its project to determine whether exactions and dedications will be required and if so the amount thereof such study shall fairly and accurately delineate the needs for public services and facilities which will be generated by the development and shall consider the criteria in b the individualized study described in paragraph a2 hereof may be prepared by either of the following methods 1 the applicant may prepare the study at its sole cost and expense upon the submission of the study the applicant shall pay the fee established by resolution of the city council to cover the citys time reviewing the study 2 upon the written request of the applicant the city shall cause to be prepared an individualized study to be completed within one hundred eighty 180 days of receipt of the written request the applicant shall reimburse the city for the cost of the study c if an individualized study is prepared the staff shall review the study and comment thereon in writing to the planning and zoning commission and the city council if the applicant agrees with the study the study shall be submitted as a joint recommendation if the applicant disagrees with the study the applicant may at his or her sole expense submit to the planning and zoning commission and the city council a written report outlining his or her reasons for disagreement d based on the individualized study the staff comments and testimony at the public hearing the planning and zoning commission shall recommend to the city council an appropriate amount of exactions and dedications e the city council shall consider the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission the study the staff comments and testimony and shall apply the criteria in to determine the amount of exactions and dedications required the decision of the city council shall be final subject only to judicial review      division 4  vesting of property rights definition only
