 18 charter of the city of rochester  18 c21 part b judicial warrants for inspections of premises  19 purpose and authority  1 ll no 32009 in order to promote the health and safety of its residents and visitors the city enforces numerous laws relating to the construction alteration maintenance repair operation use condition or occupancy of a premises these laws include laws such as the new york state uniform fire prevention and building which the city is required to enforce on behalf of the state in many instances enforcement is possible only conducted in or on the premises itself most owners and occupants of a premises consent to necessary inspections and when violations are found promptly make corrections necessary to bring the premises into compliance with applicable codes however the city has recently encountered increasing numbers of owners andor occupants who do not allow fail to schedule or unduly delay inspections the city has particularly found this to be the case in the enforcement of provisions significantly affecting the health or safety of city tenants such as the lead based paint poisoning prevention found in of the property conservation city cannot allow the enforcement of these important health and safety codes to rest upon the desires of the owner or occupant of the premises the enforcement of these provisions is especially important to a large number of residents of the city such as children the disabled and the elderly who may be unable to recognize the dangers in their premises or to take the necessary steps to protect themselves the united states supreme court and the new york state court of appeals have recognized the right of persons to require a warrant for inspections of premises in certain circumstances and have established standards for the issuance of such warrants while new york courts have issued warrants for the inspection of premises on the basis of the supreme court and new york court of appeals decisions and have applied in part the procedures for search warrants established in the criminal procedure law new york state statutes do not establish specific procedures or requirements for the issuance of warrants for inspections of premises in the absence of state statutes the city wishes to establish guidelines which meet constitutional requirements for the issuance by the courts of judicial warrants for the inspection of premises within the city such guidelines are particularly appropriate in the city due to absentee ownership of a significant number of premises the age of city housing and the difficulty in obtaining consent for necessary inspections the guidelines will provide a process for issuing such warrants and will apprise landlords tenants and all persons of the procedures and requirements to be followed by the city in obtaining and executing inspection warrants these provisions will promote the health safety and welfare of the city and all of its residents and visitors authority for the adoption of such guidelines is found in but not limited to the home rule and police powers found in of the new york state constitution  10 of the municipal home rule law and  20 of the general city

divided by two the average depth of other lots shall be determined as follows  35 equalized frontage in this section lots are classified according to whether the frontage is on one street two streets three or more streets the term street as used in this section means a highway 25 feet or over in width and the term alley means a highway less than 25 feet in width an alley is not to be considered as a street in following the above mentioned classification if a lot fronts on a street an alley or on both a street or an alley the equalized frontage on either the street or the alley is to be computed according to the rules given for lots fronting on one street only if a lot fronts on two or more streets and an alley the alley is to be disregarded in computing the equalized frontages on the streets and the equalized frontage on the alley is to be computed as for a lot fronting on one street only portions of lots to a depth of 250 feet only are to be considered if a lot exceeds this depth and is irregular draw a line 250 feet from the street line parallel thereto and consider this line as the rear of the lot in computing its equalized frontage in computing equalized frontages appropriate depth factors shall be selected from the tables of depth factors hereinafter set forth curved lines in lot boundaries shall be approximated by straight lines enclosing approximately the same area as the actual lot boundaries the equalized frontages of lots or portions thereof of the following descriptions shall be computed respectively as follows a drop perpendiculars from the extremities of the rear lot line to the street line if the rear lot line is a straight line the average depth of such lot is the sum of the lengths of such two perpendiculars divided by two if the rear lot line is not straight compute the area of the figure bounded by the rear lot line the perpendiculars and the street line and divide such total area by the distance between the perpendiculars measured alone the street line and the quotient will be the average depth of the lot a on one street only 1 regular lot multiply the actual frontage by the depth factor for the average depth of the lot as given in the table of depth factors for regular lots 2 triangular lot with base at street line multiply the actual frontage by the depth factor for the depth of the triangle as given in the table of depth factors for triangular lots base at street line 3 triangular lot with apex at street line multiply the base the side opposite the apex by the depth factor for the average depth of the lot as given in the table of depth factors for triangular lots apex at  34 assessment method local  35  street line if the base is not parallel to the street line project it on the street line by drawing lines perpendicular to the street line and use this projected distance instead of the base to multiply by the depth factor for the average depth of the lot as given in the table of depth factors for triangular lots apex at street line 4 lot removed from street line if a lot other than a triangle with apex at street line is so removed from the street line that it has no side fronting thereon connect it to the street line by straight lines drawn at right angles to the street line forming a figure enclosing the lot and an additional area compute the equalized frontage of the figure so formed and separately compute the equalized frontage of the additional area by the rules given in this section the difference between such equalized frontages will be the equalized frontage for the lot 5 irregular lot divide such a lot by straight lines drawn at right angles to the street line into portions conforming to one or more of the following descriptions compute the equalized frontage of each portion by the foregoing rules the sum of such equalized frontages is the equalized frontage for the whole lot b on two streets only 1 corner lots and unequal frontages if the actual frontages of a corner lot are unequal to the extent that the shorter frontage is 60% or less of the larger frontage the equalized frontage on each street shall be computed as follows a on the street with the shorter actual frontage draw a line parallel to the street line and 100 feet distant therefrom including the lot or a portion thereof compute the equalized frontage as for a lot fronting on one street only according to the rules contained in earlier subsections of this section using only the lot or portion thereof included between the street line and said line so drawn b on the street with the longer actual frontage draw a line parallel to the street line and 100 feet distant therefrom including the lot or portion thereof compute the equalized frontage as far a lot fronting on one street only using only the lot or portion thereof included between the street line and said line so drawn subtract the actual frontage of the lot on the other street the shorter actual frontage or 50 feet whichever is the lesser 2 corner lots with frontages equal or approximately equal if the actual frontages of a corner lot are equal or approximately equal so that the shorter frontage is more than 60% of the longer then the equalized frontage on each street is computed as follows  35 rochester code  35  a draw a line bisecting the angle between the two streets dividing the lot into two portions compute the equalized frontage on either street as for a lot fronting on one street only using only the portion of the lot as divided by aforesaid angle bisecting line adjacent to such street 3 through lots divide such a lot into two portions by a line drawn equidistant from the two street frontages the equalized frontage on either street is to be computed by the foregoing rules for lots fronting one street only using only the portion of the lot as divided by the aforesaid equidistant line which is adjacent to such street c on three or more streets 1 draw lines bisecting each angle formed by streets intersecting at a corner of such a lot terminate each angle bisecting line at its intersection with another such line draw lines equidistant from each pair of opposite nonadjacent street frontages terminate each equidistant line at its intersection with an angle bisecting line with the lot divided in portions by aforesaid lines compute the equalized frontage on any street as for a lot fronting on one street only using only the portions of the lot adjacent to such street 2 the following tables are the tables of depth factors to be used as herein provided table of depth

of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites b during the construction process soil is the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water this eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates maintenance andor repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of waterways in addition clearing andor grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of the city of rochester improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow regulation of land disturbance activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development c as a result the purpose of this to safeguard public health protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement 374 editors note this renumbered former art iv  39401 and

regulate in coastal areas subject to coastal flooding and erosion land use and development activities so as to minimize or prevent damage or destruction to manmade property natural protective features or other natural resources and to protect human life c regulate new construction or placement of structures in order to place them a safe distance from areas of active erosion and the impacts of coastal storms to ensure that these structures are not prematurely destroyed or damaged due to improper siting as well as to prevent damage to natural protective features and other natural resources d restrict public investment in services facilities or activities which are likely to encourage new permanent development in erosion hazard areas e regulate the construction of erosion protection structures in coastal areas subject to serious erosion to assure that when the construction of erosion protection structures is justified their construction and operation will minimize or prevent damage or destruction to manmade property private and public property natural protective features and other natural resources a is prone to erosion from action of lake ontario such erosion may be caused by the action of waves currents running along the shore and winddriven water and ice such areas are also prone to erosion caused by the wind runoff of rainwater along the surface of the land or

the parks of beverages in glass bottles or glass containers contributes directly and significantly to serious health and safety problems since glass beverage bottles or containers are the most common type of glass which is disposed of improperly and becomes broken in the parks broken glass beverage bottles or containers are often not properly cleaned up and parks personnel cannot always be available when such glass becomes broken such broken glass in grassy and other areas of the parks is also often difficult to discover and completely clean up thereby posing a danger not only to minors who may not be aware of the dangers of broken glass but also to unsuspecting adults the council finds that most beverages are either readily accessible in andor easily transferable into nonglass

property care of  9044  article iii leadbased paint poisoning prevention added 12202005 by   9050 policy and intent it is the policy of the city of rochester to help prevent the poisoning of its residents by requiring that the presence of deteriorated leadbased paint on the interior and exterior of pre1978 residential structures and on the exterior of pre1978 nonresidential structures be identified and be correctly addressed by reducing and controlling leadbased paint hazards which may be present in order to prevent human exposure to such hazards  9051 legislative findings a lead poisoning poses a serious public health threat to children and adults in the city of rochester b younger children are particularly susceptible to the hazards of leadbased paint since their bodies are still developing fetuses are also vulnerable to the effects of leadbased paint because pregnant women can transfer lead to their fetuses which can result in adverse developmental effects c a small amount of lead can cause elevated blood lead levels resulting in serious and irreversible developmental damage particularly in children under the age of six years d exposure to lead hazards from deteriorated leadbased paint is a primary cause of elevated blood lead levels in humans e structures built before 1978 are the most likely to contain leadbased paint hazards f residential properties are more likely than are nonresidential properties to be a source of exposure to leadbased paint hazards by children g children living in older poorly maintained homes are disproportionately at risk for leadbased paint hazards h the exposure to leadbased paint hazards in the city of rochester is most common and presents the most serious risk to young children residing in rental housing built before 1978 i it is essential to the overall public health of persons in the city of rochester and particularly for children younger than six years of age that they be protected from exposure to leadbased paint hazards 490 editors note this ordinance also provided for the renumbering of former art iii penalties and severability comprising  9045 and 9046 as art iv  9070 and 9071 it provided an

of the council are familiar with the city the locations of sexually oriented businesses in the city and the issues raised by those types of businesses in the city and throughout the country the mayor and council are also cognizant that aids hepatitis and other sexually transmitted diseases are serious health concerns in the local community based on the mayor and councils local knowledge and

report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the mayor and council find 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are not properly controlled by the operators of the establishments further there are not adequate legal provisions making the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 employees of sexually oriented businesses engage in or may be requested to engage in sexual behavior as a result of the type of employment in which they are engaged 3 sexual acts including masturbation occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 the entertainment offered at sexually oriented businesses often encourages sexual activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activities within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 communicable diseases may be spread by sexual activities including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus hiv aids hepatitis b and venereal diseases 7 aids hiv hepatitis b and venereal diseases are serious health concerns in the local community 8 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to regulate those activities and maintain those facilities 9 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in certain areas of sexually oriented businesses particularly where persons view adult oriented films or adult entertainment and similar findings have been made in sexually oriented businesses in the city in addition an adult theater in the city has been the setting for sexual acts and live performers in sexually oriented businesses in the city have performed acts of  981 reserved  981  masturbation in front of customers for pay and have encouraged the customers to do the same and have performed lap dances for customers andor encouraged touching of or by customers while they were in various stages of undress 10 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the substantial governmental concerns raised by the various findings herein 11 a licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 12 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or participants and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 13 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in assuring that the sexually oriented business is operated appropriately 14 it is desirable in the prevention of illegal activities and the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 15 the fact that an applicant for an adult license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in sexually oriented businesses in which sexual activities often occur 16 the barring of such individuals from association with adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to unwanted sexual activities 17 regulations separating the performers who appear nude or seminude in sexually oriented businesses from the patrons or customers protect the performers reduce the

do not interfere with the content of any performance 18 information from the rochester police department shows that acts of prostitution have frequently occurred in body rub parlors in the city and that licensing provisions have not been effective in controlling such activities and the council thus determines that body rubs should only be conducted for compensation by certain licensed professionals or athletic trainers 19 the council further determines that sexual encounter centers as defined herein do not serve a legitimate purpose offer a location at which sexual activities and acts of prostitution can readily occur and provide a location at which sexually transmitted diseases may be spread the council thus determines that sexual encounter centers should be prohibited 20 the council further determines that adult hotels or motels as defined herein offer a location at which sexual activities and acts of prostitution can readily occur due to the offering of shortterm or

development and redevelopment in the ccd and will provide additional criteria for site plan review and approval the principles and objectives shall be to a the ccd is intended to foster a vibrant safe twentyfourhour center city by encouraging residential development while retaining and further developing a broad range of commercial office institutional public cultural and entertainment uses and activities the regulations are intended to define and promote the center city as the anchor for the region and as a desirable place to live work and recreate b designbased criteria are established to maintain the historical and architectural character of the center city and to guide future development that is compatible and harmonious with that character the criteria and base district represent a clear and easily recognized boundary and point of transition from the character and land uses of the surrounding neighborhoods c design districts are established in specific areas based on a predominant and easily recognized character or theme that is selfcontained within identifiable boundaries the districts define areas having or proposed to have specific architectural features or design elements that make them unique in relation to other areas in the center city a develop center city as the dynamic cultural economic governmental and institutional center and anchor of the region b develop the genesee river as a principal feature of center city c create a welldefined accessible open space system within center city that links key public places and provides recreational opportunities and amenities d create a pedestrian circulation system that ties center city together and links the genesee river main street and key attractions destinations e reduce the barrier effect and negative impacts of certain physical features of center city both manmade and natural f create a series of identifiable and recognizable center city gateways that provide access into and city  12057 reserved  12058   12059 rationale for the design criteria the following activities were completed in developing the design and performance criteria for the ccd g create a series of identifiable and recognizable center city districts and neighborhoods that retain their unique history thematic functional or design characteristics and are linked or related to each other h increase the number of residents living within center city i encourage alternate modes of transportation within center city whenever and wherever possible j reestablish a retail component along the main street corridor and develop the street as the principal eastwest spine and circulation route within center city k strengthen the center city employment base and enhance the economic viability of center city l increase the number of visitorstourists both shortterm and longterm in center city m promote waterdependent and waterenhanced development along the genesee river a analysis of the form of the center city a broadbased study of the organizational structure of the center city was undertaken in order to develop an understanding of its spatial form and evolution and to identify the relationship between city form and design character based on a comprehensive background information review and an analysis of development patterns and function it was concluded that the center city is spatially defined by two dominant elements the genesee river and main street these two elements have principally defined development and circulation patterns the result is that six urban areas unique in character and design quality have evolved around the genesee river and main street b analysis of the character of the center city a detailed inventory of the center city was undertaken to document the design character of the public realm and identify the specific design attributes that create it focused on the two elements which have the greatest impact on the public realm buildings and streets design attributes which were measurable and quantifiable were inventoried based on the inventory and resulting analysis areas of common character were delineated and mapped the work undertaken in this activity is described in detail in the background document book 2  design language dated march 2002 c synthesis of form and character analysis a critical evaluation of the relationship between form and design character resulted in the  12058 rochester code  12059   12060 design and performance criteria organization  12061 street definitions development of the design and performance criteria the boundary of the center city and the regulatory districts within were established by applying the results of the character analysis to the results of the form analysis the design attributes documented during the character analysis work provide the basis and rationale for the specific design criteria required in the zoning ordinance the work undertaken in this activity is described in detail in the background document book 3  design standards dated march 2002 a in addition to the base ccd a total of six regulatory districts comprise the ccd these districts include 1 riverfront district 2 main street district 3 grove place district 4 east end district 5 tower district 6 cascadecanal district b the design and performance criteria for each district are discussed separately and are independent of one another an introduction to each district describes the character to be achieved of the criteria the guiding principles behind the criteria and a description and key plan of the subdistrict boundary the introduction is followed by a detailed description of the design criteria which have been organized under the following primary headings and subheadings 1 building a district context b district

construction within the marina district to ensure that new development establishes a minimum level of architectural quality and positively contributes to the public realm no particular architectural style is mandated or prohibited  rather the architectural standards and guidelines are intended to promote harmony and help the district coalesce into a unified place this section includes both mandatory standards and advisory guidelines the advisory guidelines are intended to provide insight into some of the desired characteristics of the district while the standards set the minimum requirements for architectural quality the mandatory standards are applicable to building elements that are clearly visible from the street or any civic space this includes all public streets and civic spaces within the marina district and adjoining the marina district but does not include parking areas located in accordance with  120772e advisory guidelines are printed in italics mandatory standards are printed in normal font the architectural standards and guidelines are organized as follows 1context and architectural character 2composition and articulation 3building facade walls 4wall openings 5roofs 6projecting facade elements 7signage 1 context and architectural character  120772h reserved  120772h  where there is little context to relate to the proper response is to create a new and worthy context to achieve this goal new buildings should establish an architectural character and pattern from which future development can take its cues the creation of a unified harmonious district is more important than the individual building to this end an architecture of place is preferred over an architecture of our time charlottes past as a resort community included fantastical amusement park structures and hotels which helped make charlotte a distinctive and memorable place charlottes lost historic buildings are part of a living tradition which included buildings that spanned the vernacular to classical spectrum from simple wood frame structures to elaborate masonry and stucco buildings rendered in exotic architectural styles the standards and guidelines that follow are largely based upon principles that underlie this living tradition the intent is not to replicate historic buildings but to encourage a range of architectural expressions that will once again establish charlotte and the marina district as a distinctive and memorable place 2 composition and articulation it is likely that most of the buildings in the marina district will be constructed at a larger scale both horizontally and vertically than any previous buildings in charlotte large structures can be monolithic monotonous and lacking in human scale this can be avoided of composition and proportion  each composition should be conceived as a whole assembled from composite parts which in turn are wholes composed of smaller parts   each building mass and facade composition should have a strong focus or center the focus need not be at the geometric center of the composition and the composition need not be symmetrical   each composition should have a readily definable base middle and top and left middle and right   parts of the composition should be joined by transitional elements that both separate and link adjacent parts   120772h rochester code  120772h   some elements of the composition should be dominant while others are subordinate this establishes a hierarchy which is a defense against the monotony of simple repetition a horizontal transitions building facades shall have horizontal transitions a horizontal transition is an architectural element such as a cornice balcony gallery or change in material that creates a distinction between the first and second stories or between the second and third stories horizontal transitions are not required in buildings with noncommercial frontages b roof lines building facades shall have roof lines a roof line is an architectural element such as a cornice parapet or change in material which creates a distinction between the top of the building and the lower stories horizontal transitions and roof lines are the means to achieve a distinctive horizontal base occupied middle and top that complement and balance one another c vertical articulations building facades shall have vertical articulations vertical articulations can be produced by variations in roof lines window groupings applied facade elements such as piers or pilasters bay windows and balconies entrance stoops and porches and subtle changes in materials and vertical planes that create shadow lines and textural differences  each building should have a clear and harmonious pattern of vertically oriented facade elements that break up long monolithic walls and divide the composition into one or more segments each with a discernible left middle and right a balance of vertical and horizontal lines should be sought with the balance tipped slightly to the vertical  changes in vertical planes should be part of a larger facade composition and should not be used to present a false image of individual buildings where separate buildings abut the principal planes of the facades should be flush 3 building facade walls  120772h reserved  120772h  a finish materials each building facade may have two or more finish materials street walls shall

groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare b the continued existence of certain nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the comprehensive plan and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is often desirable other nonconformities may continue to exist and afford adaptive reuse opportunities that can contribute to neighborhood character diversity and services c the regulations of this article are intended to restrict further investments that would make nonconformities more permanent in their location in inappropriate districts as well as to afford opportunities for creative use and reuse of those other nonconformities that contribute to a neighborhood and are consistent with the goals of the comprehensive plan d restrictions and standards are established for nonconforming uses of land and of structures designed for a permitted use  nonconforming uses of structures not designed for a permitted use  nonconforming structures  nonconforming lots of record  and nonconforming signs e in the cases of nonconforming signs where the degree of incompatibility is frequently great the

in a c1 neighborhood center district beyond the hours of 6 am to 11 pm question what means of relief is available to extend the hours of operation of barrestaurant permitted and established under the 1975 where under the 2003 bar restaurant located in a c1 district requires a special permit and may only operate during the hours of 6 am to 11pm facts the barrestaurant was located in a c1 district prior to  and operated between the hours of 6am  11pm under the 1975 use was permitted as of right in the c1 zone and a special permit was required to extend the hours of operation the subject property is located in a c1 district under the 2003 zoning under the terms of the 2003 barrestaurants are specially permitted uses in the c1 neighborhood district when operated between the hours of 6am and 11pm there is no special permit provision to extend the hours of operation beyond 6am  11pm a use variance would be required to establish a new barrestaurant operating beyond the hours of 6am  11pm analysis the subject use existed on the effective date of the 2003 zoning hence does not have a special permit since it previously operated as of right in the c1 district under the 1975 definition of a nonconforming use is as follows any use lawfully being made of any land building or structure including an accessory use on the effective date of this or any amendment to it rendering such use nonconforming which does not comply with all of the regulations of this or any amendment hereto governing use for the zoning district in which such land building or structure is located the use as it exists at this point in time does not comply with all of the regulationsgoverning use for the zoning district in which suchbuildingis located  the fact that the use preexisted the requirement for a special permit although otherwise conforming puts it into the category of a nonconforming use pursuant to b4a of the 2003 zoning the expansion of a legally existing nonconforming use requires an area variance  int1 reserved  int1  an extension of the hours of operation of a preexisting nonconforming barrestaurant use in a residential district requires an area variance it would be inconsistent to require a use variance in a commercial district but require an area variance in a residential district for a similar extension of use it would also be contrary to the goal of controlling nonconforming uses to require a use variance which would confer a permanent right to the use while the nonconforming hours of operation extension by area variance maintains the nonconforming status of the use determination therefore an area variance to expand a nonconforming use is required to extend the hours of operation for a bar restaurant in a c1 district which had existed as of right under the 1975 which is specially permitted under the 2003 arthur ientilucci director of zoning _________________________________ date  int2 interpretation 010304 interpretation 010304 subject administrative adjustment authority to permit chain link fencing in front yards issue date  situation requiring interpretation application to permit front yard chainlink fencing by administrative adjustment where the proposed fence exceeds the threefoot maximum height by more than 10% question in deciding on an administrative adjustment to permit chainlink fencing in a front yard can the director of zoning allow for a fourfoot height if the existing chainlink fencing on the frontage is four feet high facts chainlink fencing is prohibited in front yards fence height in front yards is limited to a maximum of three feet the zoning board of appeals is authorized to hear and decide on variance applications of these standards  int1 rochester code  int2  the director of zoning has the authority to issue an administrative adjustment to permit chain link fencing in front yards of neighborhoods where there is a substantial amount of legally existing chainlink fencing on a frontage  120191a4c  the director of zoning has the authority to issue administrative adjustments relative to height deviations of up to 10% analysis the allowance for an administrative process to allow for chainlink fencing was in deference to those neighborhoods with frontages that had a substantial amount of legally preexisting chainlink fencing typically four feet high and where a threefoot high wooden or other type of decorative fencing would be out of context the intent of the is to halt the proliferation of chainlink fencing in front yards throughout the city while providing a reasonable less complex and less expensive process to waive the requirements in areas where the existing context so dictates given the intent of the the fact that most preexisting front yard chainlink fencing is four feet in height the director of zoning should be able to issue the administrative adjustment for a fourfoothigh chainlink fence in a front yard where it would be in context with existing fencing not only in material composition but in terms of height as well the alternative is to allow the chainlink fence by administrative adjustment but then require the zoning board of appeals to approve the height variance application this would make the process lengthier more cumbersome and more costly than a typical variance application this is contrary to the intent of the permit flexibility of process for contextual chain link fencing determination the director of zoning in approving an administrative adjustment for front yard chainlink fencing may permit a height in excess of 10% of the maximum allowed three feet where the existing legally built fencing in the area has been established at that height  _________________________________ arthur ientilucci director

office analysis in 198 while on contract with the city of rochester mack consulting associates completed a citywide historic resources survey the survey includes the identification of all properties listed on the national register of historic places and those that appear to meet the criteria for listing the survey was prepared in accordance with federal standards for locating and identifying historic properties and the secretary of the interiors standards and guidelines for archaeology and historic preservation this list was accepted by the nys historic preservation office shpo as the city of rochesters historic resources inventory and incorporated it in its entirety into the shpo data base the mack survey was updated in 2000 resulting in additional properties being recommended for inclusion into the city of rochester historic resources survey determination the city of rochesters historic resources survey as referenced in the definition of designated buildings of historic value per of the zoning is comprised of all the properties listed in the mack survey together with the properties listed in the document entitled historic resources survey 200 recommended properties these
