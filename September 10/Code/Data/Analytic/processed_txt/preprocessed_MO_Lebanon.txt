services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood  91310

ordinance  336 et seq  buildings and building regulations ch 6  planning and development ch 17 state law reference zoning and planning in cities rsmo ch 89 title intent and purpose a  title these regulations may be referred to as the zoning ordinance of the city of lebanon missouri b  intent and purpose 1 these regulations have been based upon the comprehensive plan for the city of lebanon missouri said comprehensive plan included estimates of population growth land use surveys a land use plan plans for major thoroughfares other transportation facilities community facilities public services and utilities and a public works program 2 need for public services and facilities in both size and location depends upon the character and intensity of land use regulation of the use of land is thus fundamental to a coordinated optimum physical development of the community the land use regulations are intended to be the foundation of the entire process of improvement of the physical environment 3 the regulations are intended to preserve and protect existing property uses and values against adverse or unharmonious adjacent uses 4 the land use regulations divide the area into a number of zoning districts a the comprehensive plan included careful estimates of the land area requirements for the various land uses such as commerce residence industry transportation and public uses these urban uses should be directed into that land area where they may be most efficiently served by public services and facilities such as sewers water schools parks and the like remaining lands should be reserved for rural uses consequently the regulations include a rural district for nonurban land uses b in the past residential neighborhoods have deteriorated because they were invaded by small isolated commercial uses and by more intensive residential uses such as duplexes or apartment buildings the great majority of our population desire to and do live in singlefamily homes which they own and which are located on fairly large lots the regulations establish residential districts particularly designed to provide maximum protection for singlefamily homes c twofamily and multiplefamily uses are permitted as conditional uses in residential and commercial districts density yard and parking regulations would insure good living conditions in these areas much of present day building is by large projects instead of lot by lot the regulations provide for planned unit developments which may be located in any district with approval of the site plan this introduces an important measure of flexibility into the regulations d commercial districts recognize the different types of commercial areas that will be needed by the future growth of the community there is a central commercial district for the downtown area and a district for commercial areas along major streets and highways e for industry there are two districtsa light industrial district for nonobnoxious manufacturing and a general or unrestricted industrial district f the regulations are reasonable in relation to existing conditions yard dimensions are adjusted to peculiarities of existing lots are now too small may be used nonconforming uses are permitted to continue for adequate time periods g all uses are required to provide their own offstreet parking with a few exceptions over a period of years enforcement of this requirement will enable streets to be used primarily for traffic movement h each of the regulations has been designed to work harmoniously with the others with the totality providing that minimum degree of land use control essential to the realization of the optimum urban environment districts and boundaries a  districts the city of lebanon missouri is

regulations may be referred as the access management  of the city of lebanon list of guidelines the following table provides a listing and rationale for the guidelines included in this document access management guidelines what it means why it is important distance between major atgrade intersections the minimum distance or spacing between types of roadways eg between two major streets preserves traffic flow and ensures that a functional hierarchy of roads in maintained distance between traffic signals the minimum and desirable spacing between signals ensures efficient traffic flow on signalized arterials too many signals placed too close together will disrupt traffic flow auxiliary lanes dedicated left and right turning lane guidelines the traffic conditions under which turning lanes should be provided to serve a commercial or industrial driveway or street some high volume driveways should have dedicated left or right turn lanes to reduce conflicts with guideline on using twoway leftturn lane twltl when twltls should be used and when raised medians should be used instead twltls are far less controversial than raised medians  however twltls do not function well once a certain traffic volume range has been reached guidelines for using three lane twltl crossingsection the three land road may perform better than a four lane undivided roadway under the right circumstances three lane roads are a relatively new concept that may be an economical solution to some access problems driveway spacing and density the amount of distance between driveways and the number of driveways per unit of frontage these guidelines should vary with the roadway classification the expected land use and the speed limit for the road short spacing between driveways and high driveway densities generate conflict points that in turn lead to higher crash rates and more traffic congestion corner clearance and clearance of the functional areas of intersections the minimum distance allowed between an intersection and the first driveway insufficient corner clearance is a major cause of accessrelated crashes sight distance standards the sight distance conditions under which a driveway should not be allowed a driveway opening where there is insufficient sight distance is inherently dangerous driveway geometric guidelines the width turning radius throat length approach angle grade and surfacing requirements for driveways these can very by the expected land use served by the driveway and the roadway classifications insufficient driveway geometrics lead to slow driveway entrance and exit speeds this leads to conflicts between turning and driveway geometric design can help or hinder pedestrians and bicyclists parking on streets vehicle parking on street rightofway street parking increases congestion and crashes on city streets as drivers pull on and off the roadway often with limited visibility b  purpose and policy to define policy and procedure to improve traffic flow and safety on existing city streets as development occurs and vehicle traffic increases many roadways deteriorate into highly congested routes that experience unacceptable delays and crashes this deterioration can be due in part to improperly spaced and designed intersections and driveways these intersections and driveways cause crashes and conflicts to roadways serve a dual purpose of providing a means of transport between one place and another and providing access to adjacent property access management is intended to balance the roadways role of serving with the role of providing access to property once the safety and efficient operation of a roadway is lost it is difficult and expensive to restore adding lanes to an existing route does not completely solve the problem the goals established for the development of access management guidelines for the city of lebanon include the following  improve roadway safety  improve traffic operations  protect taxpayers investment in roadways  coordinate all city planning efforts to maximize resource utilization access management involves the proper planning and design of points of access to the public roadway system these points of access include public roadway intersections and driveways sound access management can have a positive impact on roadway safety and the ability of roadways to carry traffic efficiently and safely failure to properly manage access can result in safety and operational problems negatively impact adjacent property owners and cause a loss of the publics investment in the roadway system access management on existing streets with existing driveways will only be considered at the time of a major change to traffic flows or street configuration new roadways intersecting existing roadways will be subject to these guidelines after adoption by the city council all new driveways intersections or access to city streets must be approved by the city of lebanon planning and zoning administrator and shall be granted an access permit driveway and intersection guidelines include the following  spacing for public road intersections  spacing of traffic signals  driveway spacing and density  corner clearance and clearance of functional areas of public road intersections  sight distance minimums  driveway geometric design  angle of intersection and approach radii  driveway width throat length and grade  guidelines for surfacing and curbs street classification system and access permits a  street classification map 1 the city council shall adopt a street classification map consistent with the comprehensive plan and according to the classifications as set out below this map shall be amended from time to time and shall be used to guide the decisionmaking process regarding access to public street system a principal arterial a street primarily intended to provide for highvolume moderatespeed traffic and moderate to extended trip length traffic movement between major activity centers access to abutting property to major traffic movement and is subject to the necessary control of entrances and exits eg elm hwy 5 hwy 32 morgan etc b major arterial a street which interconnects with and augments and feeds the primary arterial system and is intended for moderate volume moderate speed traffic and short to moderate trip lengths access to abutting property is partially controlled eg beck tower etc c major collector a street which collects and distributes traffic to and from local and arterial street systems and is primarily intended to provide for lowtomoderate volume lowspeed and short length trips while also providing access to abutting property eg adams clark madison d residential collector a street which collects and distributes residential traffic between local streets and collector and arterial streets and is primarily intended for lowtomoderate volume lowspeed and short length trips while also providing access to abutting properties eg fowler deadra raef brook etc b  residentialcommercial subdivisions access permits 1 plat approved permits approval process access permit numbers assigned with building permit 2 new construction initiated accesses not approved via sub division plat ie new construction initiated after  the turnaround guildlines for approval is 5 days once application has been submitted atgrade intersections spacing a  what this guideline means the guideline governs the minimum distance or spacing between types of public roadways and their intersections this guideline provides for a hierarchy of roads and maintains adequate spacing between roads that are intended to serve collectors provide some service to but also provide direct access to property  therefore they can be placed closer together b  minimum guideline roadway classification minimum spacing principal arterial 1 mile 5280 feet major arterial 12 mile 2640 feet collector 14 mile 1320 feet residential collector 14 mile min to 12 mile max traffic signals spacing a  what this guideline means this guideline governs the distance between signalized atgrade intersections on public roadways minimum spacing is mainly intended to preserve efficient traffic flow and progression on urban arterial roadways  for instance a quarteror halfmile spacing allows traffic signals to be effectively interconnected and synchronized adequate spacing will also tend to reduce rearend collisions and stop and go driving that increases congestion delay ad air pollution in urban areas these guidelines were developed to allow for smooth operations given a 90second total traffic signal cycle length b  minimum guideline roadway classification in current and projected urban areas principal arterial 12 mile 2640 feet only advisable when traffic count warrants or special circumstances exist auxiliary turning lanes a  what this guideline means dedicated left and rightturn lanes should be provided in situations where traffic volumes and speeds are relatively high and conflicts are likely to develop at public road intersections and private driveways between turning traffic auxiliary lanes are an asset in promoting safety and improved traffic flow in such situations the use and design of any auxiliary lanes shall always be guided by a traffic study some major applications for and considerations for the design of auxiliary lanes are as follows b  installing auxiliary leftturn lanes such lanes installed in the roadway center are intended to remove turning vehicles from the flow this should reduce the frequency of rearend collisions at locations where there is considerable leftturn ingress activity such as major driveways and minor public road intersections suggested application for leftturn lanes in the median are shown in the table below a turn lane shall be considered when the leftturning volume meets or exceeds the value in the table for a posted speed posted speed limit mph leftturn volume at peak hour 35 20 45 15 the use and design of auxiliary leftturn lanes shall be guided by a traffic study in general auxiliary leftturn lanes must be long enough to accommodate a safe deceleration distance and to provide adequate storage of a queue for expected peak hour turning traffic c  installing auxiliary rightturn lanes the use of dedicated rightturn lanes shall also always be guided by a traffic study in general dedicated rightturn lanes shall be provided on two lane routes as shown in the table below when the rightturn volumes at peak hour are met or exceeded posted speed limit mph rightturn volume at peak hour 35 20 45 15 d  dedicated right turn lanes shall be considered in situations where  poor internal site design and circulation leads to backups on the mainline autooriented businesses with short driveor poorlydesigned parking lots would be prime examples of this situation  the peak hour turning traffic activity is unusually high eg greater than 10 percent of the daily total  the driveway or minor public road intersection is difficult for drivers to see  the driveway entrance is gated or otherwise must be entered very slowly  right turning traffic consists of an unusually high number of trailers or other large vehicles  the intersection or driveway angle is highly skewed  rear end collision experience is unusually high at a location as with any auxiliary turning lane dedicated rightturn lanes shall be designed based on the results of a traffic study e  width of auxiliary acceleration and turn lanes any auxiliary turning lanes such as dedicated right and left turns shall be at least 11 feet wide twelve feet is a desirable width not including the gutter threelane cross sections a  what this guideline means threelane cross sections two with a twltl in the center are a possible access management tool in certain situations such roadways are about 25 percent safer than an undivided fourlane road and can provide comparable capacity provided that intersections are well designed they work best in situations where traffic volumes are moderate and where the proportion of vehicles turning left is high twltls are best used in situations where driveway density is low to moderate eg below 24 commercial driveways per mile which equates to a spacing of about 440 feet between driveways they shall be strongly considered in multifamily residential areas or mixed land use areas especially on minor arterials and collectors this guideline does not refer to third lanes used as passing turning or climbing lanes in rural areas b  guidelines roadway classification in current and projected urban areas principal arterial not available major arterial may be used when appropriate andor where aadt in design year is less than 15000 collector may be used when appropriate andor where aadt in design year is less than 15000 residential collector not available driveway spacing a  what this guideline means this guideline governs the minimum recommended spacing between private driveways necessary to preserve both safety and traffic flow spacing between driveways must be longer on higher speed routes in rural areas than in urban areas in urban areas these guidelines allow for about one driveway per city block face on principal arterials minor arterials and two driveways per block face on collectors in order to preserve spacing direct access should be moved to local streets not arterials or shared driveways where possible in particular access for corner lots should be moved to a lower traffic side street whenever possible access can often be better accomplished on major streets means as frontage and backage roads joint access cross access and shared driveways this guideline only applies where sight distance allows driveways shall not be allowed where sight distance is inadequate even if the driveway spacing guideline would allow them driveway accesses shall be provided on local and collector streets side streets rather than arterials wherever possible driveways shall also be lined up across the public roadway from each other whenever possible when driveways are not lined up the minimum spacing shall be measured from the closest driveway on either side of the road except where a nontraversable eg raised median exists on urban routes where nontraversable medians exist shorter driveway spacing may be acceptable for rightin rightout driveways only b  minimum guideline roadway classification driveway spacing principal arterial 440 feet  major arterial 220 feet  collectors 220 feet  desirable residential collector na driveway corner clearance a  what this guideline means corner clearance represents the distance between the corner of the intersection of two public roadways and the next private driveway it is important to provide enough distance between the comer and the first driveway to effectively separate conflict points and to allow drivers enough time to make safe maneuvers when corners are not adequately cleared high crash rates tend to occur delays and traffic congestion also result when corners are not adequately cleared these guidelines correspond to the minimum driveway spacing guidelines for the same roadway classification this guideline only applies where the minimum sight distance guideline allows b  minimum guideline roadway classification corner clearance principal arterial 220 feet major arterial 220 feet collector 100 feet desirable residential collector 100 feet desirable or as far as practically possible driveway sight distance a  what this standard means sight distance for driveway construction shall be considered essential in the design and issuance of permits for all classes of driveways if there is a request to construct a driveway at a questionable location a traffic study must include an onsite inspection to evaluate the sight distance sight distance is always the most important consideration in allowing not allowing or placing driveways there are two basic concerns of responsibility when considering the sight distance requirements for any driveway the first concern is to provide maximum safety for the motoring public the second concern is to provide for access to the adjacent property owners both vertical and horizontal alignment can limit sight distance 1 how to measure vertical sight distance to measure actual sight distance limited by vertical alignment in the field place a sighting target 425 feet above and 20 feet from the edge of pavement at the proposed driveway location approximate location of a driver approaching the roadway on minor arterial and collector routes the target may be placed at a point 144 feet from edge of pavement sighting from a height of 35 feet move along the roadway away from the proposed driveway site to a point just beyond where the target disappears then move back toward the target until it can first be seen place a mark on the pavement and then measure the distance along the roadway between the mark and the target this measured distance is the vertical sight distance measurement may also be made with an accurate measuring device mounted on an automobile 2 how to measure horizontal sight distance to measure horizontal sight distance place a sighting target 425 feet above and 20 feet from the edge of pavement at the proposed driveway location on minor arterial and collector routes the target may be placed at a point 144 feet from edge of pavement move away from the target along the roadway until the target is just out of sight or the line of sight is beyond the rightofway limits the line of sight must stay within the limits of the rightofway consideration should also be given to vegetation both on the rightofway and adjacent to the rightofway as it may impede vision more during certain times of the year sighting from a height of 35 feet move along the roadway toward the target until it can first be seen and place a mark on the pavement measure the distance between the mark and the target along the roadway this measured distance is the sight distance the three sight distance categories are  design sight distance minimum sight distance and

the maximum sight distance available on the entire property frontage 2 the access management classification category for the route is minor arterial or collector 3 the proposed location is not for a public street approach or a highvolume commercial driveway 4 there is no other available access having equal or greater sight distance 5 the applicants responsibility clause is added to the permit applicant understands the presence of this driveway creates a potential sight distance problem and has been so informed in writing by the city of lebanon 6 the following clause is added to the permit in addition to the applicants responsibility clause applicant is aware that the sight distance of this driveway is severely restricted the sight distance is the minimum necessary for a vehicle traveling at the posted speed to come to a complete stop prior to the driveway if these conditions are not met the permit shall not be issued for the driveway if an appeal for the access is made it should be sent to the city engineer for additional review the applicant should be advised of work that could improve sight distance for the location such as minor grading or brush removal the city may allow the widening of a driveway with limited sight distance or may allow the relocation of a driveway with limited sight distance to a location on the property frontage with better sight distance this will be allowed on routes with normal rightofway provided there is no change in driveway usage the following responsibility clause must be added to the permit applicant understands that the existing sight distance for this driveway is less than current design standards and the driveway modification while beneficial to the property owner will not remedy the sight distance limitation c  adjustment for steep grades the sight distance standards here assume a level flat roadway on many roadways in missouri there are significant upgrades or downgrades along the road profile the aashto green book indicates that for upgrades or downgrades of up to and including three percent there is little effect of grade on stopping site distance however when an upgrade equals or exceeds four percent stopping sight distances need to be adjusted to account for the fact that vehicles entering the traffic stream will take longer to accelerate to the posted speed limit the impact of grade will be most profound for combination trucks eg the aashto wb50 design vehicle and other heavy vehicles when there is a significant upgrade eg over 4 percent that must be negotiated by an entering vehicle the adjustment factors in table 94 should be applied to the stopping sight distance tables noted above by multiplying the adjustment factor to the appropriate stopping sight distance figure when a driveway is used significant number of combination vehicles the higher of the two adjustment factors should be used table 94 adjustment factors for steep grades typical entering vehicle flat to 4% grade grades between 4% to 6% grades 6% or more passenger vehicles p and singleunit trucks su no adjustment needed 13 15 combination trucks wb50 no adjustment needed 17 22 basis adapted from the aashto policy on geometric design of highways and streets if at all possible public road intersections or highvolume private driveways should not be placed along roadway segments where the grade of the roadway exceeds six percent driveway geometrics on classified streets the design of driveways is critical in access management in that it affects the speed of traffic turning into and out of driveways this in turn affects the speed differential between turning traffic large speed differentials are created when driveways are inadequately designed large speed differentials are associated with higher crash rates and diminished traffic operations driveway designs should always be based on the results of a study of the traffic likely to use them  these guidelines are presented to illustrate good practices for driveway designs a  lining up driveways across roadways driveways should be as closely lined up with driveways across roadways without nontraversable medians to the maximum extent possible even if less spacing between driveways is the result b  angle of intersection to the public roadway 1 driveways that serve twoway traffic should have angles of intersection with the public road of 90 degrees or very near 90 degrees the minimum acceptable angle for driveways that serve twoway traffic is 70 degrees 2 driveways that serve oneway traffic may have an acute angular placement of from 60 to 90 degrees c  rightturn approach radius approach radii shall be large enough to allow entering vehicles to do so at a reasonable rate of speed the following are suggested as minimum approach radii and are measured from the edge of the driving surface of the roadway any maximum approach radius is allowable for driveways driveways types minimum right turn radius principal & major 20 feet commercial driveways 20 feet collector 15 feet inside radii should be determined on a case by case basis given driveway angle traffic volume and other relevant factors sites that generate substantial large truck traffic need inside larger radii to accommodate the wheel path of the turning trucks d  driveway width no driveways shall have widths less than 12 feet driveways of greater than 54 feet should be strongly discouraged unless they contain a raised median to separate traffic lanes driveways that serve oneway traffic shall be from 20 to 30 feet wide driveway widths shall be measured from the face of curb to the face of curb at the point of tangency any medians contained in the driveway are above and beyond the minimum widths in the table minimum
