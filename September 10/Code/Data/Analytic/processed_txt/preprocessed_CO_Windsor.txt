environment and protect the health safety and welfare of the towns inhabitants and visitors  owners of property to provide onsite drainage facilities as a condition of development in accordance with the assumptions and findings of the town of windsor master drainage plan 2017 update volumes i dated august 2017 drainage master plan the owners of property to be developed within the town shall be required as a condition of development to provide at their sole expense such onsite stormwater drainage facilities as are required by the approved development plan and necessary to mitigate the impact of such development such requirements shall include an obligation of owners of property to provide facilities necessary to convey stormwater runoff to major drainage ways since the development of elevated land can increase the amount of stormwater runoff from such land onto adjoining lands at lower elevations the owner of elevated land has the legal duty to prevent such increased runoff from doing damage to other lands which duty shall be deemed satisfied if adequate facilities are installed as required by this in determining under this facilities a landowner shall be responsible for constructing the amount of increased stormwater runoff that will result from the development shall be taken into account  stormwater drainage utility enterprise a the town board hereby recognizes and

guide only nothing in this intended nor shall it be construed to limit the discretion of the town board which retains full discretion and authority regarding the terms and limitations of all district service plans the town generally accepts the formation of districts where it is demonstrated that the formation of a district is needed to provide public services or facilities to local development and will result in a demonstrated public benefit whether such demonstrated public benefit is provided by the district or made possible to be provided by the developer because the district exists to provide public improvements 1 districts will be permitted to conduct ongoing operations and maintenance activities where it can be demonstrated that having the district provide operations and maintenance is in the best interest of the town and the existing or future residents and taxpayers of the district 2 for districts whose primary revenue source is property taxes and in the absence of special circumstances district formation will not be favorably received where the future assessed value of all property within the district at full buildout is projected to be less than five million dollars $500000000 the fivemilliondollarassessed valuation threshold for districts whose primary revenue source is property taxes will increase biennially after 2015 to adjust for increases in the

3 districts when properly structured can enhance the quality of growth in the town the town is receptive to district formation as an instrument to provide competitive financing for projects build better and enhanced infrastructure and where needed create a quasigovernmental entity to provide essential and beneficial services which are otherwise not available and could not be practically

increased or decreased to reflect such changes such increases or decreases to be determined by the district board in good faith such determination to be binding and final so that to the extent possible the actual tax revenues generated by the mill levy as adjusted are neither diminished nor enhanced as a result of such changes for purposes of the foregoing a change in the ratio of actual

bankruptcy b6 n the service plans limitations on the debt mill levy the operations and maintenance mill levy the limitation on the use of fees for public improvements and certain other financial limitations are intended to strike a balance between i providing adequate project control and revenue to the project developer to facilitate desirable development which will result in demonstrated public benefit and ii providing adequate safeguards for protection of residents and taxpayers when a district board is composed entirely of end users the balance may shift in favor of removing some of the limitations on financial powers the town board may be more inclined to remove financial limitations in scenarios where the district board wants to add public improvements which were not contemplated as part of the project developers master plan for the project eg twenty 20 years after development a neighborhood wants to renovate and expand the uses of its community center a districtowned public improvement requires significant repairs maintenance or upgrades and the cost properly rests with the district or the restructuring of debt would result in a net present value
