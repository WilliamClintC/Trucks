management and erosion control intent and purpose the purpose of this article is to diminish threats to public health safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new development and redevelopment this excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of damageable properties the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels and the pollution of valuable stream and river resources the cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and impairment of quality is the development and improvement of land and as such this article regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts this article is adopted to accomplish the following objectives 1 to assure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to others or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion  2 to protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff  3 to protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding on a watershed basis  4 to lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects repairs to flooddamaged public facilities and utilities correction of channel erosion problems and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development  5 to protect conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water resources  6 to preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats  7 to preserve the natural
