following findings regarding stormwater runoff and the citys storm sewer system a the citys existing storm sewer system consists of a network of manmade and natural facilities structures and conduits including groundwater and aquifers that collect and route stormwater runoff b the citys existing storm sewer system does not adequately handle the stormwater runoff generated in the city c the citys anticipated growth will place increased demands on the already inadequate storm sewer system d uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff causes erosion property damage and unsafe conditions e uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff may hinder the citys ability to provide emergency services to its residents f uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff impedes the regular flow of traffic in the city g uncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff may pose health hazards to the citizens of the community h all developed properties in the city contribute to the need for the storm sewer system by converting natural ground cover into impervious surfaces i all developed properties in the city make use of or benefit from the citys operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system j absent effective maintenance operation regulation and control existing stormwater drainage conditions in the city constitute a potential hazard to the health safety and general welfare of the city its residents and its businesses k a storm sewer utility is the most equitable and efficient method of managing stormwater in the city and ensuring that each property in the city pays its fair share of the amount that the property contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the storm sewer system part 1997 purpose the purpose of this ordinance is to protect the health safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants by improving the citys storm sewer system managing and controlling stormwater runoff protecting property preventing polluted waters from entering the citys water supply and other receiving waters and establishing a viable and fair method of financing the construction operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system part 1997 definitions the following words and phrases shall be defined as follows a developed parcel shall mean any parcel that has been altered from its natural condition by grading filling or the construction of improvements or other impervious surfaces b equivalent service unit esu shall mean the average amount of impervious surface expressed in square feet on developed single family residential parcels in american fork c impervious surface shall mean any hard surface other than the natural surface that prevents or retards the absorption of water into the soil or that causes water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at a greater rate of flow than the natural surface part 1997 storm sewer utility a creation the city council hereby creates and establishes a storm sewer utility as part of the citys overall sewer system the storm sewer utility shall plan design construct maintain administer and operate the citys storm sewer system b enterprise fund the city council hereby establishes a storm sewer utility enterprise fund to handle all income expenses and other financial transactions related to the storm sewer utility all storm sewer utility service charges shall be deposited in the enterprise fund money in the storm sewer utility enterprise fund shall not be commingled with or transferred to other city funds however the storm sewer utility may pay other city funds for services and expenses directly attributable to the storm sewer utility the enterprise fund shall be operated according to state law and city policy c facilities and assets the storm sewer utility shall operate independently of city operations funded by the general fund the storm sewer utility shall have the same relationship to the city as other city utilities such as the water utility and the sanitary sewer waste water utility upon creation of the utility all of the citys storm sewer facilities and assets other than streets and other facilities and assets designated by the city administrator shall be transferred to the storm sewer utility in consideration for the storm sewer utilitys agreement to take primary responsibility for planning designing constructing maintaining administering and operating the citys storm sewer system d administration the storm sewer utility shall be administered by and under the direction of the city administrator part 1997 storm sewer utility fee a imposed each developed parcel of real property in the city shall be charged a storm sewer utility fee b esu the fee shall be based on the number of equivalent service units esus contained in the parcel the city council finds that the esu is the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the storm sewer utility based upon an engineering study commissioned by the city the city council finds and establishes that one esu equals three thousand four hundred square feet of impervious surface area c calculation the city council finds that each single family residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of storm water runoff  therefore each developed single family residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one esu all nonsingle family residential parcels shall pay a multiple of this base rate expressed in esus according to the measured impervious area on the parcel the city council may adopt separate rates for residential planned unit developments puds condominiums and other uses that are not easily handled under the standard rate schedule d charge per esu the amount charged for each esu shall be established by resolution of the city council e exemptions and credits the city council may establish exemptions and credits to the storm sewer utility fee by resolution f policies the city administrator may adopt policies consistent with this ordinance and any resolutions passed by the city council to assist in the application administration

services that are part of a unified city plan to provide for the health safety and welfare of the city and its residents in an environmentally responsible manner therefore the storm sewer utility fee shall be included on the citys regular monthly utility bill for any given property if there is no regular utility bill for the property the storm sewer utility fee shall be charged to the owner of the property the fee shall be deemed a civil debt owed to the city by the person or entity paying for the city utility services provided to the property all properties shall be charged the fee failure to

takings guidelines and local appellate procedure purpose the purpose of this section is to provide advisory guidelines for the city to assist the city in identifying actions that may involve the unconstitutional taking or damaging of private real property without the payment of just compensation as required by the constitution of the united states and the constitution of the state of utah i 8122003 constitutional taking constitutional taking means governmental actions involving the physical taking or exaction or the regulatory taking of private real property by the city that might reasonably and foreseeably require compensation to a private real property owner under a the fifth or fourteenth amendment of the constitution of the united states  b of the constitution of the state of utah  andor c any recent court rulings governing the physical or regulatory taking of the private real property by a governmental entity i 8122003 policy and guidelines a it is the policy of the city that 1 any physical taking andor exaction of private real property bear an essential nexus to a legitimate governmental interest 2 any exaction be roughly proportionate and reasonably related both in nature and extent to the impact caused by the activity or activities which are the subject of the decision or action being reviewed 3 no individual bear burdens which in all fairness and justice should be borne by the community as a whole b the guidelines set forth in this section shall be considered by the city when taking any action that might reasonably and foreseeably result in the physical taking or exaction or the regulatory taking of private real property c the city should review the following to determine and identify whether a proposed government action raises constitutional taking issues 1 does the action result in a permanent or inevitably recurring physical occupation of private property 2 does the action require a property owner to dedicate property or grant an easement to the city without the payment of just compensation 3 does the action create or otherwise impose a permanent or ongoing nuisance originating on city property that impacts neighboring lands so that they sustain a special and unreasonable interference with the quiet enjoyment of their property 4 does the action interfere with a fundamental attribute of ownership such as the right to reasonable access the right to light air and view within the rightofway of a public street that abuts private property or the right to exclude others from the private property 5 does the action unreasonably interfere with a separately protected and vested right such as the right to continue a nonconforming use  the right to have an application reviewed under the law that was in effect when a complete application was submitted  or legally issued subdivision plat approvals building permits licenses  or other protected property interests 6 does the action impose a severe economic burden that is determined to be unfair when considered in light of a the burden placed on the property owner b the nature of the government action and benefit and c the property owners investmentbacked expectations 7 does the action deprive the property owner of any economically viable use of the property where there exists at least one viable use which does not constitute a nuisance or a severe threat to health and safety 8 does the action limit the use of private property without substantially advancing a legitimate public interest 9 has the city demonstrated by an individualized determination that any conditions dedications or exactions imposed on development applications place only fair and proportionate burdens on development and do not unreasonably impose burdens that significantly exceed the burdens that the proposed development places on public utilities streets and other services 10 does the action discriminate against property owners that are similarly situated to other property owners without a reasonable basis for doing so i 8122003 analysis a if the city determines that a governmental action involves constitutional taking issues the proposed decision or action should be reviewed by the city to analyze the possible taking and to determine the action to be taken b in reviewing the proposed action the following factors may be analyzed 1 the effect the potential taking would have on the use or value of the private property 2 the likelihood that the action may result in a constitutional taking 3 any reasonable practical available and financially feasible alternatives to the proposed action that may fulfill the citys lawful objectives and reduce the risk of a constitutional taking 4 the estimated cost to the city for payment of compensation if the decision or action were later determined to be a constitutional taking i 8122003 appeals a appeals of municipal impact fees are governed by the provisions of the utah impact fees act et seq utah 195 as amended and of the american fork city municipal impact fees which are hereby incorporated herein as though fully set forth b appeals of land use decisions are governed by the appeals provisions of the municipal land use development and management act et seq utah 195 as amended and the american fork city development which are hereby incorporated herein as

footnotes  1  the access management manual can be found at  introduction the following sections discuss recommended access management related standards for american fork city these recommendations are based on national and local research as well as the current stateofthepractice by other dots and municipalities  582012 _____ access provisions this section discusses what types of accesses should be permitted on the various types of roadways within american fork the roadway network and land use are interconnected therefore allowing certain types of land use and accesses adjacent to certain types of roadways will lead to the correct type of access and mobility that would be expected for a certain type of road table 1 shows recommended allowable accesses for each roadway classification table 1 access provisions street classification commercial access multifamily residential access residential access public street access arterial street yes 1 no 3 no yes major collector yes yes no 5 yes minor collector yes yes yes 4 yes local street no 2 yes yes yes notes 1 preferably commercial access to an arterial should be consolidated for several parcels and gained using a traffic signal or a public street where direct access is given to an arterial if possible the access should be a riro access 2 exceptions to this recommendation would be for small commercial developments or for secondary access to a development 3 very large multifamily developments may have private accesses that resemble public streets in form and function and therefore would be an exception to this recommendation 4 direct access and frontage of residential properties to a minor collector may result in lessthandesirable livability for residents and should be avoided where practical 5 direct access and frontage of residential properties to a major collector may result in lessthandesirable livability for residents and should be avoided where practical  however if base residential zoning allows access then a traffic impact study showing acceptable operations and safety can be mitigated then an engineering review will determine the applicability of this standard recommendations listed in table 1 may not always be feasible depending on whether or not other access exists for a given parcel of land the feasibility of these recommendations is also highly dependent upon land use and transportation planning for american fork city  582012 intersection and access spacing based on recommendations from the literature and from stateofthepractice of other municipalities and dots recommendations for minimum signalized public street and private access spacing have been compiled and are shown in table 2 table 2 access management spacing recommendations street classification minimum signal spacing feet 1 minimum street spacing feet 14 minimum commercial access spacing feet 14 minimum residential access spacing feet 1 arterial street 2640 660 330 2 na 3 major collector 1320 660 330 na 3 minor collector 1320 330 150 150 local street 1320 150 150 50 notes 1 measured centerline to centerline 2 access to an arterial should only be granted when other reasonable access is not available to a collector or local street if granted the access should be limited to rightinrightout only if possible 3 residential access should not be granted on arterials or major collectors 4 minimum street spacing refers to unsignalized intersection spacing  if a traffic signal is present a traffic impact study should determine if the minimum street spacing should be longer  582012 _____ corner clearance requirements the corner clearance requirements are the same as the minimum access spacing requirements as were shown previously in table 2 in general minimum corner clearance can be shorter on the downstream leg of the minor street at an intersection especially if the access is s riro access this distance can be as low as one hundred twenty feet for all other corner clearance distances the values in table 2 for minimum access spacing apply  582012 cross access shared access requirements access to private property from the public transportation network cannot be prohibited however when parcels have small frontages especially along major collectors and arterials it is highly recommended that the cross access andor shared access be utilized where practical where adjoining parcels have the same ownership american fork city should require the use of cross or shared access in order to maintain the recommended access spacing requirements as previously discussed when adjacent parcels do not have common ownership incentives should be provided to promote shared and cross access  582012 intersection alignmentoffsets where possible accesses on opposite sides of the street should be lined up directly across from each other sometimes this is not possible due to site restrictions or property lines if accesses cannot be lined up across from one another the preferable offset is so that left turns entering each respective access do not overlap table 3 shows the minimum offset for intersections on opposite sides of the street when the potential for overlap does occur however a traffic impact study may determine that a larger offset is required depending on the level of queuing that may occur at the intersections table 3 minimum access offset requirements street classification minimum offset feet 1 arterial street 2 310 major collector 180 minor collector 120 local street na notes 1 these values are a minimum requirement and are subject to change based on the results of a traffic impact study 2 offset requirements are not applicable in the case of riro accesses such as when a raised median is present access should only be provided to arterial streets when reasonable alternative access is does not exist  582012 _____ onstreet parking permitting onstreet parking can be a tool to make a corridor more pedestrian friendly as parked vehicles provide a buffer between pedestrians on the sidewalks vehicles parking and unparking along a roadway may cause side friction that can result in being slowed down or impeded to determine whether or not a road should have permitted onstreet parking depends primarily on what the function of the roadway is as was discussed previously the purpose of most arterial type roads is to provide mobility not access whereas the purpose of a local street is to provide access and not mobility however another important factor is adjacent land use a roadway in a core business area even if classified as an arterial can benefit from having onstreet parking where a lower classified road such as a minor collector within an industrial area may not need onstreet parking therefore the cost to build and maintain this type of road will be less expensive by prohibiting onstreet parking finally the available cross section width should also be considered when determining whether onstreet parking should be permitted a minimum of seven feet of cross section width should be provided for onstreet parking table 4 shows recommended onstreet parking provisions based on functional classification figure 1 shows onstreet parking on main street in american fork although this road is classified as an arterial the adjacent land use supports onstreet parking all parking within american fork city should be parallel except for church street center street and merchant street between main street and pacific drive and main street from 200 east to 460 east _____ table 4 onstreet parking recommendations street classification onstreet parking permitted 1 arterial street no major collector yes minor collector yes local street yes notes 1 these recommendations are based primarily on the function of the roadway adjacent land use and available cross section width are also important factors in determining whether onstreet parking should be permitted figure 1 onstreet parking is currently permitted on main street because of the adjacent land use and the available cross section width  582012 _____ access characteristics recommendations for access characteristics discussed in this section include the following  driveway width  curb return radii  vertical profile of driveway  driveway throat length  minimum separation of gate on private access from public street all recommendations in this section assume the following  the design vehicle for residential and commercial accesses is a passenger car  the design vehicle for industrial accesses is a wb50 with the exception of the north pointe business park including the price property which will be designated by the city engineer based on the type of anticipated vehicle usage although some larger vehicles such as delivery vehicles do need access to commercial areas these types of trips do not typically occur during the peak periods of the day the entire access ingress and egress side can therefore be used by a larger vehicle during offpeak times this is more efficient than utilizing more area to make larger radii and access widths and is also more ideal for pedestrians access driveways that will be heavily utilized by trucks and busses during peak periods should be designed to the industrial recommendations table 5 shows driveway widths and curb radii for various intersection types depending on the functional classification of the adjacent roadway

american fork city standards table 7 contains maximum change in grade between the crossslope of the roadway and the slope of the driveway the maximum change in grade reported is the algebraic difference in slope for example if a negative two percent crossslope connects to a positive two percent driveway slope the algebraic change in grade is four percent likewise if the crossslope is negative two percent and the driveway slope is negative six percent the algebraic change in grade is also four percent table 6 also shows the maximum change in grade where no vertical curves are required rounding only as well as the maximum change in grade with vertical curves provided table 8 shows the recommended driveway throat lengths for various access types and based on what type of conflict is closest to the adjacent road when an internal intersection will be the first conflict encountered when entering a driveway a shorter throat is typically needed then for a site where the driver will encounter parking spots after entering the access table 9 shows the minimum separation of a gate on a private access from the edge of traveled way for various design vehicles this separation is necessary so that a vehicle can park in front of the gate while it is still closed without the rear of the vehicle obstructing the flow of traffic where the possibility of queuing exists such as at a gated residential community a traffic study should be completed to determine the 95th percentile queue length during the peak hour table 7 change in driveway vertical profile access type

on aashto greenbook 2004 recommendations these recommendations are made for various intersection control scenarios as well as functional classifications of the intersecting roads additionally sight distances to accommodate trucks have also been calculated scenarios discussed in the following sections include intersection sight distance for a full access stopcontrolled intersection a riro access a yieldcontrol intersection fourleg and threeleg intersection and an uncontrolled intersection sight distance requirements for a left turn from a major street onto a minor street are also given within the provided tables for illustrative purposes all intersection sight distances should be calculated by a licensed traffic engineer and compared to the tables within this division for all of the scenarios the following assumptions have been made 1 design speeds  access fifteen mph  local thirty mph  minor collector thirtyfive mph  major collector forty mph  arterial fifty mph 2 intersections are flat all slopes are assumed three percent or less 3 cross sections  local two lanes  minor collector two lanes  major collector three lanes  arterial five lanes 4 all calculations are based on aashto greenbook 2004 assumptions because the grade of the major or minor street does affect sight distance the values presented in the sections below should be adjusted when grades are more than three percent these adjustments should be made on an individual casecase basis by consulting the aashto greenbook additionally alternative design speeds or cross sections will also require adjustments to these sight distances once intersection sight distances have been determined for a given intersection a clear sight triangle can be formed which should remain clear of anything that will obstruct the driver from seeing other vehicles within the intersection sight distance the aashto greenbook states that the minimum height of a drivers eye is approximately 35 feet the maximum height which corresponds to the driver of a combination or single unit truck is approximately 76 feet therefore objects should not be placed in the clear sight triangle between 35 and 76 feet in height objects such as buildings fences and parked cars are examples of objects that will block the intersection sight distance landscaping features such as shrubbery and decorative rocks are acceptable as long as they are less than 35 feet high trees are acceptable as long as the stump is located outside of the clear sight triangle and the lowest branches are at least 76 feet tall these height standards apply to areas with flat grade intersections near slopes must be evaluated on a casebycase basis a stopcontrolled intersections intersection site distances for stopcontrolled intersections include full movement intersections where the minor street is stopcontrolled but the major street does not stop riro intersection sight distance is also presented table 10 shows the sight distance required for fullmovement intersections table 11 shows the sight distance required for riro intersections in both cases the sight triangle for the minor leg should be twenty feet back from the edge of traveled way of the major street the value shown in the table is how far to the left and right for which the stopped vehicle should have a clear sight triangle figure 2 illustrates these distances and the sight

casebycase basis table 12 shows the sight distance required at fourway intersections with minorstreet yield control table 13 shows the sight distance required at tintersections with one yieldcontrolled leg for the tintersection scenario table 13 the site distance on the minor street is measured eightytwo feet back from the traveled way of the minor street approach figure 3 and figure 4 illustrate these distances and the sight triangles for fourway and tintersections respectively sight distance values were only calculated for passenger cars as it is assumed that roads with significant truck traffic will not be yieldcontrolled intersections also it was assumed that the major streets do not have classifications higher than minor collector as these types of high classification streets should at least have stop control on the minor street table 12 intersection sight distance  fourway intersection with minor street yield control feet minor street major street

recommendations major street minor street arterial street major collector minor collector local street arterial street yes major collector yes yes minor collector yes yes yes local street yes yes yes yes commercial access 1 yes yes yes yes 2 residential access na no no no notes 1 for purposes of these recommendations commercial accesses also include multifamily developments 2 however if this affects the project or the local subdivision negatively then and appeals process can be initiated in addition to intersection lighting street lighting should also be provided especially when roads are curved or other design features make safely traveling the road at night more difficult without lighting the type and frequency of lighting should be based on the context of the street including adjacent land use architectural styles and pedestrian usage making general recommendations for street lighting is beyond the scope of an access management plan however for reference in commercial areas street lights should be installed at onehundredfiftyfoot intervals on opposite sides of the road and in residential areas at threehundredfoot intervals on opposite sides of the road street lights should be installed at corners with at least one on every block midblock street lighting is required if block lengths exceed five hundred feet street lights should be installed on opposite corner from stop signs unless otherwise determined by the city engineer figure 7 shows street lighting in a portion of the downtown core area that adds to the character of the street because of its aesthetics and pedestrian scale figure 7 street lighting such as this add to the character of the street and adds more to pedestrian safety than to traffic operations  582012 _____ level of service

management findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss 2 1989 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions to specific areas by provisions designed a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaking at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  g to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions 3 1989 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance includes methods and provisions for a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas 4 1989 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application a area of special flood hazard means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year b base flood means the flood having a one percent change of being equalled or exceeded in any given year c development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate including but not limited to buildings or other structures mining dredging filling grading paving excavation or drilling operations located within the area of special flood hazard d flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from 1 the overflow of inland or tidal waters andor 2 the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source e flood insurance range map firm means an official map of a community on which the federal emergency management agency has delineated areas of special flood hazard designated as zone a f lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area including basement an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a buildings lowest floor provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this ordinance g manufactured home means a structure transportable in one or more sections which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities for floodplain management purposes the term manufactured home also includes park trailers travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty days for insurance purposes the term manufactured home does not include park trailers travel trailers and other similar vehicles h structure means a walled and roofed building or manufactured home that is principally above ground i substantial improvement means any repair reconstruction or improvement of a structure the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either 1 before the improvement or repair is started or 2 if the structure has been damaged and is being restored before the damage occurred for the purpose of this definition substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall ceiling floor or other structural part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structures the term does not however include either 1 any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or 2 any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of historic places or a state inventory of historic places  1989 applicability this chapter shall apply to all areas of

general requirements 1 intent the standards outlined in this section are intended to 1 create complete streets that address all modes of travel including pedestrian traffic bicycle traffic transit and vehicular traffic 2 address all features of the street rightofway including sidewalks parkways traffic lanes bicycle lanes and medians 3 continue the existing logical and comprehensible system of streets and street names that result in a simple consistent and understandable pattern of blocks lots and house numbers 4 provide adequate access to all lots for vehicles and pedestrians 5 create streets that are appropriate for their contexts in residential commercial or mixed use districts and are designed to encourage travel at appropriate volumes and speeds 6 create streets and public rightsofway that result in stormwater runoff quantity reduction and improved quality of stormwater runoff 2 applicability the standards in this section apply to all vehicular rightsofway within the american fork station area 3 general requirements all proposed streets landscape or furnishings zones and sidewalks shall be located in dedicated vehicular rightsofway as required by this article 1

specifications defined by the public works department 22  general street type standards 1 street types street types defined in this section outline acceptable street configurations new streets should be designed using the principles and characteristics defined by each street type the city engineer may require additional rightofway pavement width or additional street elements depending on unique site characteristics 2 graphics the graphics provided here illustrating each street type are samples of recommendations and illustrate a possible configuration of that street type by applying the standards outlined and working with the city engineer other configurations are possible 3 typical street elements typical elements of a vehicular rightofway are divided into the vehicular and pedestrian realm each street type detailed in this article outlines which facilities are applicable refer to figure 22 1 typical rightofway elements 1 vehicular realm the vehicular realm is comprised of the travel lanes bicycle lanes and parking lanes 2 pedestrian realm the pedestrian realm is typically comprised of pedestrian facilities such as sidewalk pathtrail or offstreet bicycle path and a buffer area consisting of a landscape zone or furnishings zone that serves to buffer pedestrians or bicyclists from the movements of higher speed vehicles in the vehicular realm a landscape zone a landscape area between the back of curb or edge of pavement to the sidewalk in which street trees swales lighting and signage may be located typically used adjacent to residential buildings b furnishings zone a hardscape area that extends from the sidewalk to the back of curb in which street trees street furniture lighting and signage may be located typically used adjacent to commercial or office buildings 4 vehicular travel lanes the number and width of vehicular travel lanes are determined by the street type 5 vehicular onstreet parking onstreet parking as permitted on designated street types shall meet the following requirements 1 parallel parking is permitted on designated street types figure 22 1 typical rightofway elements 2 vehicular parking space dimensions the vehicular
