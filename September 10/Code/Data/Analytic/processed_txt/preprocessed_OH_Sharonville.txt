codified ordinances of sharonville ohio  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets and public services eleven planning and zoning thirteen building fifteen fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance included in the codified ordinances it indicates whether a given ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections cross

the offense  bwhen the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of culpability and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for the conduct described in the section then culpability is not required for a person to be guilty of the offense the fact that one subsection of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of

urbanization over the past decade has produced a need for an economical family unit that is adaptable to urban densities but that retains many of the suburban home amenities among the housing concepts emerging to meet this need are townhouses apartments and similar types of housing units with common property areas  cluster types of single family subdivisions in which housing units are arranged in cluster forms with clusters separated from each other by common open space  and housing units developed with related recreational space such as golf courses swimming pools private parks community

summary explanation of the project and a description of the nonconforming items g all site plan applications shall comply with the requirements of site plan review and architectural review board passed 92617 114708 ground and pole sign amortization a context and intent the city after a comprehensive study has adopted a master plan for the revitalization of the chester road corridor aka sharonville northern lights district including recommendations for a coordinated design of signage on private property the sharonville northern lights design standards and guidelines include design requirements for new freestanding signs that are consistent with master plan recommendations the effect of these requirements is to ensure that freestanding signs created or erected after the adoption of the northern lights overlay district regulations will be consistent with the citys stated purposes of encouraging the effective use of freestanding signs as a means of communication in sharonville northern lights  maintaining a sustainable and pleasing environment which attracts to sharonville northern lights major events of regional national and international interest  preserving a community that is attractive to business  improving pedestrian and traffic safety  minimizing the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property  and implementing relevant provisions of the sharonville northern lights master plan as updated periodically however there remain in northern lights a moderate number of ground and pole signs that violate the letter and purpose of the new regulations but that were lawfully erected under regulations applicable to signs prior to the adoption of this such signs are protected as pre existing nonconforming signs under although such protection is both fair and rational for the period of time necessary for the signs owners to recover reasonable investments in the signs it is the intent of the city that these signs should at some point be improved the purpose of this section is to provide for the eventual improvement of such nonconforming ground and pole signs after allowing their owners a reasonable period of use during which to recover their reasonable investment in such signs within eighteen 18 months of amendment of this section of the northern lights district zoning regulations property owners with preexisting ground and pole signs shall present a sign improvement plan to the planning commission for review and approval of existing ground and pole signs the planning commission may approve approve with conditions or deny any sign improvement plan b applicability the requirements of apply only to existing ground and pole signs that are located in yards that are adjacent to chester road within the northern lights overlay district c findings in support of the purposes of this as a basis for its adoption the city council hereby finds that 1 certain ground and pole signs erected lawfully in sharonville northern lights under previous sign regulations are inconsistent with both the letter and purpose of new freestanding sign regulations adopted by the city  2 the existence of such signs will in part hinder the purposes of the city in adopting this which was based on careful study and community discussion  3 the city recognizes the need to allow an individual to recover a lawful investment such as the erection or placement of a sign but the city also recognizes that the period of time necessary to recover such an investment is finite  4 the internal revenue regulations adopted thereunder allow businesses to depreciate the full cost of a sign over a period of five years or less  5 most signs are financed or leased for a period of five years or less  6 many signs are routinely replaced after a period of five years  7 many general advertising signs are erected on property leased for a period of five years which may be renewable for an additional period of five years  8 there are thus many indications in the market that a reasonable sign user anticipates recovery of the investment in a sign over approximately five years  9 therefore the requirement that a sign be removed after a specified period that is more than five years long will in most cases permit an owner to recover the full investment in the sign  10 this concept is commonly called the amortization of an investment

of this chapter whether by removal of the sign or modification of the sign if the sign is not so removed or modified the owner shall be subject to a separate penalty under for each day for which the sign continues to exist in violation of the requirements of this chapter f appeal 1 the owner of a ground or pole sign affected by this chapter may at any time after the effective date of this chapter and before the expiration of thirty 30 days after the date of notice under d file a hardship appeal with the board of zoning appeals 2 the board of zoning appeals shall consider said appeal at its next regular meeting if and only if the board of zoning appeals finds that the sign owner will not be able to recover reasonable investment in the sign by the date established by c the board of zoning appeals may extend that date by a reasonable period which shall not be longer than is necessary to allow the owner to recover the reasonable investment in the sign and shall in no event extend such date more than an additional five years 3 in making its determination the board of zoning appeals shall consider only the reasonable investment of the owner in the sign prior to the effective date of this chapter  no considerations of alleged market value shall be considered nor shall investments made after the effective date of this chapter 4 the sign owner shall have the burden of proof in such a matter and shall be obligated to provide to the zoning board of appeals original or certified copies of all invoices for work or materials related to the sign and certified copies of applicable land leases equipment leases andor security agreements related to the sign any appeal of the determination of the zoning board of appeals shall be to the district court 5 for purposes of this section a sign owner shall be deemed to have recovered the investment in the sign when a for a leased sign the total lease revenues equal the cost of the sign plus actual necessary maintenance expense plus a net return on investment equal to three percentage 3% points above the cost of funds borrowed for the sign or if the cost of such funds cannot be determined or if no funds were borrowed fifteen
