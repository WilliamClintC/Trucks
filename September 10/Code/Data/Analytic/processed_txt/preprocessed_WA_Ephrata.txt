such cases the planning commission may modify those requirements so that not more than ephrata municipal zoning fifteen percent of the site must be landscaped  provided that the landscaping and corresponding setbacks required are those most beneficial to the public more intensive landscaping may be required if the reduction in area would reduce the effectiveness of landscaping to a point where the intent of the landscaping type cannot be satisfied 2 the inclusion of significant existing vegetation located on the site would result in as good as or better satisfaction of the purposes of this chapter 3 threefoot berms or sixfoot architectural barriers are incorporated into the landscape design adjacent to the berm or barrier the width of the perimeter landscaping strip may be reduced up to twentyfive percent if the landscaping materials are incorporated elsewhere on site 4 existing conditions on or adjacent to the site such as significant topographic differences vegetation structures or utilities would render application of this chapter ineffective 5 an existing or proposed structure precludes installation of the total amount of required perimeter landscaping in such cases the landscaping material shall be incorporated on another portion of the site 6 the proposed landscaping represents a superior result or is more effective than that which would be achieved by

during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall only be issued upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause ephrata municipal zoning fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subparagraph  or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare 7 variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of flood proofing than watertight or dryflood proofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subparagraph 5a and otherwise complies with the general standards in a 8 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced
