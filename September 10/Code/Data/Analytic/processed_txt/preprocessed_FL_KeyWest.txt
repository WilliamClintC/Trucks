to the systems existence  to base operations  and to costs of collection system restoration this component of rates and charges shall be determined annually and shall be set by resolution of the city commission 1 debt service subcomponent the debt service subcomponent shall be a charge determined as a base charge unit pro rata share of the required payments for the currently outstanding debt service of the sewer system except for adjustments in this subcomponent made for the united states navy which satisfied part of its capital contribution requirements by a lump sum payment of a connection charge 2 base administration operations maintenance and replacement subcomponent the base administration operations maintenance and replacement subcomponent shall be a charge determined as a base charge unit pro rata share of the referenced costs determined by the city manager as being attributable to the systems existence and to the systems basic operations and related activities and requirements that are not attributable to system requirements imposed by the waste contributions of system users 3 collection system restoration subcomponent the collection system restoration subcomponent shall be a charge determined as a base charge unit pro rata share of the annually budgeted investment designated for use in the planned 20year collection system restoration program c proportional use component the proportional use component of rates and charges for sewer services assessable to a user of the city sewer systems a customer account shall be determined as the sum of the pro rata allocations to the users monthly units of waste contributions to the system each 1000 gallons of actualestimated wastes per month of costs of the system incurred for and allocable to administration operations maintenance and replacement attributable to the system receiving treating and disposing of users contributions of wastes of normal or domestic strength this component of rates and charges shall be determined annually and shall be set by resolution of the city commission d extranormal strength component the extranormal strength component of rates and charges for sewer

in excess of 350 milligrams per liter of biochemical oxygen demand bod and in excess of 350 milligrams per liter of total suspended solids tss the extranormal strength component shall be determined by generally accepted cost accounting principles and shall be expressed as the costs of treating and disposing of a pound of bod and a pound of tss the component shall be applied as a surcharge for wastes contributed to the system having in excess of 350 milligrams per liter of bod and in excess of 350 milligrams per liter of tss the extranormal strength component shall be calculated by the city

use component of the user charge for such residential wells andor cisterns shall be based on an amount of water equal to the average monthly flow for residential system users in addition to the proportional use component a flat monthly well surcharge shall be assessed for each residential living space served by the unmetered wells andor cisterns the well surcharge shall be assessed to account for the exposure of the wastewater system to unmetered flows and the likelihood that wells are contributing more than the average monthly flow for residential system users for any residential system user having a metered water connection to the fkaa water system and owning wells andor cisterns currently in use and connected to the wastewater system a base charge shall be assessed for the fkaa water system connection but no base charge shall be assessed for the wells andor cisterns however a minimum flow charge based on the estimated average monthly residential wastewater flow shall be assessed if the fkaa meter reading is less than the average in addition regardless of the amount of metered fkaa water consumption the flat monthly well surcharge to be established by the city manager shall be assessed for each residential living space served by an unmetered well or cistern connected to the citys wastewater system owners of singlefamily residences and duplexes including mobile homes may but shall not be required to install water meters on their private water supplies wells and cisterns used by all nonresidential users and that are connected to the citys wastewater system

shall be applicable for 12 billing periods or until an adjustment is made resulting from a users request for adjustment in accordance with the appeals and adjustment sections of this subdivision c base charge units for purposes of determining the number of base charge units chargeable to each sewer system user the average monthly water consumption shall be calculated annually for residential users on the basis of a threeyear rolling average the average monthly water consumption per residential dwelling unit shall be calculated from fkaa water billing records from city sewer department data files and from the citys water well and cistern meter readings data for all residential users of the sewer system owning such wells and cisterns currently in use who have elected to install at their own expense water meters the water consumption records and meter reading data shall be adjusted prior to calculation of the monthly average residential consumptions to account for nonuse meter errors customers misclassifications and other data errors each residential dwelling unit shall be defined as one base charge unit regardless of the source of water for that dwelling unit the total annual water consumption from fkaa and city meter reading data adjusted for each nonresidential user of the sewer system shall be divided by the number of water bills rendered to such fkaa water customer and the quotient of that division shall be divided by the monthly average water consumption for residential users of the sewer system calculated as prescribed in this section the quotient of the second division will show the number of base charge units and fractions thereof that such sewer system user shall be assessed  provided however that the number of the base charge units shall not be less than one the resulting number of base charge units including fractions thereof shall be billed to such nonresidential users for the 12 billing periods following such determination 42b

generally crown reduction pruning of trees shall consist of the reduction of tops sides or individual limbs the terms cutting back and drop crotch pruning are sometimes used interchangeably with the term crown reduction pruning by contrast the term topping is used to refer to a generally unacceptable arboricultural practice the correct technique for crown reduction involves removal of a parent limb or dominant leader at the point of attachment of a lateral branch see diagram c this practice is to be undertaken only for the following reasons 1 in situations where branches interfere with utility lines  2 when there has been significant crown dieback  3 when it is necessary to achieve specific topiary training or dwarfing  and 4 when due to storm damage or prior incorrect pruning it is appropriate to prune for safety and aesthetic reasons 314a5 731997 class iv crown reducing pruning the following the specifications are for class iv crown reducing pruning 1 all branches too large to

removing a parent leader or limb to a lateral branch the final cut should be made as close to parallel as possible with the branch bark ridge and the lateral limb the cut should be made as close to the bark ridge as possible without cutting into it care should be taken to avoid damaging the lateral limb when the final cut is made 8 remove the weaker or less desirable of crossed or rubbing branches such removal should not leave large open spaces in the general outline of the tree 9 generally in crown reduction pruning not more than onethird of the total area should be reduced at a single operation every effort should be made to cut back to a lateral at least onethird to onehalf the diameter of the parent limb or leader that is being removed cuts not made to a suitable lateral sometimes called topping cuts shall not be permitted 10 before a branch is cut back the ratio of live wood in the branch to leaf surface area in the branch should be considered carefully the leaves must supply sufficient carbohydrates food to maintain the wood in the branch as well as send excess carbohydrates to the trunk and roots for storage and later use generally not more than onethird the total leaf surface area should be removed at any one time 11 trees should be pruned to a shape typical of their species 12 to prevent sunburn on thinbarked trees just enough limbs shall be removed to get the desired effect without admitting too much sunlight to the trunk of the tree or the top of large branches the damage may be minimized by doing work on susceptible species during the dormant season 13 when removing the lower branches of trees for crown elevation or underclearance care should be taken to maintain a symmetrical appearance and cuts should not be made so large or so numerous that they will prevent normal sap flow 14 periodic crown reduction for certain species such as silver maple the true poplars and other trees with brittle and soft wood is an established arboricultural practice this procedure has proven beneficial in maintaining safety over long periods of time in all cases it is preferable to make cuts when branches are small so as to avoid developing stem decay and to begin training these trees when they are young and prune them regularly thereafter so as to avoid removing an excessive amount of leaf surface in one operation 314a5 731997 palms a palm pruning

such conflict transient living accommodations in residential dwellings  regulations a intent these regulations apply only to the transient use of residential dwellings in 198 the city enacted former zoning code section 352444 which provided the following definition of a transient living accommodation commercially operated housing principally available to shortterm visitors for less than twentyeight 28 days this definition shall hereinafter be referred to as the former transient definition some property owners and developers interpreted the former transient definition to mean that an owner could rent his or her residential dwelling for less than half the year without the dwelling losing its residential status and therefore without the need for a cityissued transient license so long as state licensing requirements were met this interpretation went unchallenged by the city three categories of transient use of residential dwellings resulted 1 some owners obtained a transient license allowing unrestricted transient use  2 some owners followed the former transient definition and accordingly rented their properties less than half the year  and 3 some owners put their residences to a transient use without city or state license and without regard to existing regulations in addition many residential dwelling owners never put their properties to a transient use and they no longer have the opportunity to do so under the citys current rate of growth ordinance the city commission finds that shortterm or transient rentals affect the character and stability of a residential neighborhood the home and its intrinsic influences are the foundation of good citizenship  although shortterm tenants no doubt are good citizens generally they do not ordinarily contribute to activities that strengthen a community therefore the city intends by these regulations to establish a uniform definition of transient living accommodations and to halt the use of residences for transient purposes in order to preserve the residential character of neighborhoods the city has provided only a brief phaseout period in recognition that in many instances investment expectations have already been met either income or rising market value finally certain guest houses currently hold a number of the citys category 10c business tax receipt which denotes transient use of a residential
