will foster the consistent statewide application of postconstruction performance standards for new development and redevelopment contained in wis adm ch nr 151 subchapters iii and iv  3302009 authority a this article is adopted by the common council under the authority granted by wis stats   this article supersedes all provisions of an ordinance previously enacted under wis stats  6223 that relate to stormwater management regulations except as otherwise specified in wis stats   wis stats  6223 applies to this article and to any amendments to this article b the provisions of this article are deemed not to limit any other lawful regulatory powers of the same governing body c the common council hereby designates the zoning administrator director of public works or their designee to administer and enforce the provisions of this article d the requirements of this article do not preempt more stringent stormwater management requirements that may be imposed by any of the following 1 wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under wis stats  28116 and 28333 2 targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under wis adm nr   3302009 findings of fact a the common council finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  3302009 purpose and intent a purpose the general purpose of this article is to establish longterm post construction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property b intent it is the intent of the common council that this article regulates postconstruction stormwater discharges to waters of the state this article may be applied on a sitebysite basis the common council recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this article is preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds on a municipal and regional scale such plans may prescribe regional stormwater devices practices or systems any of which may be designed to treat runoff from more than one site prior to discharge to waters of the state where such plans are in conformance with the performance standards developed under wis stats  28116 for regional stormwater management measures and have been approved by the common council it is the intent of this article that the approved plan be used to identify postconstruction management measures acceptable for the community  3302009 applicability and jurisdiction a applicability 1 where not otherwise limited by law this article
