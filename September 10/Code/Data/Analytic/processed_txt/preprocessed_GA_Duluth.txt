that are incorporated herein by reference include the following stormwater management program assessment and cost analysis technical memorandum no 1 dated   stormwater utility user fee recommendations memorandum project memorandum dated   and stormwater utility implementation technical memorandum addendum dated  or the most recent version 9 given the stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater management services systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs 10 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city of duluth is consistent with the present and future needs of the community 11 the stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs and risk exposure it is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the citys stormwater management program which results in services being provided to such properties and the owners thereof the fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the user fee charge should correlate to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the citys stormwater management program 12 the stormwater management needs in the city include but are not limited to protection of the public health safety and welfare of the community provision of stormwater management services renders andor results in both a service and a benefit to all properties property owners businesses citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways even though the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable 13 a stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management service delivery within the city user fee charges user fees and other mechanisms 14 the amount of impervious surface on each improved property is the most important factor influencing stormwater runoff characteristics and these characteristics bear a rational nexus to the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future to that property as a result the amount of impervious surface on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge 15 a schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure while at the same time minimizing the citys customer account management and maintenance efforts 16 stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs including but not limited to special service fees special assessments revenue bonds use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes splost and other forms of revenue as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council 17 the existence of privately owned and maintained onsite stormwater control facilities activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the citys stormwater management program and the stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems facilities activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property 18 it is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services systems or facilities together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services systems or facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city of duluth stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes 19 in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the public the governing authority of the city of duluth hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund the city will enact a stormwater utility rate ordinance in the future to establish stormwater utility user fee charge rates for the provision of stormwater management services  definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a

subdivisions and planned developments this development details 20702 chart of uses this by the following matrix chart table 2c principal uses allowed by zoning district the uses allowed by right and by special use approval in each zoning district a listed allowed use is one that is allowed in the zone without any qualifications except wherever such qualifications may be indicated in this development listed special use is one that may be granted only when certain conditions are met in the following chart an a means that the use is automatically allowed in the zoning district listed by the abbreviation at the top of the column an s means that the use is allowed only by special use approval a blank space indicates that the use is not allowed under any circumstances 20703 allowed principal accessory and temporary uses a a principal use is the specific primary purpose for which land or a building is used b an accessory use is a use that is permitted on a property in conjunction with a principal use an accessory use is incidental to the principal use and would not exist independent of the principal use c a temporary use is a use having a specific duration or the end of which is related to a specific action usually lasting for only a few days or months at a time d principal uses that are allowed by right or allowed only by special use approval in each zoning district are shown on the following table 2c accessory uses and temporary uses that are allowed in conjunction with a principal use are shown on table 2d 20704 special uses principal and accessory uses that are

zoning district whether by right or with approval as a special use is specifically prohibited 20707 interpretation of uses some degree of interpretation will occasionally be required it is not possible to list each and every variation or name of a given use a in addition to other generally accepted references and resources the north american industrial classification system naics published by the us department of commerce 2012 edition may be referred to in order to interpret the definition of uses listed on table 2c and table 2d and to identify similar uses that may be allowed along with each listed use the naics classification number is shown on the tables for each applicable use for reference and interpretation only  the naics is not adopted as part of this b the naics assigns classification numbers to businesses and industries based on the primary business activity in which the company is engaged while business activity usually corresponds to land use type and therefore can be easily assigned to appropriate zoning districts there are exceptions some businesses may be primarily engaged in a certain industrysuch as telecommunications for instance like at&tbut individual locations host notably different activities for a company like at&t for instance different facilities may include retail stores for telephones offices for administrative functions satellite and exchange switching stations and repair and installation staging lots where heavy equipment vehicles telephone poles wire spools and materials are stored as a result interpretation is occasionally needed for an individual use regardless of the business activity in which the parent company is engaged 1 if no naics classification number is shown on the table there is no corresponding category to the land use listed the use may be residential in nature there are no naics categories for residences or may be a land use activity not generally recognized as a business activity or industry type 2 in all cases of uncertainty the determination of whether or not a particular use is allowed in a particular zoning district shall reflect the purpose of the zoning district as stated in this both the common and dictionary definitions of the use and the array of listed uses that are allowed in the district as to their character and intensity table 2c and table 2d are organized under the following

density of 20 units per acre the term unit is an expression of basal area a standard forest inventory measurement and is not synonymous with tree a single tree equal to one tree unit is between 13 and 14 inches in diameter this density requirement must be met whether or not the site had trees prior to development the density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved planting new trees or some combination of the two as represented by the formula below sdf   edf + rdf sdf site density factor the minimum tree density requirement to be maintained on a developed site expressed in units per acre edf existing density factor the total number of tree density units measured or calculated based on trees that will remain as conserved on site rdf replacement density factor density or total unit value of new trees to be planted on a site the sdf is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by units per acre required example a 22 acre site has a sdf of 22 x 20 units per acre   44 units the edf is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor units using table 7b an example of determining the edf by identifying the trees inventoried in a tree save area is shown below trees found dbh quantity unit value total 5  8 pines 21 x 03   63 9  12 oaks 14 x 06   84 13  16 oaks 10 x 12   12 17  20 poplars 5 x 19   95 21  24 oaks 3 x 28   84 total 446 density units edf see table 7b calculating tree density city of duluth udc 724 therefore with a sdf requirement of 44 units a tree save area totaling 446 density units satisfies the site

trees do not exist onsite to meet the tree density requirements replacement trees will be needed calculate the rdf by subtracting the edf from the sdf for instance if it was determined that the 22
