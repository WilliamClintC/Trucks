up a neighborhood appears b standard the total building coverage standard for the mu zone is stated in table 2c2b of this section the maximum building coverage standard establishes the percentage of the total area of a lot that can be covered by buildings the total building area of all buildings on the property including both principal and accessory buildings is used to calculate the building coverage 2 front setback coverage a purpose the front setback coverage standard ensures that a certain portion of the front setback remains free of impervious surface which helps to maintain a consistent and pleasant environment along neighborhood streets these standards increase public safety by preventing excessive front yard paving and vehicular storage that may obscure the principal dwelling and the main entrance from view of the street in addition this standard helps to prevent neighborhood streets that are dominated by front yard pavement particularly along frontages with narrow residential lots b standard the maximum front setback coverage standard for the mixed use zone is stated in table 2c2b of this section the standard applies only to residential uses in the mu zone the table lists the maximum percentage of the required front setback that may be covered by impervious surface including driveways patios decks and other paved areas front setback coverage may not exceed the percentage indicated in table 2c 2b of this section c exception a special exception may be requested to increase the allowed front setback coverage the board of adjustment may adjust the front setback coverage standard if the owner or lawful occupant of a property demonstrates that the general special exception approval criteria and the following specific approval criteria have been satisfied 1 the lot is of an irregular shape or contains severe topography such that there is practical difficulty meeting the front setback coverage standard 2 the applicant has demonstrated that every effort has been made to design buildings paved areas and vehicular use areas to meet the front setback coverage standard such efforts include reducing the width of driveways reducing paved

nonconforming situations are created when the zoning designation is changed or the zoning regulations are changed such that an existing lawfully established use structure lot or development no longer complies with the zoning regulations the intent of these regulations is not to force all nonconforming situations to be immediately brought into conformance rather the intent is to guide future uses and development in a direction consistent with city policy to protect the character of an area by reducing the potential negative impacts from nonconforming situations and over time to bring development into compliance with the citys regulations  144e2 types of nonconforming situations a nonconforming use a nonconforming use is a use that when established was a permitted use was allowed as a provisional use or was approved as a special exception but which subsequently due to a change in the zone or to the requirements of the zoning is no longer allowed this definition includes residential uses that exceed the allowable residential density of a zone minimum lot area per unit requirements and uses that exceed the maximum floor area ratio or maximum floor area standards specified for a particular use or zone b nonconforming structure a nonconforming structure is a structure or portion of a structure that was established in conformance with the setback building height building width lot coverage standards or other requirements or standards of the zoning relate to the design of the building or structure but which subsequently due to a change in the zone or to the requirements of the zoning is no longer in conformance with one or more of these standards c nonconforming development nonconforming development is an element of a development such as a parking area a loading area outdoor lighting landscaping screening or signage that was established in conformance with the zoning but which subsequently due to a change in the zone or to the requirements of the zoning is no longer in conformance with the current applicable standards  sterling codifiers inc  444715 d nonconforming lot a nonconforming lot is a lot of record that was established in conformance

of these requirements  144e3 general provisions and restrictions a continuation of nonconforming situations legal nonconforming situations are allowed to continue in accordance with the provisions of this article b continuance of unlawful uses nothing in this article shall be interpreted as authorization for the continuance of the use of a structure or land established unlawfully in violation of the regulations in effect at the time that the use or structure was established c determination of nonconforming status the burden of establishing that a nonconforming situation is a legal nonconforming situation rests solely upon the owner of such nonconformity d repairs and maintenance incidental repairs and routine maintenance of a nonconforming use or nonconforming structure is permitted unless such repairs increase the extent of nonconformity or are otherwise expressly prohibited by provisions of this title nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition in accordance with an official order of a public official  144e4 nonconforming singlefamily uses except with regard to the

use is changed in order to increase the occupancy beyond that of a family or group household the property must be brought into full compliance with the number of required off street parking spaces c a nonconforming structure that contains a singlefamily use may be restored to the same degree of nonconformity or less if destroyed or damaged by fire explosion act of god or by a public enemy such a structure may also be repaired or structurally altered provided such construction does not increase or extend the degree of nonconformity and does not increase or extend any other nonconforming situation on the property d a nonconforming accessory structure to a singlefamily use may be restored to the same degree of nonconformity or less if destroyed or damaged by fire explosion act of god

separate vehicular use areas from pedestrians yet allow views to easily penetrate as for outdoor sales display lots and for general landscaping on commercial properties 2 requirements a grass lawn must be maintained within the landscaped area with groupings of low growing shrubs and ground plants approximately half the landscaping plants must be of an evergreen variety to provide texture and color throughout the year plantings should be arranged to achieve the desired buffering effect but there is no established minimum or maximum height 3 figure 5f1  general buffering s1 b variable height screen s2 1 intent the s2 standard is a buffering treatment that uses distance and low level screening to separate uses from the public right of way from other zones to define edges and separate vehicular use areas from pedestrians the standard is applied where moderate screening is necessary to soften the impact of uses or paved areas but where some visibility between areas is more desirable than a total visual screen 2 required materials the s2 standard requires enough shrubs to form a landscape screen ranging between two feet 2 and four feet 4 in height at least a third of the

additional subdivision lots the standards in this subsection are intended as minimum standards in areas where connectivity is limited by topography previous development patterns or other unusual features and shall not be used as a means of circumventing the street connectivity standards set forth in subsection a of this section the following guidelines will be used by the city in determining whether additional street access is a prerequisite to additional lots or developable parcels being approved by the city 1 additional access may be required if a proposed development will result in any portion of a street that provides a single means of access to an area being overburdened with traffic overburdened shall be defined as a projected volume which exceeds the midpoint design volume as follows a local street five hundred 500 vehicles per day b collector street two thousand five hundred 2500 vehicles per day 2 projected traffic volumes shall be determined by using the most recent average daily traffic count when available and adding it to projected traffic generation as determined by the city in the absence of a recent traffic count projected traffic volumes shall be calculated by using projected traffic generation for both existing and proposed development 3 additional means of access may also be required if any of the following conditions exist or will exist if additional lots or developable parcels are approved a there are physical features that may increase the probability of blockages along the single means of access to the development these physical features include but are not limited to slopes eight percent 8% or greater  floodplains as designated by the federal emergency management agency  a bridged or culverted roadway  trees adjacent to the roadway with trunk diameter greater than four inches 4  a grade separated highway  or a railroad b the existing access is insufficient to provide efficient safe andor cost effective routes for the provision of public and emergency services for the proposed development c the street which provides a single means of access to the area is a local or collector street along which there are existing or proposed facilities that may increase the probability of pedestrianmotor vehicle conflicts these facilities include but are not limited to schools daycare centers and parks d there are land uses located along the subject street that serve special populations which may increase the volume of emergency vehicle trips these uses include but are not limited to adult daycares facilities serving elderly persons or persons with disabilities 4 for a situation requiring additional means of access based on the above criteria a single means of access may be permitted as a temporary condition a temporary condition is one in which there is secured written assurance from the private subdivider that the road which will provide the necessary access will be constructed within three 3 years of development or alternatively said access is scheduled for construction no later than the third year of the then current capital improvements program of the city c street types table 151 standards for street rights of way of this section provides a summary of various street types the information in this table is intended to provide guidance for the design of the street network within a subdivision when designing a subdivision street types should be chosen based on the intended function of the street and anticipated level of traffic the city will review the proposed streets and determine the appropriate street type based on the factors set forth in this section d dedication of right of way land shall be dedicated to the city for all public street rights of way within the development and

entering the home 2 do not sandblast or waterblast lead based paint on the outside of your home you do not want the paint chips to end up all over your yard or the neighbors yard sandblasting and waterblasting is safe only if you have a special machine that will catch the paint chips 3 remove furniture drapes and if possible carpet from the room you will work in before starting work cover the floor and furniture that cannot be removed from the room with a sheet of six 6 mil plastic seal each room from the rest of the house with plastic while working in it be careful not to track dust and paint chips into other areas of the home 4 wear a negative pressure half mask respirator with a magenta purple hepa filtration canister you can buy these respirators at auto parts stores used for brake and clutch work the respirator will say hepa filters  asbestos approved be sure to read the instructions for positive and negative face fit tests and for cleaning the respirator if the respirator does not fit properly it will not protect you it will also not protect you if it is dirty these masks do not protect against organic vapors from heat guns or paint strippers so use heat guns and paint strippers only where there is good ventilation this will help disperse any organic vapors from the strippers or from heating the paint 5 replace the filters on the respirator if they are damaged you should also replace them if it gets hard to breathe this means that the filters are plugging wash the face piece without the filters with mild soap store the respirator in a bag outside of the work area 6 if you have asthma emphysema or heart problems do not try to wear a respirator take off the respirator immediately if you feel short of breath if you have a perforated eardrum that has not been repaired this respirator will not protect you from inhaling lead dust 7 if you will be using a heat gun make sure it is a low temperature heat gun that operates below one thousand one hundred degrees fahrenheit 1100f 8 do not eat drink or smoke until you have left the work area and thoroughly washed your hands and face take a shower wash your hair and change clothes before coming in contact with others 9 keep pregnant women and children out of the room if you are working on a small project a small project would be working on only a few surfaces in one room at a time for larger projects keep pregnant women and children out of the home until you complete the job 10 after you complete the job wash all surfaces thoroughly with any household detergent vacuum with a hepa vacuum or a regular vacuum with microfilter bags shampoo carpets using a machine that pumps liquid into the carpet and pulls it back out 11 place paint chips dust and pieces of wood in a plastic bag at the end of each day put this with your garbage that will go to the landfill after you complete work to eliminate lead based paint hazards you must maintain the remaining lead based paint in good condition you should also frequently clean the house wash floors window sills areas between the windows and other places where dust and dirt accumulate at least once a week check the condition of lead based paint frequently you need to repair paint when it begins to deteriorate  17524 fees the department of housing and inspection services is authorized to assess permit and
