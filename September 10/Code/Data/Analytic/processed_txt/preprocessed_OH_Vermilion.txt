eight  business regulation and taxation ten  streets and public services twelve  planning and zoning fourteen building sixteen  fire prevention editors note the numbering system used in these codified ordinances is similar to that used in the ohio revised is consistent with general practice each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal the section number appears to the right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01 with this numbering system the codified ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly codes titles and chapters are initially evennumbered thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as in the revised are the traffic and general offenses codes where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter in each are included as part of the sections newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66006 and precede 66007 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code subsections without histories or with the words adopting  at

program ppghp for all city properties and operations has been prepared for the city of vermilion storm water management program swmp bthe swmp is approved for coverage under the current edition of the ohio epa npdes permit for small municipal separate storm sewer system cthe program described in this document has been developed with the intent to reduce the discharge of pollutants from municipal operations for all city properties and operations it is the intent of this program to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the site to the maximum extent practicable to protect water quality and to satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of ohio revised as described in the ohio epa permits specifically this document addresses pollution prevention and good housekeeping for municipal operations as described in control measure 6 of the ohio epa permits the city of vermilion is committed to implement pollution prevention and good housekeeping best management practices bmps to reduce or prevent the discharge of pollutants in storm water runoff from municipal operations and facilities within their municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 dthis ppghp is the main focus of the program bmps for control measure 6 in the swmp this document has been prepared following observations and inspections of the site and municipal operations during the inspections the existing storm water control measures already in place were documented and existing and potential impacts to storm water runoff were noted components of other plans already in place at the facilities such as spill response and prevention plans were incorporated into this ppghp or expanded upon as necessary this ppghp presents storm water controls that will then be used by the city of vermilion to perform regular employee training and to implement and evaluate bmps and controls at the facility to fulfill the requirements of the ohio epa permits ethe following section of the document describes the municipal site or operations that are the focus of the storm water bmps the remaining sections of the document contain a description of the bmps that are recommended to control storm water pollution from specific municipal activities at the site each section contains bmps tailored to control storm water impacts for each particular type of municipal activity or operation the recommended bmps will be implemented on an ongoing basis for the indefinite future the city of vermilion plans to implement these bmps or similar controls wherever they would be effective at preventing pollutants from discharging with storm water from the site passed 8111 108402 description of municipal facility and operations athis program is developed for implementation at all city properties the director of public service shall be the primary site contact the secondary site contact shall be the department head of that facility bactivities at this site include but not limited to 1vehicle storage and limited fleet maintenance 2storage of aggregate and road repair materials 3storage of winter deicing materials 4vehicle impound lot 5temporary storage of organic materials passed 8111 108403 description of proposed bmps asuccessful storm water pollution control relies in large part of proper training and education of employees many of the recommended bmps in this ppghp will require specific training for employees who conduct the activities it is essential that employees understand and implement the bmps that apply to operations within each facility training can be completed separately or done in conjunction with regular employee training procedures bemployee training will emphasize the importance of keeping pollutants out of the storm drains because the drains go directly to the surface waters of the state without benefit of wastewater treatment that the sanitary sewers receive facility personnel will be educated about the harmful environmental effects of improper disposal of materials into the storm drain so that they understand the importance of preventing storm water pollution cthe following training will be implemented by the city of vermilion 1experienced workers or other trained personnel will be used to train facility employees 2training will be completed and documented once per year for all appropriate personnel 3new personnel will be required to review and understand this document prior to initiating work activities passed 8111 108404 eliminating illicit and nonstorm water discharges a the ohio epa permits prohibit discharges of anything but storm water to the storm drains city of vermilion personnel will inspect the facility to be sure no unauthorized discharges enter storm drains or discharge offsite connections that allow sanitary or any sort of wastewater to enter the storm drain are prohibited including storm drain connections from indoor drains or sinks these are known as illicit connections and must be eliminated banother form of prohibited discharge is illegal dumping pollutants may be introduced to storm drains inadvertently by routine practices that discharge water outdoors or they may be released intentionally by routinely discharging wastes wash water and other materials to storm drains catch basins and other conveyance facilities either on the facility or in the street a large part of this improper discharge results from employees lack of understanding coupled with a lack of readily available proper routes for the discharge continuing employee training will be needed as described in cthe city of vermilion will make a longterm ongoing effort to assure that no illegal discharges will occur from municipal operations at the facility this requires continuing observations to identify potential sources of intentional or inadvertent illicit discharges efforts will be made to discontinue or reroute the storm water from those activities dthe following measures to help prevent nonstorm water discharges will be implemented 1provide wellmarked proper disposal or collection methods for solid or liquid waste 2train employees in proper disposal of nonstorm water employees will be educated to understand that storm drains connect directly to streams and other water bodies without treatment 3label all storm drain inlets and catch basins no dumpingflows to streams so employees can tell which inlets are part of the storm drain system 4periodically inspect and maintain the facility operations and bmps to evaluate the success of efforts to reduce and eliminate nonstorm water discharges 5periodically inspect and maintain storm drain inlets clean out catch basins so that accumulated pollutants do not wash down the storm drains passed 8111 108405 spill prevention control and cleanup a even small spills can have cumulative effects that add up to a significant source of potential pollutants in storm water discharges from the site the goal is to prevent spills and leaks maintain a regular inspection and repair schedule and correct potential spill situations before a spill can occur bwhen a spill does occur quick and effective response will prevent pollutants from reaching storm water spills will be cleaned up promptly and not allowed to evaporate so that pollutants do not remain on the pavement to be washed to the storm drains with the next rain or remain in the soil to become a possible groundwater pollutant if the spill is on an unpaved surface personnel will determine whether the contaminated soil should be removed to prevent it from being a source of future storm water pollutants spill procedures will also include cleaning up leaks drips and other spills without water whenever possible cspill prevention and response procedures for hazardous materials stored or handled onsite will follow the procedures described in the facility hazardous materials management plan properly trained personnel will contain and collect the spilled substance then dispose of the substances and any contaminated soil in compliance with local hazardous materials regulations dthe spill control and cleanup procedures for this facility are as follows 1small spills these are spills that can be wiped up with a shop rag wet rags will not be put in the dumpster with the shop trash  they will be stored in a covered bin like the kind used at auto service stations used rags will be sent to a professional cleaning service or disposed of with the hazardous wastes if necessary 2mediumsized spills these are spills too large to wipe up with a rag medium sized spills will be contained and soaked up using dry absorbent material such as vermiculite speciallyprepared sawdust or kitty litter absorbent snakes may be used as temporary booms to contain and soak up the liquid used absorbent material will be swept up or collected and will be disposed of with the shop trash if nonhazardous or with the hazardous wastes if necessary a wetdry shop vacuum cleaner may also be used to collect spills and dispose of the liquid with hazardous wastes vacuums will not be used for gasoline solvents or other volatile fluids because the enclosed vacuum may become an explosive hazard 3large spills spills of nonhazardous liquids will be contained and cleaned using a minimum amount of wash water storm drain inlets or sewer inlets will be plugged to prevent the spill enter from entering the ms4 temporary plugs will be kept onsite for the facility inlets and employees will be trained in when and how to use them for hazardous materials spills the procedures described in the hazardous materials management plan will be implemented ea spillrelease incident reporting form is provided in appendix a this form should be filled out promptly after a spill or release passed 8111 108406 outdoor equipment operations a the director of public service or street department assistant foreman will identify all equipment at the facility that may be exposed to storm water or that may discharge potential pollutants that may be exposed to storm water ban employee will be assigned to inspect each piece of equipment on a regular basis to see that it is functioning properly leaks malfunctions staining on and around the equipment and other evidence of leaks and discharges will be observed and noted the inspecting person will be responsible for reporting any spills or leaks using the form provided in appendix a spill and leak control and cleanup activities are described in cthe equipment operations bmps for this facility are as follows 1equipment will be placed on an impermeable surface or a drip pan will be installed beneath the potential leak points of the equipment 2the amount of rainwater that contacts the equipment will be minimized wherever possible passed 8111 108407 outdoor materials storage and handling a outdoor material storage areas will be inspected for possible exposure of pollutants to storm water runoff bulk solid materials raw materials and construction materials or supplies stored outdoors will be covered and protected from storm water if pollutants could enter storm water materials of concern on the facility include gravel sand lumber topsoil compost concrete metal products and others bthe bmps for the outdoor materials storage and handling areas for this facility are as follows 1material is stored in one of three ways aon a paved surface with a roof or covering so that no direct rainfall contacts them and with appropriate berms or runoff controls to prevent runon of storm water bon a specially constructed paved area with a drainage system with a slope to minimize water pooling prevent runoff and runon with berms or curbing along the perimeter drainage is directed to treatment facilities or water quality catch basins along the lower edge of the pad ccovered with plastic sheeting secured with weights such as fires or sand bags if possible a mounded or bermed area that will prevent runon of storm water material will be used 2the parking lot or other surfaces near bulk materials storage facilities will be swept periodically to remove fines that may wash out of the materials liquid tanks will be kept in a designated area on a paved impermeable surface and within a berm or other secondary containment 3hazardous materials will be stored as described in the hazardous materials management plan and in a manner that ensures storm water protection 4outdoor storage containers will be kept in good condition containers will be inspected regularly for damage or leaks 5a portable pumping system will be used that can be moved to accommodate separate containment structures on the facility water can then be pumped into a truck or portable temporary holding tank the water then can be tested and disposed of according to whether any pollutants are present 6road salt storage areas are covered 7salt truck loading areas are swept regularly to minimize salt laden runoff drainage from the salt truck loading area is captured by an onsite basin to minimize salt laden discharges from the facility passed 8111 108408 waste handling and disposal a this section summarizes the preferred storage and disposal practices for some common municipal facility wastes for many wastes reusing or recycling is the most cost effective means to prevent pollution bthe waste handling and disposal procedures for this facility are as follows 1general shop trash will be kept in a dumpster with the lid closed the dumpster is kept in a paved area and kept clean by picking up dropped trash and sweeping the area regularly 2liquid wastes are kept out of the dumpster and the lid is kept closed to keep storm water out 3scrap metal or other materials kept outdoors are covered by a roof or tarpaulin scrap parts or other metals are kept in a shed or under a roof out of the rain 4waste metal is collected for delivery to a scrap metal dealer 5empty drums stored outdoors are sealed to be watertight 6hazardous materials or wastes are stored in accordance with the hazardous materials management plan for the facility and are kept in a covered area or in a locked area 7waste oil antifreeze spent solvents and other liquids from vehicle maintenance activities are recycled 8spent batteries are disposed of as hazardous waste or returned for reclamation and reuse passed 8111 108409 vehicle and equipment washingsteam cleaning wash water for municipal equipment is discharged to the sanitary sewer and is not allowed in storm drains steam cleaning is done on the facility only in an area equipped to capture all the water and other wastes steam cleaning wash water is prohibited from storm drains the vehicle and equipment washingsteam cleaning bmps for this facility are as follows avehicles and equipment are washed only in designated areas bwash areas are paved and clearly marked csumps or drain lines are installed to collect wash water for treatment and discharge to the sanitary sewer  reuse for repeated washings  or recycle used elsewhere onsite dthe wash area is graded or bermed to prevent storm water run on ewashing takes place on gravel grass or other permeable surfaces fuse only biodegradable soaps gequipment and vehicle washing takes place inside a building designed for maintenance or equipment storage all drains from the wash area are connected to the sanitary sewer and no storm water contacts the area ha commercial car wash is used to wash the facility vehicles and equipment passed 8111 108410 materials receiving areas a truck loading and unloading areas are potential sources of potential pollutants when rainfall and runon contact spilled raw materials dust and motor fluids that accumulate in these areas bthe bmps for the designated loading and unloading areas are as follows 1shipments are inspected for leaked motor fluids spilled materials debris and other foreign materials 2the loading and unloading area must be swept passed 8111 108411 vehicle and equipment maintenance and storage areas whenever possible vehicle and equipment maintenance is performed in an indoor garage outdoor vehicle maintenance takes place in an area designated for vehicle maintenance athe following are the selected bmps for vehicle and equipment maintenance at the facility 1equipment will be kept clean so that a buildup of grease and oil will not wash away when the equipment is exposed to rain 2vehicle and equipment maintenance areas are paved with concrete wherever possible 3drip pans or containers are kept under the vehicles at all times during maintenance 4fluids are drained from any retired vehicles kept onsite for scrap or parts stored or outof service vehicles awaiting restoration or service and vehicles being held for resale are checked periodically for leakage drip pans or containers are to be kept under the vehicles 5a berm or other runoff controls will be installed to prevent runon and runoff drainage will be directed to a connection to the sanitary sewer system bvehicle and equipment storage areas will be operated with some similar precautions 1vehicles and equipment will be inspected to identify sources of spills or leaks designated facility personnel will perform regular walkby inspection 2the equipment yard will be kept clean and clear of debris and litter because any runoff then becomes an illegal discharge to the storm drain 3storm drain inlets will be cleaned on a regular schedule and also after large storms special attention will be paid to the kinds of potential pollutants that accumulate there as a result of facility activities so that appropriate measures can be taken to control any pollutant sources 4improvements to a vehicle or equipment storage areas should grade the area to slope to a longitudinal drain or install curbs to direct all direct storm water to a single point of discharge to easily visually monitor the storm water discharge if the vehicle or equipment yard is a large source of oily materials then the inlet will be fitted with an oilwater separator or oilgrease trap 5consistent parking spots will be designated for each vehicle so that if a leak is indicated on the ground the truck can be identified and repaired 6a special area will be constructed for the facilitys dirtiest equipment tar equipment asphalt paving equipment etc in order to handle the discharges leaks and runoff separately with more intensive bmps 7spills will be cleaned up promptly  using dry cleanup procedures described in passed 8111 108412 vehicle and equipment fueling areas a vehicle and equipment fueling areas are designed and operated to minimize the potential for spilled fuel and leaked fluids coming into contact with storm water even very small spills when they happen every day add up to a lot of fuel in the drainage system bthe following are the selected bmps for the proper operation of a fueling area at the facility 1a paved area or concrete slab will be used for the fueling area concrete is preferred because fuel and oils cause asphalt to deteriorate 2gasoline overflows and spills will be cleaned using dry methods as described in spills will not be allowed to run off or evaporate and will not be flushed with a hose absorbent material will be used and disposed of as described in 3dry cleanup materials will be kept in the fueling area and employees will be instructed in the proper dry clean up methods described in facility personnel will inspect the area every day for gasoline motor oil or other fluids that may have leaked 4all fuels must be in an

features will be added to various parts of the storm water conveyance system at the city properties to help control potential pollutants in the storm water before it leaves the site aoilabsorbent materials oils and greases storm water can be removed using oil absorbent materials to contain oil spills the absorbent material preferentially absorbs oil and does not fill with water so it can be used on storm water with small concentrations of oily materials bpermanent floating booms installed in storm water ditches to control occasional light surface sheen when the boom is spent it is full of oil and is visibly heavier and floats lower in the water the booms are inexpensive enough that they may easily be replaced whenever the absorbent is saturated cvegetated swale or channel plants provide peak flow control by slowing the water and remove some pollutants by encouraging the deposition of sediments and intercepting oily wastes that may be in the water this control can be retrofitted to an existing storm water conveyance simply by allowing grasses to grow if it does not interfere with storm water drainage and cause water to back up onto the site dcatch basin filters storm drain inlets or inlet inserts that contains filtration media or other design features to removes particulates and oily wastes from storm water as it enters the storm drain passed 8111 108416

plan is thus the primary item of reference in establishment of the proposed districts certain existing physical features and developments strongly indicated parts of the proposed map as an example the special residence districts flood plain district and lagoon district were in large measure already determined by prior developments all districts were influenced by existing land use residential districts were further influenced by historical development existing lot sizes and proximity to the present center of the city and to major highways commercial areas were influenced by the purposes they would serve and by the existing highway pattern the specific type of commercial district used was determined by the need of the area concerned the needs of the overall city and the existing commercial uses a separate study map was made showing the location and amount of land commercially used a comparison was then made in tabular form of the amounts of land commercially used zoned and proposed the amount of land proposed for commercial zoning by the staff was a large reduction from that currently zoned but a substantial increase over that currently used industrial land was located recognizing railroads highways existing industrial uses and residential neighborhoods the separate industrial districts used have been located to take advantage of available facilities and to be in accord with nearby uses it should be noted that the zoning map contained in the report as well as the text is the result of numerous meetings with the study committee all questions concerning map districts were resolved by a consensus of committee opinion after a review of staff recommendations therefore map and text proposals shown in this report should not necessarily be construed as being
