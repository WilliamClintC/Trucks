of this article is to protect the public health safety and welfare of city residents and to protect property values quality of life and natural systems relating to stormwater runoff control and management the city finds it is a matter of public concern and benefit to protect water bodies and properties within the city and to reduce the future need for public expenditures relating to flooding water quality and stormwater system maintenance both the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff are a matter of public concern 386 72312 findings and objectives the city finds that stormwater regulation and management is a matter of public health safety and welfare because 1 water bodies roadways structures and other property within and downstream of the city are at times subjected to flooding 2 flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the city and the region 3 changes in land use alter the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased stormwater runoff rates and volumes which further result in increased flooding increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and deposition 4 stormwater runoff produced by changes in land use contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants 386 72312 scope a these provisions shall apply to all construction projects for areas of

standards a stormwater management areas and facilities stormwater management areas and facilities whether onsite or offsite shall be designed constructed and maintained to prevent flooding and protect water quality the design of any stormwater management system shall be based upon a 25year frequency 24hour duration storm event in order to be approved all stormwater management plans must meet the following performance standards 1 runoff runoff leaving the site shall be controlled to a nonerosive velocity both during and after construction 2 minimum treatment volume a a minimum treatment volume is established to provide pollutant removal pretreatment for prevalent precipitation events the minimum treatment volume standard shall be either one inch of runoff from the entire site or the calculated site runoff from the 90 percent annual nonexceedance storm which is one inch for the city use of the us geological service usgs runoff curve number method is the preferred means to calculate site runoff b a minimum treatment volume standard is not required where site conditions are such that tss concentrations in stormwater discharges will not exceed 80 mg1 3 channel protection criteria a channel protection criteria are established to protect stream channel bed and banks from excessive flows the channel protection criteria is to maintain postdevelopment site runoff volume and peak flow rate at or below existing levels for all storms up to the twoyear 24hour event existing levels means the runoff flow volume and rate for the last land use prior to the planned new

proscribe both permitted and restricted uses that provide progressive best management practices for stormwater quality protection 1 zone 1stream side protection zone 1 begins at the edge of the stream bank or wetland and extends 25 feet upgradient and perpendicular to the protected natural feature zone 1 shall contain undisturbed natural vegetation allowable uses within this zone are restricted to flood control structures utility rightsofway foot paths and road crossings where permitted highly restricted vegetative trimmings and removal of woody brushtrees is allowed to provide a limited view shed of the protected natural feature 2 zone 2outer zone the outer zone zone 2 begins at the outer limit of the stream side protection zone zone 1 and extends 25 feet allowable uses within the outer zone are biking or hiking paths approved stormwater management facilities approved recreational facilities and removal of mature tree cover shrub and herbaceous ground cover are to be protected from disturbance 3 permitted activities the following actions are permitted within zones 1 and 2 provided the activity is undertaken in accordance with recognized best management practices other regulatory restrictions may apply such as actions that may require separate federal state or local permit or permitbyrule provisions i stream restoration projects conducted with advice and guidance of the county conservation district and dnrdeq officials ii removal of individual trees that are in danger of falling causing damage to structures or causing blockage of the stream iii timber cutting techniques approved by state agencies under advice and guidance for purposes of forest management due to pest infestation disease or threat from fire iv riparian buffers are intended to grow into their vegetative target state naturally  however active methods to enhance successional process reforestation or to ensure preservation and propagation of the buffer are allowed 4 width of each zone the width of each zone may need to be increased if steep slopes are within close proximity of the protected natural feature guidelines of the us geological service may be used to determine the required equivalent length of vegetative filter capacity needed for slopes in excess of 15 percent 5 encouragement of voluntary measures lands adjacent to the outer edge of the outer zone zone 2 are hereby defined as riparian lands riparian property owners have a unique and critical role in protecting water quality preserving critical natural features and accommodating wildlife whose survival depends upon water features and conservation corridors for example some studies suggest that riparian buffers of 150 feet may be required for certain michigan threatened species to successfully move between larger conservation areas and maintain healthy breeding populations therefore it is a policy of the city to educate outreach and otherwise assist riparian landowners in the implantation of additional voluntary stormwater best management practices b stormwater storage facilities stormwater storage facilities which protect water quality and prevent adverse flooding onsite and offsite shall be
