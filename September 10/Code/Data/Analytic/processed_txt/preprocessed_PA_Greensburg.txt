wherever they impose greater restrictions than those imposed by other laws ordinances rules regulations or permits or by easements agreements or covenants  2653 community development objectives  2654 interpretation and intent a this chapter is one of the available legal instruments to implement community development objectives the master plan is hereby designated as the official statement of the citys intentions regarding either the preservation or change of land use b the intent of this chapter as developed and applied at this time and as may bear relationship to the master plan is 1 zoning districts are intended to give protection to the existing development of the city until such time as it becomes necessary and possible to change the form and matter of existing development and achieve a new development that is attractive stable and in accord with sound economic planning principles 2 the zoning text contains standards and as amended in the future should contain such additional or revised standards that may when appropriate be applied to areas of prospective change that can permit and guide that change into desirable and in some cases new patterns of land use relationships 3 the master plan shall serve as a reference and a guide to the planning commission in its recommendations and to the council in its legislative actions amending the zoning to the form and direction which these amendments should take to be consistent with a predeveloped scheme of land use relationships and to avoid changes that may be considered discriminatory arbitrary or capricious 159 editors

sections of articles iv to x inclusive and any illustrative drawings are to be considered explanatory and directive only to be used in interpreting the intent of the aforesaid articles and the application of the provisions illustrated but not a part of this chapter in establishing applicable regulations or provisions160 a in interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the health safety morals and general welfare of the city of greensburg b it is fundamental to the purpose of the chapter to recognize that many existing lots throughout the city are less adequate than others because of their location or size or odd shape or difficult topography or any combination of these limitations a claim of hardship under this chapter therefore shall not be allowed on behalf of any lot because the physical characteristics of the lot prevent it from being built upon exactly as in another lot abutting or close to it or in the same zoning district the regulations herein permit most such lots to be satisfactorily built upon there can be some alleviation for other lots minor concessions granted by the zoning hearing board when special physical conditions make literal enforcement of the regulations either unsatisfactory in the interest of the people at large or actually impossible it is not the ordinance but the physical conditions that prevent a lot from accommodating a type or area or bulk of structure unsuited to it for a typical example it is not intended that each lot in a general residence district automatically become the prospective site for a multiplefamily dwelling and use if a lot in such a district after provision of the yards and other open spaces prescribed for its own and adjacent property protection has a buildable area too small in extent or dimensions for a multiplefamily dwelling then the lot may be used under its district regulations for another type of dwelling or structure permitted in that district 160 editors note the preambles and drawings are on file and available for inspection in the city offices  2654 greensburg code  2655  article ii

northsouth local streets although the building patterns show a highly developed area large gaps in building fabric are evident in the center of the area indicating an area of opportunity the area is largely devoid of internal open spaces it is however adjacent to two major open spaces seton hill university shu and mount odin park municipal golf course these are largely inaccessible from the district because of intervening barriers topographic maps indicate a district dominated by dramatic elevation changes the center of the district is a hilltop and the location of excela westmoreland

buildings parking lots and rundown properties at the same time with the revitalization of the downtown the strength of the hospital shu and the historic residential areas this area is receiving increasing interest from investors and private developers  2654039 purpose the health care district is designed to permit economically sustainable development in the area unlock the potential of historic land use patterns and buildings and provide the foundation for longterm private reinvestment in the district in order to market and promote the city of greensburg and the health care district

noncompliance added 10141991 by   265106 legislative findings it is hereby determined and declared as a matter of legislative findings that  265107 purpose a nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures present a serious obstacle to the accomplishment of the purposes and intent of this chapter and the master plan upon which it is based b nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures impede the development of healthful safe and economically sound neighborhoods and districts disrupt harmonious interrelationships between otherwise permitted uses and depreciate the usefulness and convenience of the surrounding land uses and structures c continuation of nonconforming uses nonconforming structures and noncomplying signs in many instances results in an unfortunate and undesired preferred status in that adherence of adjoining properties to the provisions of the zoning to place such nonconforming uses nonconforming structures and noncomplying signs especially commercial ones in a monopolistic position within the district secured by the provisions and requirements of the zoning d nonconforming and noncomplying signs should be classified and regulated apart from other structures and uses because they are uses in the field of vision relative to highways and other public and open places rather than uses related directly to the land upon which they are located e experience has shown that generally nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures do not tend to disappear or to be converted into conforming uses and structures by the mere passage of time a this chapter establishes separate districts each of which is an appropriate area for the location of the uses and structures which are permitted in that district when meeting the established standards of the district with respect to height density open space and other requirements it is necessary and consistent with the establishment of these districts that nonconforming uses nonconforming structures and noncomplying signs which substantially and adversely affect the orderly development and taxable value of other property in the district not be permitted to continue without restriction  265106

signs to provide for the regulation of such uses and structures and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which nonconforming uses nonconforming structures and noncomplying signs shall be permitted to continue and to encourage the ultimate termination of such uses and structures a the nonconforming use of land where such use is the principal use of the property and no main structure is involved may be continued for a period of not more than three years from the date the use became or becomes nonconforming provided that there shall be no expansion or extension of such use  and if any such use is discontinued the future use of said land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter a nonconforming use shall be considered to be abandoned and discontinued if such use ceases for a period of three years b except as otherwise provided in this section a nonconforming use of a structure may be continued but shall not thereafter be changed except as may be authorized as a special exception by the board see  265129 a nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout those existing parts of the structure which were arranged or designed for such use c a nonconforming structure other than a sign may be moved extended enlarged or structurally altered if the natural expansion and growth of the operations conducted therein require such moving extension
