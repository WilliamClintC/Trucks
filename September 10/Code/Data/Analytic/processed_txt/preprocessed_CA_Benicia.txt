and made a part hereof as if fully set out in this chapter with the additions insertions deletions and changes if any prescribed in bmc  this code adopts changes modifications and requirements not mandated by the california fire cfc and international fire ifc because of local climatic geological or topographical conditions the modifications are needed due to the following local conditions that exist in benicia and on the following findings a the city is geographically situated in an area subject to frequent periods of strong gusty winds from the southwest and north in addition temperatures during the summer months range from 80 to 100plus degrees during this period the relative humidity can fall below 20 percent the city contains a significant amount of hilly undeveloped acreage designated as permanent open space this wildlandurban interface in conjunction with the hot dry and windy climatic conditions creates a hazardous situation that has led to extensive grass and brush fires in recent years with more development extending into and adjacent to the open space areas heat and winddriven fires could lead to serious consequences b the city is divided by several topographic features including interstates 680 and 780 as a result the city is primarily divided into three parts traffic within and between the parts of the city is channeled onto several major thoroughfares that must cross freeways by way of underpasses and overpasses in addition it is bordered on two sides by the carquinez straits periodic heavy traffic congestion on the citys major streets and interstates acts as a barrier to timely response for fire and emergency service vehicles because of traffic or accidents there could be times that fire equipment could be sufficiently slowed to increase the risk of substantial structural damage with the possibility of fire services unable to guarantee rapid response to various sections of the city during these times it is necessary to mitigate this problem by requiring adequate access road construction allowing apparatus approach and other features to aid mitigation efforts c the city is subject to ground tremors from seismic events on the san andreas concordgreen valley hayward andor other major active faults in the greater san francisco bay area the concordgreen valley fault is immediately adjacent to the city to the north seismological evidence indicates the probability of an earthquake in the region capable of doing significant damage to buildings is high a major seismic event would create a citywide demand on fire protection services which would be beyond the response capability of the fire department this problem can be lessened or mitigated by requiring initial fire control installation of automatic fire protection systems     adoption by reference a international fire that portion of the california building standards imposes substantially the same requirements as are contained in the international

promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory the federal standard if more stringent than limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that subcategory shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this chapter users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the city may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections e and f of this section b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentrations for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the city shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e d a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following subsections of this section 1 categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of subsection d2 of this section are met 2 criteria a either i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters b credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere c credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section d credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result e when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the city the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections e1a e of this section 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flowmonitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flowmonitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the superintendent whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection e1c of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the city will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection e1a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the city a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as for treatment pursuant to bmc  the industrial user must also be in compliance with the regulations regarding the prohibition of bypass f the superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the superintendent in addition the superintendent will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 g once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical pretreatment standard from which the equivalent limitations were derived h many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating daily maximum discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both average and the maximum equivalent limitations i any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the superintendent within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the superintendent of such anticipated change will be

is found that in the event of a strong or moderate local earthquake loss of life or serious injury may result from damage to or collapse of buildings in the city of benicia it is generally acknowledged that benicia will experience earthquakes in the future due to its proximity to both the san andreas and hayward faults the purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety by identifying potentially hazardous buildings in benicia which are not earthquake resistant by reason of structural deficiencies the city council finds that the existence and occupancy of potentially hazardous buildings constitute a threat to public safety in the event of earthquake of moderate to high magnitude the city council finds that the public safety is served by identifying potentially hazardous buildings and providing for notification of legal owners and their tenants that the building is considered to be one of a general type that historically has exhibited little resistance to earthquake motion such a seismic hazards identification program is consistent with the state unreinforced masonry law of 1986 ns  definitions for the purposes of this chapter a bearing wall means any
