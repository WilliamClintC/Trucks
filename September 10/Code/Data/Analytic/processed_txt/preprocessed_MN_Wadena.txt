rightofway the city strives to keep its rightofway in a state of good repair and free from unnecessary encumbrances although the general population bears the financial burden for the upkeep of the rightofway a primary cause for the early and excessive deterioration of its rightofway is frequent excavation 1rightofway obstruction is a source of frustration for merchants business owners and the general population which must avoid these obstructions or change travel or shopping plans because of them and has a detrimental effect on commerce persons whose equipment is within the rightofway are the primary cause of these frequent obstructions 2the city holds the rightsofway within its geographical boundaries as an asset in trust for its citizens the city and other public entities have invested millions of dollars in public funds to build and maintain the rightsofway it also recognizes that some persons by placing their equipment in the rightofway and charging the citizens of the city for goods and services delivered thereby are using this property held for the public good although such services are often necessary or convenient for the citizens such persons receive revenue andor profit use of public property 3as a result of all these intrusions in the rightofway it is necessary for the city to establish a system of documenting what is placed in the rightsofway within its municipal boundaries and to serve as a central record agency to inform its citizens and the other public entities of the facilities that have been placed in the rightofway that is held in trust

by the public utilities commission puc on maximum restoration requirements minn rules pts  creimbursement payments in addition to the foregoing recovery of costs and regulation of use the council determines that there is an existing and legitimate state and local public policy which authorizes the city to require payments as reimbursement or return to the public for the use value of the public rightsofway from those who obtain revenue or profits from such use this reimbursement is provided for and defined in this section as the user fee this fee does not apply to the repair replacement or reconstruction of an existing facility telecommunication facilities are exempt from a user fee by state statute dpublic interest and welfare the council finds that it is in the public interest to provide for the payment of a user fee by all persons who use and occupy the rightofway to pay an annual lease if not a franchised entity apportioned equally among them all for the value and benefit of using such rightofway elegislative power in these situations the council desires to exercise its lawful police power and common law authority and all statutory authority which is available to it

the public interest will be best protected by adopting this chapter conferring the right to occupy the rightofway in return for payment as authorized by law fnot a rate the council finds and determines that the user fee authorized by this chapter is not and is not intended to be a rate as that term is defined in ms  216b02 subd 5 as it may be amended from time to time such user fee is not a fee for a service that is provided to the customer or a person using the rightofway but is rather a fee paid for the right of that person to operate in the public rightofway and to maintain the

series passed 10242003  11502 findings and conclusions of the council afindings 1the council makes the following findings regarding the need to license sexuallyoriented businesses 2the findings are based upon the citys review and analysis of numerous studies reports articles judicial decisions and the experience and legislative findings of other cities around the country concerning the impacts or secondary effects of sexuallyoriented businesses and the sale distribution and display of sexuallyoriented materials collectively sexuallyoriented business activities on the areas in which such activities are located or take place a1sexuallyoriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending places of worship children attending licensed family day care homes statelicensed group family day care homes and statelicensed child care centers clients attending statelicensed developmental achievement centers students attending school and people using public parks and recreational areas 2sexuallyoriented businesses can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity thereby taxing crime prevention law enforcement and public health services the experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and operation of the businesses can however minimize this risk provided the owners and operators of the facilities are regulated by licensing or other procedures bsexuallyoriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area in which the businesses are located thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for city residents c1the concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses in one area can have a substantially detrimental effect on the area in which the businesses are concentrated and on the overall quality of life in the community 2a cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses the presence of the businesses is often perceived by others as an indication that the community or area is deteriorating and the result can be devastating to other businesses that may be required to move out of the vicinity and which could influence residents to relocate from the area 3it has been noted that the presence of the businesses can have the overall effect of causing declining real estate values which result can be exacerbated by the concentration of the businesses which can erode the citys tax base and contribute to overall blight dsexuallyoriented businesses can increase the risk of exposure to communicable diseases including but not limited to acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids for which currently there is no cure experiences of other cities indicate that the businesses can facilitate the spread of communicable diseases by virtue of the design and use of the premises thereby endangering not only the patrons of the establishments but also the general public esexuallyoriented businesses can cause or contribute to public health problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with

this subchapter is to establish predictable and balanced regulations for the siting and screening of wireless telecommunication equipment in order to accommodate the growth of wireless communication systems within the city while protecting the public against any adverse impacts on the citys aesthetic resources and the public welfare this subchapter creates two categories of support structures for antennas the first category consists of existing towers water towers and highdensity residential and nonresidential buildings which the subchapter favors in order to minimize the number of freestanding towers needed to serve the community the second category consists of all other support structures the structures in this second category are all classified as freestanding telecommunications towers even if they are intended to replace existing light poles utility poles or similar structures freestanding towers are subject to increased standards to minimize their visual impact one such standard is that towers in residential and commercial zoning districts must use stateoftheart stealth design techniques to disguise the towers and soften their views a telecommunications company that does not currently use stealth technology will need to develop this capability in order to place freestanding towers in this city this subchapter allows minimal use of the public rightofway for telecommunication antennas because that space should be reserved for public utilities and should be free of safety hazards in addition telecommunications facilities located in the rightofway have the potential of being very visible to the traveling public in order to locate in a public rightofway telecommunications companies must use improved technology to reduce the size and visibility of their facilities rd series passed 11152016  15281 definitions the following additional definitions apply to this subchapter in addition to the definitions contained in  15202 of
