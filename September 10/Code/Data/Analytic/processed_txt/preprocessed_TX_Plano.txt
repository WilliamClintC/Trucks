these requirements are intended to inform the applicant of the citys expectations expedite the city staffs review process of tia reports provide standard criteria for evaluating development proposals and establish equitable mitigation and cost sharing policies 2 a tia is intended to develop publicprivate partnerships to coordinate land use and transportation facility development both the city of plano and the land developer share in the responsibility to consider all reasonable solutions to identified transportation problems 3 tias must be performed as part of the site plan process with the goal of identifying the relationship between land use and transportation needs the site plan process is a multistep land development approval process that includes a series of three plans a concept plan preliminary site plan and site plan  definitions base volumes base volumes for site plans shall be based on current traffic counts adjusted to the expected date of project occupancy when available all base data shall be supplied by the citys transportation division in all cases when ground counts are needed and are not available the developer or his agent shall be required to collect such data design year the design year is the point in time upon which assumptions pertaining to land use population employment and transportation facilities are based all site plan analysis shall use

local conditions transportation improvements program tip a 5year schedule and funding program of all approved and committed transportation improvements  applicability 1 purpose a tia at the time of site plan approval is intended to define the immediate impacts of the proposed development and any necessary transportation improvements public or private required to ensure a satisfactory level of service on all affected thoroughfares a site plan tia is designed to mitigate traffic impacts by optimizing roadway capacity access design and traffic control a tia may not be used to deny development permitted by zoning nor shall it be used to modify road design contrary to the comprehensive plan or to the thoroughfare standards rules & regulations specific improvements to the existing roadways consistent with the thoroughfare plan may be needed to gain approval of site plan proposals timing of and cost sharing agreements for the construction of offsite improvements also may be considered 2 goal the goal of this study is to review a specific development of known size and use and to determine the effect of that use on the existing roadway system by analyzing existing traffic volumes and existing roadway configurations this process ensures that the roadway system is adequate to accommodate the proposed use 3 requirements the tia process shall be required simultaneous with the site plan approval process for projects generating 8000 trips per day or greater a tia is typically required with the submission of the preliminary site plan  however the city may require the tia to be submitted with a concept plan or site plan due to project phasing it is the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate that a tia is not required recommendations shall be made for mitigation measures necessary to ensure efficient traffic flow around the proposed site as based on intersection and roadway levels of service on all preliminary site plans andor site plans site plan applications as defined herein not containing tias will be judged incomplete and shall not be forwarded to the planning & zoning commission for action  methodology the methodology and procedures of

date shall be indicated e impact determination determine the level of service for all thoroughfares and intersections in the study area the analysis shall contain the following minimum information i proposed trip generation calculate total trip generation by use assuming full development and occupancy and report any reductions for passerby mixed use etc as permitted by generation rates show trip generation by use in tabular form with land use trip generation rates and trips generated ii trip distribution and assignment trips generated by the proposed development are to be added to the base volumes projected for the design year peak hour volumes must be calculated distribution assumptions and assignment calculations must be provided iii level of service analysis show in tabular form

percent increase in total traffic produced by the proposed site plan identify any operational problems eg drives median openings and signalization within 500 feet of the site f mitigation traffic levels exceeding level of service d where the development is contributing five percent or more of the total trips should be mitigated if possible mitigation measures are limited to the following i requirements in addition to those provided in the thoroughfare standards rules & regulations relating to driveway and median opening location design and distance between drives ii onsite improvements including access controls and site circulation adjustments iii offsite improvements including the construction of additional lanes where the surrounding thoroughfares are not fully developed or intersection improvements where the surrounding area is approaching full development cost for offsite improvements that are consistent with the thoroughfare plan shall be repaid by the city in accordance with its cost sharing policies as funds become available as required by the citys subdivision improvements must be consistent with the thoroughfare plan and are subject to the availability of rightofway and other design constraints as determined by the director of engineering 3 planning & zoning commission report the planning & zoning commission shall make a finding on all tia studies reviewed in conjunction with site plans that based upon the tia the thoroughfares can accommodate anticipated traffic volumes at an acceptable level of service where identified impacts cannot be adequately mitigated by the date of occupancy the planning & zoning commission shall recommend one or more of the following actions a amendment of the community investment program cip to expedite construction of needed related public improvements b changes in intersection design signal systems etc to increase capacity  appeals applicants may request city council reconsideration of a tia and

of plano p&z commission approved  city council city of plano soa2017001  ord no 2017114 january 2018 city of plano subdivision ordinance introduction and procedural overview the subdivision the city of plano is designed to prepare land for development prior to submission of applications a preapplication meeting is required the purpose of the meeting is to review potential subdivision design before formal submittal city of plano engineering and planning staff will discuss stormwater impacts of the proposed development and opportunities to comply with stormwater quality and quantity goals of planos texas pollution discharge elimination system tpdes permit the process for gaining subdivision approval depends on the size and complexity of the subdivision minor subdivisions which are subdivisions of four or fewer lots requiring no public improvements may be approved by staff in a onestep process approval of major plats may involve from one to three steps depending on the nature of development in addition remainders of tracts being subdivided and parcels smaller than five acres but not proposed for improvement or development may in some instances be approved in a onestep process under the conveyance plat provisions of the ordinance some types of subdivisions are not regulated under this ordinance these exempt subdivisions include divisions of property where no part being created is smaller than 20 acres certain forms of leaseholds divisions created divisions created by the action of a court of law however no property may be developed without an approved plat the general process of subdivision approval is described below this description does not substitute for the actual regulations contained in articles 17 1 major subdivision approval process  the approval process for a major subdivision typically begins with the preparation of a concept plan this plan establishes a general schematic for the site development primarily focusing on vehicular access and circulation concept plans may be used to separate large properties into parts for phasing site planning and development a concept plan may be as simple as a plan defining the location of arterial or collector streets shown on the citys thoroughfare plan however a concept plan may also show the preliminary layout of local streets and lots approval of a concept plan showing the proposed street and lot layout is required prior to the submittal of a preliminary plat for a residential subdivision concept plans may be used to define a phasing plan for the development of property in this case areas proposed for immediate development will be more detailed than future phases of the development concept plans for multiphased projects may be amended and refined as subsequent phases are ready to proceed subdivision approval process the approval of a preliminary plat is the second step in processing a major subdivision the preliminary plat must generally conform to the approved concept plan for the property the preliminary plat is a detailed fully dimensional plat and engineered plan for the subdivision following the approval of the preliminary plat by the commission and the release of the engineering plans by the director of engineering the developer soa2017001  ord no 2017114 january 2018 may begin construction of the site improvements the preliminary plat may not be filed with the county clerk nor may lots be sold with preliminary plat approval the final stage of the subdivision process is approval of the final plat once the improvements have been constructed inspected and approved for acceptance by the director of engineering the final plat may be presented to the commission for approval all corrections and alterations to the plat are made prior to approval thus eliminating the reasons for most replats if improvements have not been completed or if minor corrections are needed the developer and the city may enter into an improvement agreement specifying the work remaining and providing necessary surety for future performance this agreement can be approved concurrent with a final plat thereby allowing the plat to be filed and lots sold if the developer elects to do so he could enter into a development agreement with the city for all improvements this would only be appropriate for small subdivisions however 2 minor subdivision approval process  the ordinance provides a onestep process for minor plats a minor plat is defined as a subdivision of four or fewer lots not requiring any public improvements minor plats can be processed for either residential or nonresidential subdivisions minor plats can be approved by staff without any action by the commission 3 conveyance plats  the subdivision the need to subdivide and sell property without plans for its immediate development in addition a lot from a tract may be sold for development leaving an unimproved remainder a conveyance plat allows the recording of a subdivision without requiring the construction of public improvements this alternative is an interim step in the subdivision process and may generally be used only where the parcels or lots being created are larger than five acres a conveyance plat is a boundary survey drawn as a plat easements dedications and reservations may be recorded on a conveyance plat engineering plans are not required to process a conveyance plat unless the developer plans to construct limited improvements on the property development fees are not collected at the time of conveyance plat approval 4 review time  preliminary plats final plats and conveyance plats will be acted on within 30 days of filing all plats not acted upon within this period will be considered approved minor plats may be processed in a shorter period since they only require staff approval all other approvals require the action of the commission 5 appeals  the action of staff concerning a minor plat may be appealed to the commission the action of the commission regarding subdivision approval may be appealed to the plano city council soa2017001  ord no 2017114 january 2018 soa2017001  ord no 2017114 january 2018 i table of contents page article i general
