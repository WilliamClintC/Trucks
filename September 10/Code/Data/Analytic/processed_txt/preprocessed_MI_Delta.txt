a a person who violates any provision of this article or the terms or conditions of a license is responsible for a municipal civil infraction in accordance with article ii of chapter 20 nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the remedies available to the township in the event of a violation by a person of this article or a license b if any fines or costs associated with this article are not paid the civil infraction citation may be filed with the district court in accordance with section 2025  272011 intent a it is the intent of this chapter to give effect to the intent of the michigan medical marihuana act as approved by the electors and not to determine and establish an altered policy with regard to marihuana the act authorizes a narrow exception to the general rule and state policy that the cultivation distribution and use of marihuana amount to criminal acts it is the further intent of this chapter to protect the public health safety and general welfare of persons and property and to license certain locations as specified section 2631 this chapter is intended to comply with the act while concurrently attempting to protect the health safety and welfare of law enforcement officers and other persons in the community and also to address and minimize reasonably anticipated secondary effects upon children other members of the public and upon significant areas of the community that would be reasonably expected to occur in the absence of the provisions of this chapter this chapter is designed to recognize the fundamental intent of the act to allow for a private and confidential patientcaregiver relationship to facilitate the statutory authorization for the limited cultivation distribution and medical use of marihuana  and to regulate around this fundamental intent in a manner that does not conflict with the act so as to address issues that would otherwise expose the community and its residents to significant adverse conditions b nothing in this chapter shall be construed as allowing persons to engage in conduct that endangers others or causes a public nuisance or to allow cultivation distribution or use of marihuana contrary to the express authorizations of the act and this chapter  and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to undermine or provide immunity from federal law as it may be enforced by the federal or state government relative to the cultivation distribution or use of marihuana thus the authorization of activity and the approval of a license under this chapter shall not have the effect of superseding or nullifying federal law applicable to the cultivation distribution and use of marihuana a under the act law enforcement officers are prevented from securing the information necessary to determine whether or not the cultivation distribution and use of marihuana are being conducted by persons authorized under the act accordingly the licensure of a particular location as the site of cultivation and distribution which need not undermine the privacy and confidentiality of the parentcaregiver relationship could be critical to law enforcement in order to identify and distinguish sites of lawful activity from sites of unlawful activity b the experience in the state of california a state that approved the medical use of marihuana in 199 is that concentrations of marihuana distribution activity lead to serious secondary effects including 1 resale of products just obtained inside since marihuana dispensaries regularly attract marihuana growers drug users and drug traffickers sharing just purchased marihuana outside dispensaries  2 street dealers lurking about dispensaries to offer a lower price for marihuana to arriving patrons  3 marihuana smoking in public and in front of children in the vicinity of dispensaries  4 acquiring marihuana andor money by means of robbery of patrons going to or leaving dispensaries  5 loitering  6 an increase in burglaries at or near dispensaries  and 7 a loss of trade for other commercial businesses located near dispensaries c children are not capable of making distinctions between the lawful and unlawful use and possession of marihuana by individuals based upon the intricacies of the act therefore there is a need to insulate children from the narrowly permitted use and possession of marihuana permitted under the act d unauthorized installations of plumbing and electrical equipment relating to the cultivation of marihuana plants may create mold conditions andor a fire risk  272011 findingsof factwarranting a licenserequirement  272011 findingsof factwarrantingrestrictionsondistribution a the act reflects the intent to a private and confidential patientcaregiver relationship to facilitate the lawful cultivation distribution and use of marihuana strictly for medical purposes that is an authorization for confidential and private use of marihuana by patients and for confidential and private assistance in such use by caregivers to individual patients it is reasonable to expect and require that all undertakings of caregivers and other persons in assisting a patient are intended to occur on a confidential and private onetoone basis b the confidentiality provisions of the act reflect the intent for all caregivers and patients to remain anonymous in terms of their names and addresses thus further reflecting the private and confidential nature of the activities contemplated between a caregiver and the patient he is assisting c it is deemed necessary to maintain by licensure an environment promoting the protection efficiency and effectiveness of law enforcement officers and their work performed in connection with the cultivation distribution or use of marihuana d all of the findings stated in section 264 in support of the requirement for licensure are incorporated by reference in this section  272011 restrictionsonthedistributionofmedicalmarihuana a caregiver and any other person authorized under

access management regulations a applicability & intent the regulations and standards of this apply to all properties along west saginaw highway m43 which is a regional arterial street with the intent of optimizing traffic operations and improving public safety along west saginaw highway m43 by minimizing congestion and accident potential while still providing property owners with reasonable access the eaton county road commission and the michigan department of transportation have jurisdiction over the public roads in delta township the construction and maintenance of the public roads are subject to the requirements of these agencies the requirements and standards of this be applied in addition to and where permissible shall supersede the requirements of the michigan department of transportation eaton county road commission or other requirements of this ordinance any project involving the construction or reconstruction of a roadway shall also be subject to the provisions of the delta township complete streets ordinance b exceptions it is recognized that existing development may not be able to meet all the standards contained in this expansion or redevelopment in such cases the standards contained herein shall be applied to the maximum extent possible where the standards herein cannot be met suitable alternatives documented by a registered traffic engineer and substantially achieving the intent of the chapter may be accepted by the zoning administrator provided that all of the following apply 1 the use will generate less than five hundred 500 vehicle trips per day based on rates developed by the institute of transportation engineers 2 the use has insufficient size to meet the dimensional standards 3 adjacent development renders adherence to these standards economically unfeasible 4 there is no other reasonable access c general access requirements the following standards shall apply to all uses with frontage on or access to west saginaw highway m43 which require site plan review approval of a site plan by the township and compliance with these standards does not negate the requirement for securing access permits from the appropriate road authority either the michigan department of transpor tation or the eaton county road commission following site plan approval by the township 1 number of driveways a access to west saginaw highway m43 for an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership shall consist of either a single twoway driveway or a paired driveway system wherein one 1 driveway is designed and appropri
