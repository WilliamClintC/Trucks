with all lighting components energized the lighting intensity of any sign whether resulting from internal or external illumination shall not exceed 600 lux see note 1 below when measured with a handheld incident light meter  designed to measure illuminance  held at a distance of one foot from the sign face or the window surface in front of the sign if the sign is inside and facing out if other illuminated signs are present the sign being read should be shielded as much as possible for signs behind windows a piece of cardboard held against the window at a point close to the edge of the sign being measured reasonably shields the light from other signs for signs outside a piece of cardboard held near the edge of the sign being measured and separating it from adjacent signs will act as sufficient shielding 4maximum brightness levels for electronic signs shall not exceed 4000 nits see note 2 below when measured from the signs face at its maximum brightness during daylight hours and

shielded light source bare bulbs are prohibited flashing blinking oscillating rotating or intermittent turning onandoff of any illuminating device is prohibited timeweather informational signs and official warning and regulatory signs erected by the city or state are exempt from this regulation 6neon shall be considered indirect illumination and not a bare bulb note 1 lux is a measure of the illumination of a surface from a point source in this case the surface is the bulb on an incident light meter and the point source is the sign the light from the sign illuminates the meter at some measurable level this is what we use as a standard for smaller signs note 2 the nit is a nonsi unit of visible light intensity  the amount of light emitted from a particular area or surface  used by the sign industry in the us  the si equivalent is one candela per square meter it is an indicator of how bright a surface will appear the nit is a rather small unit of brightness  an lcd computer screen has an output of about 200300 nit the nighttime standard set in this ordinance is about 1  times as bright as a typical computer screen  the daytime standard is about 13 times brighter than this same screen sign companies can easily calculate the nit values for any given illuminated sign  these are part of the sign specifications we use this to measure the brightness of electronic signs  message boards lcd screens and the like see earlier definition of electronic signs 1007method of measurement for regulators 1maximum permitted sign area maximum permitted sign area for a premises is

and intent to protect and preserve the rights privileges and property of the citys residents and to preserve and improve the peace safety health welfare comfort and convenience of its residents the

business park light industrial agricultural and urban corridor also known as mixed use corridor all outdoor recreation facilities including the recreation facilities of the city of mount vernon cornell college and mount vernon community school district are also covered by this chapter this chapter does not include areas zoned as residential all outdoor lighting shall be installed with the idea of being a good neighbor to keep unnecessary direct light from shining onto abutting properties or streets this chapter is not intended to provide a dark sky ordinance but instead encourages lighting practices that will reduce light pollution referenced and defined as over illumination glare light trespass and sky glow it also sets standards for outdoor lighting so that its use does not interfere with the reasonable use and enjoyment of property within the city it is recognized that this chapter might need to be revised to accommodate lighting designs and fixtures that are newly developed after the adoption of this chapter 1102definitions for the purposes of this chapter terms used shall be defined as follows 1after hours lighting standard light levels during the hours of 10 pm and 6 am means of a control system or systems for outdoor general area lighting 2average light level the overall average of all points on the surface of the illuminated area including the brightest and dimmest points 3candlepower luminous intensity of a light in a specified direction measured in candelas cd eg an ordinary wax candle has a candlepower of one candela 4cut off angle of a luminaire the angle measured up from nadir between the vertical axis and the first line of sight at which the light source is not visible displayed as follows 5cutoff fixture a luminaire which has a light distribution where the candlepower does not exceed 25% of the lamps rated initial lumen output at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir and does not exceed 10% of the lamps rated initial lumen output at a vertical angle of 80 degrees above nadir this applies to all lateral angles around the luminaire 6color rendering index cri a measurement comparing the color of an object under a light source to a reference light source of comparable temperature cri values generally range from 0  100 as the cri approaches 100 the color of the lit object becomes truer or closer to the original color see appendix for chart 7footcandle fc a unit of illumination when one lumen is evenly distributed on a one square foot area 8forward throw any down light luminaire whose distribution pattern is type iv as defined by the iesna these luminaires have minimal backlight effect thereby reducing light trespass 9full cutoff fixture a luminaire which has a light distribution where the candlepower does not exceed 0% of the lamps rated initial lumen output at an angle of 90 degrees above nadir and does not exceed 10% of the lamps rated initial lumen output at a vertical angle of 80 degrees above nadir this applies to all lateral angles around the luminaire 10glare an extreme contrast between bright and dark areas in the field of view 11horizontal footcandles the amount of light being received on a horizontal

19luminaire a complete lighting unit consisting of a lamp or lamps together with the components designed to distribute the light such as reflectors refractors lenses etc 20luminance the luminous
