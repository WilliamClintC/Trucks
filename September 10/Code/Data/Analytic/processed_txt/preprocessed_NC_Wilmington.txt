lawfully existing prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be considered as nonconforming it is the intent of this article to permit these nonconformities to continue but not to encourage their perpetual use except as otherwise provided herein nonconforming structures or uses may be continued provided they conform to the provisions of this article use of undeveloped nonconforming lots a nonconforming single lot of record a vacant lot of record established prior to the effective date of this chapter which does not conform to the district in which it is located may be used as a building site for a use permitted within that district provided that all construction and the location of the building shall be in accordance with the applicable front side and rear yard requirements of the zoning district in which it is located b nonconforming contiguous lots of record if two 2 or more contiguous vacant lots of record established prior to the effective date of this chapter are in single ownership such lots at the owners option may be designated to form a single or several lots which meet the minimum front side and rear yard requirements of the zoning district in which they are located completion of nonconforming projects the construction or erection of any nonconforming project may be completed provided all construction is done pursuant to a valid building permit extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations a except as specifically provided in this section it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation b subject to subsection 18142d of this article a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this chapter was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such uses however subject to section 18141 of this chapter a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building c subject to section 18141 of this chapter a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming uses that involve the removal of natural materials from the lot eg a quarry may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if ten 10 percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this chapter d where a nonconforming situation exists the equipment or process may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in degree of activity rather than changes in kind of activity and no violations of other provisions in this chapter occur e physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land are unlawful if they result in 1 an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use  or 2 greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements height limitations or density requirements  3 greater nonconformity with respect to the exterior architectural features of the conforming structures in the part of the zoning district in which the nonconforming structure is located f minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged g notwithstanding subsection 18142e any structure used for singlefamily residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use or structure may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to yard size and setback requirements for the purposes of this chapter manufactured housing may be replaced with larger manufactured housing and singlewide manufactured housing may be replaced with a doublewide this paragraph is subject to the limitations stated in section 18144 abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations h except for onpremises and outdoor advertising signs a structure that is nonconforming in any respect or a structure that is used in a nonconforming manner may be reconstructed or replaced if partially or totally destroyed by fire act of god or other

except as provided in subsection 18142g above 4 the reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with respect to dimensional restrictions such as yard requirements height limitations or density requirements and such dimensional nonconformities must be eliminated if that can reasonably be accomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming use of such building 5 the reconstructed building may not be more nonconforming with respect to exterior architectural features than the previous building eg if a nonconforming commercial use was occurring in a building exhibiting residential exterior architectural features any reconstruction to that building must retain those residential architectural features such exterior architectural feature nonconformities must be eliminated if they can be reasonably accomplished without unduly burdening the reconstruction process or limiting the right to continue the nonconforming use of such building i a nonconforming onpremises or outdoor advertising sign shall be subject to all requirements of this chapter regarding safety maintenance and repair however if the

changed to another nonconforming use only in accordance with a special use permit issued by the city council the city council may issue such special use permit if it finds that the proposed use will be no less compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the approval is applied for if a nonconforming use is changed to any use other than a conforming use without obtaining city council approval pursuant to this paragraph that change shall constitute a discontinuance of the nonconforming use with consequences as stated in section 18144 a nonconforming accessory use or building may only be changed to another nonconforming accessory use or building as provided in this section changes in a principal use are also considered as changes to any accessory use or building the city council shall comply with the provisions of division iv of this chapter in issuing special use permits pursuant to this section the city council may issue such special use permit if it finds that all five 5 of the following factors exist 1 that the proposed use will be no less compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the approval is applied for  2 that the use will not materially endanger the public health or safety if located where proposed and developed according to the plan as submitted and approved by the issuance of the special use permit  3 that the use meets all required conditions and specifications  4 that the use will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property or that the use is a public necessity  and 5 that the location and character of the use if developed according to the plan as submitted and approved will be in harmony with the area in which it is to be located and in

issued by the city council pursuant to this section d an application for city council approval pursuant to this section may be made up to one hundred eighty 180 days following abandonment or discontinuance of the previous nonconforming use provided 1 that the premises has not been used for a conforming purpose at any time following the discontinuance of the previous nonconforming use  and 2 that this subsection shall not be construed as extending the period specified in subsection 18144a      12710   5316 abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations a when a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty 180 days the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes except for those structures qualifying under subsection 18142h b for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one 1 apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one 1 space in a nonconforming manufactured housing park for one hundred eighty 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or manufactured housing park as a whole is continuously maintained if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for one hundred eighty 180 days shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter for example if manufactured housing is used as a nonconforming use on the residential lot where a conforming residential structure also is located removal of that manufactured housing for one hundred eighty 180 days terminates the right to replace it c when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued on the effective date of this chapter the one hundred eightyday period for purposes of this section begins on the effective date of this chapter nonconformities created by public action when lot area or setbacks are reduced as a result of conveyance to a federal state or local government for a public purpose and the remaining area is at least seventyfive 75 percent of the required minimum dimensional standard for the district in which it is located then that lot shall be deemed in compliance with the minimum lot size and setback standards of this ordinance without the need to obtain a variance from the board of adjustment for new development or existing structures made nonconforming as a result of the conveyance  41514 secs 1814618154  reserved division ii  vested rights establishment of a vested right a a vested right shall

citys overall housing strategy which seeks to meet the needs of a population diverse in age income household composition and individual needs a variety of housing types and price points innovation and variety in housing design and site development these developments are intended to foster a strong sense of community use of common space development standards for singlefamily courtyards are intended to create a small community of homes oriented around open space courtyard that is pedestrianoriented provides for pedestrian amenities minimizes the visibility of offstreet parking and takes advantage of natural features on the site the development standards are intended to maintain the traditional amenities and proportions associated with these pocket neighborhoods while ensuring that these housing developments contribute to the overall community character courtyard developments typically allow higher densities than are allowed in the underlying zoning districts this increased density is possible use of smaller than average home sizes clustered parking and site design standards courtyard housing developments are encouraged to use lowimpact development techniques to the greatest extent possible performance standards for housing unit density separation between developments impervious surface areas building heights and sizes are employed in cottage developments to improve predictability in the design review and approach of such projects these standards also reduce the impacts of increased density prevent overbuilding of the site and limit the amount of offstreet parking necessary to serve the development because of the limited building size and typically smaller household size parking requirements are reduced  parking should be designed to minimize visibility

buffer is intended to promote high water quality in the creeks and sounds to protect the public health and to ensure the protection of the natural resources within the city of wilmington a properly vegetated buffer is essential to filter and biologically process nutrient rich runoff animal wastes and sediment before it enters coastal creeks canals and rivers buffers also function to moderate water temperatures maintain the desired dissolved oxygen levels in the water and stabilize the soils immediately adjoining the stream in urban environments the function of a buffer is especially critical to the balance of the plant and animal life in fresh and saltwater creeks buffers are most effective when they contain native and naturalized plants appropriate in size adaptability salt tolerance wind tolerance etc and hardiness for the area plants requiring intensive or routine maintenance should be avoided in buffer areas 2 applicability a portion of the conservation resource

council recognizes however that due to the particular nature of a tract of land or the nature of the facilities proposed for installation or other factors the underlying objectives of this section may be achieved even though the standards are not adhered to with mathematical precision therefore the board is authorized to permit minor deviations from these standards whenever it determines that a the objectives underlying these standards can be met without strict adherence to them  b because of peculiarities in the developers tract of land or the facilities proposed it would be unreasonable to

purpose the purpose of this article is to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to the health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require the uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of city of wilmington are subject to periodic inundation that may result in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which may adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards the objectives of this article are to protect human life safety and health  minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in flood prone areas  minimize damage to private and public property due to flooding  make flood insurance available to the community national flood insurance program  maintain the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain  help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas  and ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area a 3706   71718 scope  full compliance required this article

development be known as the comprehensive stormwater  it is referred to herein as this ordinance  91509 authority the city is authorized to adopt this ordinance pursuant to north carolina law including but not limited to of the constitution of north carolina  of the wilmington city charter  gs  1432147 160a174 160a175 160a185  gs ch 160a art 19  and north carolina session law 2004163  91509 findings it is hereby determined that increasing impervious surfaces alters the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology that are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this ordinance therefore the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge  91509 purpose a general the purpose of this ordinance is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of constructionrelated and postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure  safeguard the public health safety and general welfare  and protect water and aquatic resources b specific this ordinance seeks to meet its general purpose following specific objectives and means 1 establish decisionmaking processes for development that protect the integrity of watersheds and preserve the health of water resources  2 require that new development redevelopment and expansion maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable for the twoyear tenyear and 25year design storms to reduce flooding stream bank erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and increases in stream temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and review criteria for the construction function and use of structural stormwater bmps that may be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of better management and site design practices such as the use of vegetated conveyances for stormwater and the preservation of green space riparian buffers and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater bmps to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained appropriately and pose no threat to public safety  7 establish administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans for the inspection of approved projects and to assure appropriate longterm maintenance  8 coordinate site design plans that include open space and natural areas with the intent and policies of the comprehensive plan and the wilmingtonnew hanover county cama plan  91509   5316 applicability and jurisdiction a general beginning with and subsequent to its effective date this ordinance shall be applicable to all
