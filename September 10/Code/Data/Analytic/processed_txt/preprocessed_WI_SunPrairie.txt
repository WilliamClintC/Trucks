presented in hearings and in reports made available to the common council and findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986  young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976  and barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991  and on studies in other communities including but not limited to dallas texas 1997  houston texas 1997  garden grove oklahoma 1991  and beaumont texas 1982  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the common council finds 1 sexually oriented establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of such establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented establishments such as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such establishments 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented establishments including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b nona nonb amebiasis salmonella and shigella infections 7 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of such facilities to selfregulate such activities and maintain such facilities 8 the findings noted in subsections b17 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 9 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of such reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented establishments further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators of such establishments to ensure that the sexually oriented establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented establishment and is fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring in such establishment 10 requiring licensees of sexually oriented establishments to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 11 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented establishment where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 12 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 13 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexuallyrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in such conduct in contravention of this article 14 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases  9162008   definitions the

violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses  and most sexual offenders commit many offenses have many more victims than are ever reported and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large while incalculable clearly exorbitant 2 it is the intent of this ordinance to serve the citys compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from loitering or establishing temporary or permanent residence 3 this chapter is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the city from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences the city finds and declares that repeat sexual offenders who use physical violence and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual offenders who present an extreme threat to the public safety and the health of children sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses  and most sexual offenders commit many offenses have many more victims than are ever reported and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes this makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large and the community where they reside while incalculable clearly exorbitant it is further believed that such persons present an alarmingly high risk of reoffending once released as such the city hereby establishes regulations which restrict certain offenders from residing or congregating in areas that are at or near where there is a high concentration of children in order to provide better protection for children in the city by minimizing immediate access and proximity to children and thereby reducing opportunity and temptation for recidivism 4 it is not the intent of the city council to punish sex offenders but rather to serve the citys compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence due to the high rate of recidivism for sexual offenders and because reducing both opportunity and temptation would help minimize the risk of reoffense there is a compelling need to protect children where they congregate or

development has significant adverse impacts on water resources and the health safety property and general welfare of the community and can diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically stormwater runoff can a carry sediment nutrients pathogens organic matter heavy metals toxins and other pollutants to regional lakes streams and wetlands  b diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and water supply uses and a natural diversity of plant and animal life  c clog existing drainage systems increasing maintenance problems and costs  d cause bank and channel erosion  e increase downstream flooding  f reduce groundwater recharge which may diminish stream base flows and lower water levels in regional lakes ponds and wetlands  g contaminate drinking water supplies  h increase risk of property damage and personal injury and  i cause damage to agricultural fields and crops 2 that effective sediment and stormwater management depends on proper planning design and timely installation of conservation and management practices and their continuing maintenance 3 recent developments in stormwater management practices suggest a need to incorporate current practices into the citys stormwater management ordinance b purpose 1 it is the purpose of this chapter to set forth the minimum requirements for stormwater management that when incorporated

permitted intensity for nonresidential projects of development on any given site within the jurisdiction of this title see  the development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors including but not limited to 1 the area of the site  2 the proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources  3 the zoning districts in which the site is located  4 the development options the site is developed under  and 5 the uses considered for development b rationale this chapter regulates the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this title this chapter is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the city of sun prairie comprehensive plan see also this title many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility of site design options which in turn results in land use inefficiencies forced site planning andor the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources the approach employed by this chapter relying on maximum gross densities mgds and minimum green space ratios gsrs for residential development and minimum required landscape surface ratios lsrs in combination with maximum permitted floor area ratios fars for nonresidential development both in conjunction with a variety of development options available in every zoning district results in a very high degree of site design flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired community character and adopted community goals and objectives    how to use this chapter this chapter contains the standards which determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site prior to using the provisions of this chapter to determine the development potential of a given property the guidelines provided by a c should be reviewed this chapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners the description of the process addressing residential development in subsections a and b refers to the requirements of residential density standards the description of the process addressing nonresidential development in subsections a and b refers to the requirements of nonresidential intensity standards    required natural resources site evaluation a purpose an important goal of the city of sun prairie comprehensive plan is the protection of natural resources which are sensitive to disruption caused by development andor other land use activities these resources include floodplains wetlands waterways shorelands steep slopes woodlands hilltops and native prairies these resources are defined in  these resources serve important functions which are lost when these areas are subject to development andor other land use activities in the absence of correct mitigation approaches in many instances these functions cannot be provided by other natural or manmade features specific broad categories of such functions include the protection and enhancement of air surface water ground water and soil quality  habitat provision and diversification  aesthetic diversification  and buffering effects b mitigation in certain instances natural features can accommodate development andor other land use activities without a

implications related to the subject property particularly map 113 preferred future land use  map 124 functional classification of roads  map 131 preferred growth areas  and map 133 staged development plan for public facilities copies of the plan are available at the citys planning department complete plans are sold at cost summaries are free of charge from time to time this plan may be amended the citys planning department should be consulted regarding changes to the plan which may effect the subject property or its environs b check official map recommendations the citys official map should be checked for proposed capital facilities and dedication requirements including schools parks stormwater management facilities and street improvements which may affect the subject property the official map is on display at the citys planning and engineering departments from time to time this map may be amended the citys planning and engineering departments should be contacted regarding changes to the map which may effect the subject property or its environs 2 check the zoning of the subject property the potential amount and type of development any given site may contain is directly related to the zoning district in which the site is located the subject property should be identified on the citys official zoning map see  and the current zoning designation should be compared with the description of that district provided in the official zoning map is on display at the citys planning department from time to time the official zoning map may be amended the zoning administrator should be contacted regarding potential changes in the map which may effect the subject property or its environs 3 complete a natural resources site evaluation for the site the effect of protected natural resources on the development potential of the subject property should be evaluated all resources listed in required natural resources site evaluation should be identified on the subject property located on a map or air photo of the subject property and the total area of the property in acres covered by those resources known as required resource protection area rpa should be determined as should the gross site area gsa and the net developable area nda of the subject property c contains a worksheet to simplify these calculations the city planner should be contacted if assistance is desired in completing these calculations b for residential development for steps 1 3 see subsection a of this section a key to assist with the procedure described below 4 determine what types of dwelling units are permitted the table of uses  should be checked to determine which types of dwelling units are permitted within the zoning district present on or proposed for the subject property each dwelling unit listed in the table requires a particular minimum lot area mla which is given in square feet to the right of the dwelling unit name a complete description of each dwelling unit type and their detailed lot setback and development standards is presented in  identify the desired permitted development option the table of uses  should be checked to determine which types of development options are permitted within the zoning district present on or proposed for the subject property each development option listed in the table permits different dwelling unit types care should be taken to ensure that the selected development options permit the desired dwelling unit types see subsection b4 of this section each development option is described in detail in the selection of a particular development option may be related to the preponderance of sensitive natural resource areas on the site or may reflect current or projected residential market conditions and the dwelling unit types they call for after the desired permitted development option is identified residential density standards should be referred to for a detailed listing of requirements for the selected development option in the identified zoning districts 6 check minimum site area requirement against gross site area present on the subject property the required minimum site area msa given in residential density standards for the development option selected in 5 and in the zoning district identified in 2 should be compared with the gross site area gsa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in step 3 in subsection a of this section if the gsa is less than the msa required by the selected development option then a development option requiring a lower degree of clustering must be selected to reduce the required msa or additional property should be acquired in other words the gsa from 3 must be equal to or greater than the msa from 5 7 check green space ratio requirement against required resource protection area present on the subject property the required green space ratio gsr given in residential density standards for the development option selected in 5 and in the zoning district identified in 2 should be multiplied by the gross site area gsa used in step 6 above the resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space this area should be compared with the required resource protection area rpa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in step 3 in subsection a of this section if the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected green space required in the selected development option then a development option requiring a higher degree of clustering may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential of the site in other words if the rpa from 3 is greater than the area required by the gsr from 5 a more clustered development option may permit the development of more dwelling units on the subject property 8 determine maximum gross density permitted on the site the maximum gross density mgd given in residential density standards for the development option selected in 5 and the zoning district identified in 2 above should be noted this number will be used in step 9 below 9 determine the maximum number of units permitted on the site the maximum gross density mgd identified in 8 above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in step 3 above equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the subject property under the selected development option within the selected zoning district the ability to actually develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not guaranteed by the provisions of this title inefficient site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a lower number of units actually fitting on the site 10 check the minimum permitted lot area against table  the minimum lot area mla requirement given in residential density standards is the smallest size lot permitted within the selected development option within the selected zoning district the mla must equal or be less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit proposed for the project in step 4 above if the mla given in larger than the lot size requirement given in step 4 then a dwelling unit type with a larger lot size must be selected in which case it may be advantageous to repeat steps 4 10 using a different dwelling unit type and a different development option rationale each residential zoning district permits a slight variation in maximum gross density mgd depending upon the type of development option used as the minimum required green space ratio gsr increases within each zoning district based on the development option selected the mgd increases this density incentive is based on two principles first the combinations of mgd and gsr requirements for the various development options permitted within each zoning district are designed to result in a consistent community character of development within that district  second the density incentive is designed to at least partially compensate for potential perunit price reductions associated with smaller lot sizes in developments providing significant amounts of required green space the minimum lot area mla requirements for each development option within each zoning district are used to ensure that a consistency of neighborhood character within each development option is maintained and that maximum permitted gross densities are approachable if not completely attainable under efficient site design practices finally the minimum site area msa requirements ensure that development within any given zoning district maintains a homogeneous appearance c nonresidential development for steps 1 3 see subsection a of this section a key to assist with the procedure described below 4 determine what types of land uses are permitted the second and third pages of the table of uses  should be checked to determine which types of land uses are permitted within the zoning district present on or proposed for the subject property a complete description of each land use is presented in  5 identify the desired development option number of floors nonresidential intensity standards presents a detailed listing of the development options available for nonresidential development in each zoning district each development option is based on a particular combination of maximum number of floors #f minimum landscape surface ratio lsr and maximum floor area ratio far the selection of a particular development option may be related to the presence of sensitive natural resource areas on the site or may reflect current or projected nonresidential market conditions and the types of buildings they call for 6 check minimum lot area requirement against gross site area present on the subject property the required minimum lot area mla given in nonresidential intensity standards for the development option selected in 5 and in the zoning district identified in 2 should be compared with the gross site area gsa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in step 3 above if the gsa is less than the mla required by the selected development option then additional property should be acquired in other words the gsa from 3 must be greater than or equal to the mla from 5 7 check minimum landscape surface ratio requirement against the required resource protection area present on the subject property the required landscape surface ratio lsr given in nonresidential intensity standards for the development option selected in 5 and in the zoning district identified in 2 should be multiplied by the gross site area gsa used in step 6 above the resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space this area should be compared with the required resource protection area rpa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in step 3 of subsection a of this section if the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required in the selected development option then a development option requiring more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the site in other words if the rpa from 3 is greater than the lsr from 5 a taller development option may permit the development of more floor area on the subject property 8 determine maximum floor area ratio permitted on the site the maximum floor area ratio far given in nonresidential intensity standards for the development option selected in 5 and the zoning district identified in 2 of subsection a of this section should be noted this number will be used in step 9 below 9 determine the maximum floor area permitted on the site the maximum floor area ratio far identified in 8 above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in step 3 above equals the maximum square footage of gross floor area permitted on the subject property under that development option within that zoning district the ability to actually develop this amount of floor area is not guaranteed by the provisions of this title inefficient site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a smaller amount of area actually fitting on the site 10 check the maximum building size requirement nc district the maximum building size mbs requirement given in nonresidential intensity standards is the largest size building permitted within the selected development option within the neighborhood commercial nc district the mbs must equal or be greater than the building size proposed for the project in step 9 above if the mbs given in smaller than the proposed building size calculated in step 9 above then a smaller building must be built or the use of additional buildings should be considered rationale each nonresidential zoning district permits a slight variation in maximum floor area ratio far depending upon the type of development option used as the minimum required landscape surface ratio lsr increases within each zoning district based on the development option selected the far increases this intensity incentive is based on two principles first the combinations of far and lsr requirements for the various development options within each zoning district are designed to result in a consistent community character of development within that district  second the intensity incentive is designed to compensate for potential per square foot price reductions associated with smaller fars in developments providing significant amounts of required green space the minimum lot area mla requirements for each development option within each zoning district are used to ensure that a consistency of neighborhood character within each development option is maintained and that maximum permitted floor area ratios fars are approachable if not completely attainable under efficient site design practices finally the maximum building size mbs requirements ensure that development within the neighborhood commercial nc district retains a neighborhood function and maintains a scale which is compatible with nearby residential development    nonconforming development regulations a variance for any and all requirements of this chapter is automatically granted to all developments in their configuration existing or as finally approved as of the effective date of this title however after the effective date of this title such developments shall not be permitted to enlarge expand or extend without bringing the enlargement expansion or extension into compliance with the provisions of this chapter and unless a variance is granted by the board of zoning appeals per the requirements of rationale the blanket variance provision of this section is intended to prevent the creation of certain nonconforming developments within the jurisdiction of this title the adoption of the provisions of this section ensures that developments approved prior to the adoption of this title do not encounter difficulty in transferring ownership because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming  bulk regulations purpose the purpose of this chapter is to indicate the requirements for building location and bulk in both residential and nonresidential developments the provisions of this chapter interact closely with the provisions of density and intensity regulations    how to use this chapter this chapter contains the standards which determine the location and height of buildings on any given site prior to using the provisions of this chapter to determine the potential layout of a given project the recommendations provided below should be reviewed this chapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential projects and thus

situations the bulk standards minimum lot area requirements or minimum lot dimension requirements may be reduced provided the zoning administrator determines that the following standards are being met 1 the lot adjustment does not result in the creation of additional lots nor will it facilitate the creation of additional dwelling units 2 as a result of the adjustment adequate area will be maintained on the lot to allow for maintenance and upkeep of all structures on the lot and to meet the uniform building the proposed lot pattern would be consistent with the lot pattern established for other singlefamily andor twofamily uses within the neighborhood 4 the reduction in the bulk standards being proposed is determined to be the minimum necessary to facilitate the proposed adjustment in the event that a special use permit is granted per this section the lot adjustment shall be accomplished by certified survey map or subdivision plat rationale many of the lots that predate the current zoning ordinance particularly in the older portions of the city do not meet the current bulk standards minimum lot area and minimum lot dimension requirements since these areas of the city were developed decades before the current standards were adopted it is difficult to meet the more suburban lot standards contained in the current ordinance the result has been a significant loss of flexibility for owners of homes in the citys older neighborhoods who wish to make a minor adjustment to their lot to reflect changing circumstances or desires for the property even when such adjustments would result in lots that are still substantially consistent with the overall pattern of development within the neighborhood this process was conceived to allow for city staff to review proposals for lot adjustments and approve such adjustments provided that certain standards are met and no negative impacts are anticipated as a result of the lot adjustment  8152006  prior code  13610

of this chapter is to set forth the requirements for the mandatory protection of natural and historic resources and permanently protected green space areas within the jurisdiction of this title see  the provisions of this chapter interact closely with the provisions of uses permitted in other permanently protected green space areas natural resource disruption and required mitigation standards required natural resources site evaluation and which provide residential and nonresidential development standards including minimum required green space ratios gsrs and minimum required landscape surface ratios lsrs a complete overview of the interrelationship between the abovelisted sections in part the provisions of this chapter are designed to ensure the implementation of the city of sun prairie comprehensive plan the environmental protection element of the dane county regional development guide and 237em and 8730 wisconsin statutes    how to use this chapter this chapter contains the standards which govern the protection disturbance and mitigation of disruption of all natural and historic resources and other permanently protected green space areas the provisions of this chapter are intended to supplement those of the city of sun prairie dane county the state of wisconsin and the federal government of the united states which pertain to natural resource protection prior to using the provisions of this chapter to determine the permitted disruption of such areas the requirements provided below should be reviewed this chapter recognizes the important and diverse benefits which natural and historic resource features provide in terms of protecting the health safety and general welfare of the community each of the following sections is oriented to each natural resource type and is designed to accomplish several objectives a first a definition of the natural or historic resource is provided  b second the specific purposes of the protective regulations governing each natural or historic resource type are provided  c third the required method of identifying and determining the boundaries of the natural or historic resource area is given  d fourth mandatory protection requirements are identified note protection requirements for specific land uses and natural resource types designed to minimize disruption of natural resource functions are presented in    environmental corridors a definition environmental corridors are continuous systems of open space in urban and urbanizing areas that include environmentally sensitive lands and natural resources requiring protection from disturbance and development and lands needed for open space and recreational use they are based mainly on drainageways and stream channels floodplains wetlands steep slopes and other resource features and are part of a countywide system of continuous open space corridors buffer zones for each environmental resource as defined in this section are considered a part of that specific resource environmental corridor b purpose of environmental corridor protection requirements the objective is to delineate in local and regional plans those lands and resources which perform important environmental functions and need to be protected from development and urbanization protection of these corridors in the community helps the city to protect lands needed for drainage and recreation  avoid problems from development on steep slopes problem soils or floodprone areas  protect water resources and avoid pollution  and enhance scenic beauty and wildlife habitat once delineated and adopted the corridors are used by the city and state and federal agencies in making decisions on the location of urban development and major facilities the corridors are also used as a basis or starting point for open space and recreation planning and acquisition an important use of the corridors is in rpcdnr review of sewer extensions and sewer service areas to direct urban development to areas outside the corridors c determination of environmental corridor boundaries general environmental corridor boundaries are depicted on sheet 2 of the official zoning map the dane county regional planning commission staff has worked with local units of government in dane county to delineate the corridors based on available information and mapping of environmental resources and open space lands water bodies and drainageways floodplains wetlands steep slopes woodlands areas of unique vegetation or geology existing and proposed parks etc all environmental corridors within urban service areas countywide have been mapped upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains an environmental corridor depicted on the official zoning map the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of this analysis shall depict the location of all environmental corridor areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of subsection a of this section d mandatory environmental corridor protection requirements environmental corridors shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in the specific permanently protected green space type and per the requirements of  buffer zone a buffer zone is a vegetative strip of land adjacent to a stream lake or wetland which serves as a protection for that water resource buffers moderate flow rates of stormwater runoff into receiving waters stabilize banks and shorelines filter nutrients and sediments from runoff support fish habitat provide habitat for other wildlife and screen aesthetically unappealing land uses buffers can also serve to moderate stream temperatures critical for some fish species such as trout buffer zones are established in this ordinance for wetlands perennial streams intermittent streams or open drainageways and lakes as shown on sheet 2 of the official zoning map 2 required minimum buffer zone widths for applicable environmental resources are listed in table  d2 below table  d2 minimum buffer zone widths environmental resource minimum buffer zone width wetland shoreland or inland 75 feet from wetland edge perennial or intermittent streams open channels or drainageways that are classified as navigable streams by the dnr 75 feet from the ordinary high water mark perennial or intermittent streams open channels or drainageways that are classified as nonnavigable streams by the dnr 75 feet centered on the stream shoreland lake and other water bodies 75 feet from the ordinary high water mark

planted with a minimum amount of landscaping b for every one acre of reforestation area required under the provisions of this title ten 10 plant units of alternative a b or d as described in  shall be provided in addition adequate ground cover shall be provided to stabilize the soil rationale the provisions of this section are designed to ensure that reforestation efforts required as part of woodland disruption mitigation standards result in the thorough and reasonably rapid replacement of the important and varied environmental functions which woodlands provide see     landscaping requirements for bufferyards a purpose this section provides the landscaping and width requirements for bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this title see  a bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier it includes an area together with the combination of plantings berms and fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances these nuisances can occur between adjacent zoning districts and between different development options within the same zoning district such nuisances are dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and incompatible land uses buildings or parking areas rationale one of zonings most important functions is the separation of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses the location of districts is supposed to provide protection but in the city this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as singlefamily residential and industrial uses were located next to one another long before the effective date of this title bufferyards will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses b required locations for bufferyards bufferyards shall be located along and within the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts or two different development options within the same zoning district abut one another bufferyards may be located in required setback areas bufferyards shall also be required adjacent to rightsofway wherever a zoning district or development option boundary is located within such rightofway in such instances the onehalf of the bufferyard requirements of this section shall be used instead of the street frontage landscaping required in if such requirements of this section are greater in such instances the width of the rightofway may be counted as contributing to the width requirements for a bufferyard however the minimum width required along the street frontage by shall be provided in all cases bufferyard plantings or structures shall not be located on any portion of any existing dedicated or officially mapped rightofway c determination of required bufferyard the determination of bufferyard requirements is a twostaged process first the required level of bufferyard opacity is determined using table d1 opacity is a quantitativelyderived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property the required level of opacity indicated by this table is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts andor development options the provisions of this subsection indicate the minimum requirements for bufferyards located along zoning district and development option boundaries 1 identification of required level of opacity table d1 shall be used to determine the minimum level of opacity for the required bufferyard the required level of opacity is determined by the value given in the cell of the table at which the column heading along the top row of the table representing the subject propertys zoning district and development option intersects with the row heading along the left hand side of the table representing the adjacent propertys zoning district and development option the value listed is the required level of opacity for the bufferyard on the subject property 2 identification of detailed bufferyard requirements table d2 shall be used to select the minimum levels of bufferyard width landscaping berming and fencing needed to achieve the minimum level of opacity from table d1 for the required bufferyard the landscaping component of each option is given in plant units as described in  for any given bufferyard any combination of options for the same level of opacity may be used this approach provides a very broad range of choice for bufferyard width landscaping berming and fencing which can be varied according to site features a if a proposed use adjoins a parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the presence of a zoning or development option boundary that use shall provide a bufferyard with the level of the opacity indicated in table d1 b for each level of opacity listed in table d1 a wide variety of width plant unit berm and structure combinations are possible these are listed in table d2 the requirements listed in table d2 pertain to the number of plant units the minimum bufferyard width and the type of berm or fencing required within every one hundred 100 feet of required bufferyard a variety of plant unit options are available and may be mixed within distinct portions of the same bufferyard the various available plant unit alternatives a listing of tree and shrub species which correspond to the plant unit descriptions d tables for required bufferyards see tables d1 and 2 notes for table d1   hg for properties zoned in the rural holding district rh35ac refer to the comprehensive plans preferred future land use map map 113 to determine the proposed zoning district for such property bufferyard requirements shall be taken from this proposal refer to exceptions to landscaping requirements for bufferyards for nonresidential uses in the urban residential ur12 zoning district caution the required opacity levels listed in table d1 are generally different on either side of any given zoning district or development option boundary care should be taken to properly use this table per subsection c1 to determine the subject propertys requirement

formal finding of fact on the part of the city of sun prairie plan commission and city council that the prohibition of offpremises advertising signage furthers two compelling government interests 1 the general public interest of reducing visual clutter caused by offpremises advertising signage which the city has determined is a significant cause of unsafe traffic conditions  and 2 the public interest served by furthering the implementation of the purposes of this title and the city of sun prairie comprehensive plan in terms of limiting the further spread of strip commercial development of which offpremises advertising signs are a primary contributor furthermore the city advocates that this regulation leaves ample and adequate alternative channels of commercial speech communication for the messages portrayable on such offpremises advertising signs namely distributed print media broadcast media and pointofpurchase display and is narrowly defined so as to limit such prohibition to commercial speech on exterior signage 1 billboard replacement program an owner of a legally nonconforming billboard sign existing upon the effective date of this chapter may apply for a conditional

consideration the standards for review presented in subsection e of this section 3 third a staff report shall be forwarded to the petitioner indicating the interpretation of the zoning administrator e standards for review of requested interpretations this title shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the city of sun prairie city council as noted in this title and the comprehensive plan the intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this title is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed modified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this title shall proceed as follows 1 articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation is required rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit discussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated 2 articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public rationale there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the title design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this title is to be prohibited 3 determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal rationale if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party either the adjoining landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this title similarly any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this title any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this title has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements and power to the public exercise this in order protect the public 4 this title has been carefully designed by the city council to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan for the city great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options persons interpreting this title should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the city council 5 in addition to the petitioners response to the questions required by subsection c of this section the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters a no interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the city council on an application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation b no interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right a special use or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in the zoning district of the subject property see  c no interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject propertys zoning district see  d no interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in such district or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category see  e if the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject propertys district than to a use permitted by right then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to f effect of a favorable land use interpretation no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development construction reconstruction alteration or moving of any building or structure a favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation filing and processing of applications for any permits and
