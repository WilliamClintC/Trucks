promote the health cleanliness comfort and safety of the citizens of concord township and to regulate the time of opening and closing and the conduct of places of public entertainment amusement and recreation the township of concord enacts this article to minimize and control the adverse effects of adult entertainment businesses and thereby to protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens protect the citizens from increased crime preserve the quality of life preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of blight b the board of supervisors has determined that locational criteria alone does not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of the township and that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation c the board of supervisors does not intend this article to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a contentneutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses a and it adopts by reference the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses presented in hearings and in reports and adopted as part of township enacted 26 b that the finding noted in above raises substantial governmental concerns c that adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns d that a reasonable licensing procedure is an

incentive on the operators to see that the adult entertainment business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein e that the removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters f that requiring licensees of adult entertainment businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments g that the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the adult entertainment business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases h that it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity i that the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this article j that the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases k that the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the township will be promoted by the enactment of this article a the defined terms in

drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn  according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts  sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part
