offers examples of other small new england towns the town of west greenwich has an expectation that new development will be of high quality in design and will lend a pleasing visual element to our built environment 2 commercialretailofficerestaurants a these types of businesses are the most visible to the community and tend to have the greatest visual impact to the public streetscape and also
