construed in that in order to be considered as direct line all titles must have the same generic root b next lower occupied title shall mean the title in direct line of promotion immediately below the title from which the incumbent is suspended or demoted unless no one is serving in that title in that layoff unit in which case it shall be the closest lower title in direct line of promotion in that layoff unit in which one or more persons do serve c layoff unit shall mean the white plains housing authority the white plains parking authority the white plains school district and each department of the city d satisfactory service shall mean service by an employee during which he did not receive an unsatisfactory performance rating and was not found guilty of misconduct or incompetency pursuant to section 75 of the civil service law which resulted in the imposition of any of the following penalties upon such employee 1 dismissal from the service or 2 suspension without pay for a period exceeding one month or 3 demotion in grade and title e 1 permanent service shall start on that date of the incumbents original appointment on a permanent basis in the classified service  however in the case of disabled veterans the date of original permanent appointment is considered to be sixty 60 months earlier than the actual date while nondisabled veterans are considered to have been appointed thirty 30 months earlier than their actual date of appointment for the purposes of this rule the definition of what constitutes a veteran or disabled veteran is contained in section 85 of the civil service law 2 a resignation followed by a reinstatement or reappointment more than one year subsequent to the resignation constitutes a break in service the original appointment date is to be determined from the date of reemployment  the prior service would not count 3 temporary or provisional service preceding the original permanent appointment does not count however temporary or provisional employment immediately preceded and followed by permanent classified service employment does not interrupt continuous service 4 the permanent service of an employee who was transferred from another civil division shall start on the date of his original permanent appointment in the classified service in the other civil division 5 if an employee was coveredin to a classified position upon acquisition by a civil division of an agency in which he was employed his seniority begins on the effective date of the coverin as between that employee and others coveredin on the same date they shall have the seniority held by them as among themselves in the agency before the coverin 2 suspension a when an occupied position in the competitive class is abolished suspension is to be made from among those employees holding the same title in the same layoff unit as the abolished position b among permanent employees the order of suspension is the inverse of the order of their original permanent appointments in the classified service see above definition of permanent service for veterans and disabled veterans an exception to this rule is that the blind have absolute retention rights but only in their job status c a blind person may not backdate his permanent service if he also happens to be either a veteran or disabled veteran d a person is considered blind if he is so certified by the commission for the visually handicapped of the new york state social services department e when two or more permanent incumbents of positions in a specific title are suspended demoted or displaced at the same time the order in which they shall be entitled to displace shall be determined by their respective retention standing with those having the greater retention standing entitled to displace first f when several employees were originally appointed on a permanent basis on the same day their retention rights shall be determined by their rank on the eligible list from which they were appointed that person having the highest rank having greater retention rights over those having lower ranks g all temporary provisional and contingent permanent employees occupying these positions must be let go before any permanent employee is suspended from such positions h probationary employees occupying such positions in the same title must also be suspended before any permanent employee in the layoff unit in that title who has completed his probationary period probationary employees do however have superior retention rights to those of contingent permanent temporary and provisional employees i the order of suspension among probationary employees shall follow the same principles as that among permanent employees 3 vertical bumping a vertical bumping occurs when an employee in a specific title to which there is a direct line of promotion who is himself suspended or displaced displaces an employee in the next lower occupied title in direct line of promotion in the same layoff unit having the least seniority if the employee who seeks to displace has greater retention standing b where the layoff involves more than one position in a title the order of displacement will be the inverse of the order of suspension that is the most senior of the suspended employees will be the first to displace this shall apply to both vertical bumping and retreat c if an employee refuses to displace a junior incumbent he must be laid off this however does not protect the junior incumbent from being compared in retention standing with other incumbents if other positions at the higher level are being abolished d when a next lower title has been occupied by means of displacement regardless of when the displacement into the title has occurred it is considered to be occupied for further displacement purposes  however a next lower title which has all of its positions abolished at the same time as positions are abolished at the higher level cannot be considered as occupied a title which is occupied by an incumbent temporary provisional contingent permanent probationary or permanent is considered occupied for the purposes of this section 4 retreat a retreat occurs when and only when there is no lower occupied position in direct line of promotion at any level b an employee may retreat by displacing the incumbent with the least retention right who is serving in a position in the title in which the displacing incumbent last served on a permanent basis prior to service in the title from which he is currently suspended or displaced retreat may only occur where the position in the title formerly held by the displacing incumbent is occupied in the competitive class in the same layoff unit and at a lower salary grade  the service of the displacing incumbent while in the former title must have been satisfactory and the junior incumbent must have less retention standing than the displacing incumbent c the service of the displacing incumbent in the title to which he is retreating need not have been in the same layoff unit as the one from which he is displaced d an employee may also displace by retreat to a position in a title he last served on a permanent basis although he had intervening service in other titles as long as his service in each of the intervening titles was on other than a permanent basis he may also displace by retreat to a position which does not count in the computation of his continuous service e where a title change has been effected to better describe the duties of a position but the duties have not substantially changed since the suspended employee last served in that title the new title will for retreat purposes be deemed to be the former title 5 an employee who refuses to accept an appointment afforded by displacement for whatever reason waives all rights regarding the displacement  however this employees name will be entered on an appropriate preferred list 6 preferred list standing for competitive class employees on and after  shall be as follows a on and after  those employees whose positions were abolished prior to that date and who therefore had their standing on the preferred list determined by the date of their original appointment on a permanent basis in the competitive class shall retain among themselves such preferred list standing including the preferences to which they were entitled as blind disabled veterans and nondisabled veterans b blind employees whose positions are abolished on or after  shall have their preferred list standing determined by the date of their original appointment on a permanent basis in the classified service whether or not they are also disabled veterans or nondisabled veterans  provided however that the blind shall be granted absolute preference on the preferred list over all other employees except those disabled veterans and blind employees whose positions were abolished prior to  with whose names theirs shall be interfiled c disabled veterans whose positions are abolished on or after  shall have their preferred list standing determined by the date of their original appointment on a permanent basis in the classified service  provided however that the date of such original appointment shall be deemed to be sixty 60 months earlier than the actual date determined in accordance with section 30 of the general construction law d nondisabled veterans whose positions are abolished on or after  shall have their preferred list standing determined by the date of their original appointment on a permanent basis in the classified service  provided however that the date of such original appointment shall be deemed to be thirty 30 months earlier than the actual date determined in accordance with section 30 of the general construction law e nonveterans whose positions are abolished on or after  shall have their preferred list standing determined by the date of their original appointment on a permanent basis in the classified service f the names of all persons encompassed by paragraphs c d and e above whose positions are abolished on or after  shall be interfiled on the preferred list with the names of all nonveterans whose positions were abolished prior to  7 an appointing authority may take such steps as it may deem necessary in order to secure binding written commitments in advance of

department of environmental conservation nysdec that a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of storm water management practices can increase the velocity of storm water runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the city of white plains and the state  g storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of storm water runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety  i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing storm water management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development  1 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum storm water management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within the city and to address the states findings of fact in section 361 hereof this chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives a meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of new york states spdes general permit for storm water

despite the prohibition in the existing zoning ordinance prohibiting and restricting the parking of commercial vehicles in residentially zoned areas there has been a tendency to violate the ordinance arising out of hardship by many citizens who employ auto trucks or light delivery cars to go to and from their employment or place of business and their residences the standing of such commercial vehicles in residential zones tends to deteriorate the quality of living in such zones by the ugliness of most commercial vehicles  by the creation of hazards by reason of the types of material carried in such commercial vehicles  by the increase in hazards to neighbors by reason of the increased traffic of heavy vehicles in the neighborhood as compared to the lighter weight passenger vehicles normally considered to use the roads and driveways of such residential neighborhoods  by generation of violations of the building code and aspects of the zoning ordinance by reason of the placement of commercial vehicles in garages not designed for the housing of such vehicles and which were intended by the zoning ordinance to house only private vehicles  by generating disobedience to the provisions for the protection of the health safety and welfare of the community at large of the protections intended by the zoning ordinance and building code for the community b concurrently with the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived the common council liberalized but carefully controlled the conditions under which such commercial type vehicles may be garaged in a residentially zoned area in a private garage and found it necessary to require that the vehicle intended to be used in such private garage in a residential zone shall be carefully regulated by means of an annual inspection of the vehicle to determine that the vehicle is of the appropriate size and is equipped as to the essential safety devices necessary to protect the community when such vehicles are permitted in such zones the amount of the license fee adopted in this chapter is intended to offset the expected costs of annual registration and inspection and identification of the vehicles so

purchases and uninformed program choices if certain procedural and operational safeguards are not maintained b should an mcs provider implement andor offer menudriven programservice selection for all
