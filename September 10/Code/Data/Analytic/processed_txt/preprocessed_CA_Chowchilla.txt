account there is established a storm drainage enterprise account to be kept separate and apart from the general fund of the city or any other special account of the city all storm drainage fees collected pursuant to this chapter by the city shall be deposited into the enterprise account all costs the payment of which were used to calculate the amount of the storm drainage fee shall be paid out of the storm drainage enterprise account the storm drainage enterprise account funds shall not be used to pay any costs other than the costs which are directly related to the city providing storm drainage services as described in this chapter  part 1995   storm drainage feespurpose and amount there is established a storm drainage fee the amount of the fee shall be established by the city council and modified from time to time thereafter by resolution the amount of the fee shall be determined by the council based on the councils findings of the actual cost of providing stormwater drainage services to properties within the city a the calculation of the actual cost may include but is not necessarily limited to the cost of each of the following the construction of any storm drainage ponding basins constructed by the city including but not limited to the debt service payment for any debt incurred for this purpose  the cost of the maintenance of any storm drainage ponding basin which the city owns and operates and into which stormwater drains from property within the city limits  the cost of the construction acquisition operation and maintenance of any and all other storm drainage facilities including but not limited to any administrative master planning engineering and design work associated with them and the cost of any appurtenances to such facilities such as drains ditches pipes pumps gutters and fencing and landscaping in along over or within any storm drainage basins owned operated or maintained by the city b the method of determining charges shall take into account the square footage of the property and the allowable use of the land because use indicates the likely percentage of surface area of the land available for the percolation of stormwaters  part 1995   storm drainage feeswhen payable the city shall cause the owner of each developed property within the city which is not exempt from this charge periodically to be sent a statement for storm drainage fees and collection of those fees shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of of this code however storm drainage services cannot be terminated by a property owner unless and until that property owner either ceases to own the property or brings that property within one or more of the exemptions to the storm drainage fee set forth in this chapter  part 1995   exemptions it is not fair or reasonable for certain types of properties to be billed for the stormwater fee and it is found and determined that those properties should be exempt from the fee a because industrial or manufacturing properties in the city which are zoned for heavy industrial use under of this code are required to construct and maintain their own storm drainage facilities and to dispose of all storm drainage waters which run off of their own property thereby this fee is specifically made inapplicable to properties which are zoned for such purposes however property which is zoned for light industrial use under of this code is not required to construct or maintain their own storm drainage facilities or to dispose of all storm drainage waters which run off of their own property and therefore such property is not exempt from the fee charged pursuant to this chapter b because certain land from time to time has been and will be annexed into the city which is in an agricultural use and if allowed to remain in that use after annexation then all land in agricultural uses and which is appropriately zoned for such purpose is specifically excluded from the applicability of this chapter c because land which has never been developed typically is not paved and does not have upon it any building or structure which is impenetrable to water such land as a general rule does not cause stormwater run off but in fact serves to help provide open land in which stormwaters may gather and percolate into the ground such land is specifically excluded from the applicability of this chapter d because the owner of a single parcel of land should not be compelled to pay twice for the same services all land which is in a landscape and lighting maintenance district of the city for any fiscal year in which the landscape and lighting maintenance district has established its budget so as to include the cost of operating and maintaining storm drainage collection retention or disposal facilities is specifically excluded from the applicability of this chapter however such exemption shall cease at the beginning of any fiscal year in which the budget adopted for the landscape and lighting maintenance district does not include the full cost of maintaining the stormwater facilities which serve the property within that district e because land owned by the city would simply pay the fee out of the enterprise fund itself it would make no sense for the city to have to pay itself such a fee therefore all land owned by the city is exempt from the payment of the fee  part 1995

the owners at the time of the application for a building permit are the current owners of the property   2att a 12112018   findings a the purpose of the fees set forth in this chapter is to reimburse the city for the costs of constructing certain public improvements including but not limited to streets including but not necessarily limited to street paving sidewalks and street lights sewer mains water mains storm water drainage and other related improvements in the realignment of the southern intersection of chowchilla boulevard and robertson boulevard a fair and just cost distribution between the benefitted properties for each of these improvements would be to base the distribution upon net acreage of each of the properties b such fees shall be used to reimburse the citys enterprise funds capital accounts for the cost incurred by the city in constructing the public improvements and shall be used by the city in conformity with the limitations placed upon those accounts c there is a reasonable relationship between the purpose of these fees and the benefitted properties because the benefitted properties will benefit from the public improvements and the development of the benefitted properties would necessitate the construction of these public improvements at that time d the size of the fees shall be determined by the council by resolution no such fee shall be set

properties shall be assessed for a proportional share of the costs to the city of constructing the public improvements the proportion shall be determined by the council by resolution but shall be based on the level of benefit which the council determines is applicable to that parcel of benefitted property compared to the level of benefit received by the other benefitted properties the council may determine that each of the parcels are benefitted equally from the public improvements in which case the fraction shall be one divided by the total number of properties which are determined to be

approval to reflect changes in the project costs of construction once determined the actual cost of construction of these improvements adjusted for inflation shall be used b the formula for the determination of the amount of these fees for each parcel based upon net acreage would be to apply the percentage set forth in the following tables to the cost of the improvements identified 1 for

subject the applicant to the fees or other exactions which the council requires at the time of the application for a renewal of the approval if an approval or a renewal expires due to the passage of time and the original applicant does not choose to apply to renew the approval then upon request for a refund the applicants capacity fees shall be refunded to the applicant in which case upon the

the tax sharing agreement tax sharing agreement means the agreement between the city and the county of madera dated on or about  b the fees established by this chapter shall apply to an applicant for the annexation of any benefitted property   2att a 12112018   findings a the city is allowed by law to impose a sales tax of up to one percent of the gross sales which occur within the city and if the city imposes less than the one percent allowed by law the county of madera receives whatever portion of the one percent of gross sales which the city does not receive the city had up until the time of the tax sharing agreement imposed and collected the full one percent sales tax allowed by law and so the county of madera had received none of this one percent the local agency formation commission lafco determined that no annexation of land to the city could proceed without a tax sharing agreement between the city and the county the county would not enter into a tax sharing agreement with the city unless such agreement included a provision requiring the city to impose less than the one percent sales tax over the tenyear term of the tax sharing agreement b all properties which are annexed to the city from and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter are benefitted by the tax sharing agreement when those properties annex to the city and the owners of those benefitted properties should be required to participate in the reimbursement to the city of the costs incurred by the city described herein c the purpose of the fees set forth in this chapter is to reimburse the city for the costs of obtaining a tax sharing agreement with the county of madera a fair and just cost distribution between the benefitted properties for these costs is to base the distribution upon net acreage of each of the properties d such fees shall be used to reimburse the citys general fund for the cost incurred by the city in entering into said tax sharing agreement and shall be used by the city in conformity with the limitations placed upon that account e there is a reasonable relationship between the purpose of these fees and the benefitted properties because the benefitted properties will benefit from annexation to the city which could not have occurred but for the tax sharing agreement and the development of the benefitted properties within the city could not occur without such a tax sharing agreement f the size of the fees shall be determined by the council by resolution no such fee shall be set unless it is determined by the council to bear a

determining the amount of the fee   2att a 12112018   payment of and determination of amount of fees such fee shall be payable at the time of and as a condition of the city processing an application for annexation to the city each of the benefitted properties shall be assessed for a proportional share of the costs to the city of the tax sharing agreement the council hereby determines that the following formula shall be applied for this purpose a for all property other than property which is annexed for the purpose of being developed as affordable housing the amount of the fee shall be determined by determining the level of benefit to the property from the tax sharing agreement the level of benefit shall be expressed as a fraction which shall be the acreage of that particular benefitted property divided by the total acreage of all the benefitted properties which had annexed to the city between the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter including the benefitted property plus one thousand fifteen acres which is all the property located in the greenhills annexation b in order to determine the amount of the fees to be paid by this particular benefitted property that fraction shall then be multiplied by the projected loss in sales tax revenue to the city for the remaining term of the tax sharing agreement c residential property which is to be developed as affordable housing shall count as having no acreage 1 if a portion of the land to be annexed is to be used for an affordable housing project and a portion is to be used for some other purpose then only that land which is to be used for the other purpose shall be counted in determining that benefitted propertys fee 2 if after land is annexed into the city as property to be developed as affordable housing the property owner then applies for any development entitlements which are inconsistent with the affordable housing use indicated the property owner shall be required as a condition of the issuance of that development entitlement to pay all annexation fees which they would have had to pay but for the waiver based on the affordable housing use designation 3 for the purpose of interpreting this section the term development entitlements shall include each of the following tentative or final parcel map  tentative or final subdivision map  site plan  building permit  certificate of occupancy 4 once a property has been annexed into the city under the terms of this clause if it is then developed as and used as affordable housing for a period of ten years then any future development entitlements for that property would not require the payment of the waived annexation fees   2att a 12112018   amount of fees the fees set forth herein shall be adjusted from time to time but at least annually after a public hearing subject to council review and approval to reflect changes in the cost of the tax sharing agreement based upon the actual sales tax revenue received during the immediately preceding year the formula for the determination of the amount of these fees for each parcel based upon the fraction determined under the previous code section would be to multiply the fraction against the total amount of the cost of the tax sharing agreement projected for the balance of the life of the tax sharing agreement based on the actual sales tax revenue for the preceding year as determined by the council   2att a 12112018   disposition of development fees a pursuant to government there is hereby established a separate reserve account within the general fund

received by the city by virtue of the tax sharing agreement all moneys in the reserve account established by this chapter shall be held separate and apart from other city funds until the council determines otherwise for that year all interest or other earnings of each such reserve account shall be credited to that account b all moneys and interest in the reserve accounts established by this

between the need for the additional public facilities and the type of development for all the essential infrastructure the council is committed to maintaining the same level of public facilities and services and the same facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on the date of the most recent amendment of this chapter in order to ensure that to the extent that growth of the city occurs in the future there will be an adequate level of public facilities and services for park land the council determines pursuant to of the government to require new development to either dedicate land or pay fees in lieu thereof based on a minimum ratio of at least three acres of land per one thousand new residents of the city even though that ratio exceeds the actual ratio in existence at the time of the adoption of the ordinance establishing this new standard the council finds that a reasonable relationship exists between the need for additional public facilities equipment and operations which the fee is designed to pay and the type of development project for which the fee is imposed for the following reasons a the council has determined that commercial and industrial developments result in a need for additional public services which in turn ultimately result in a need for additional government and public facilities for essential infrastructure and related facilities based on the level of public services and public facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on the date of the adoption and amendment of this chapter and the extent to which commercial and industrial developments contribute to growth the council determines that commercial and industrial development should be assessed at rates to be established by resolution of the council as the fair share of contribution for the costs of these required facilities and services b the council has determined that residential development including new mobilehome park development results in significant increases in city population and that such residential development adversely affects the public facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on the date of the adoption and amendment of this chapter the council has further determined that because residential development results in significant increases in population such development results in the need for essential infrastructure and related facilities including but not limited to parks and recreation facilities based on the public facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on said date residential development shall be assessed at the rate established by resolution of the council for the costs for these required public facilities and services   2att a 12112018   adjustment of fee the fee set forth herein shall be adjusted from time to time but not less than annually subject to council review and approval after a noticed public hearing to reflect changes in costs as determined by the city administrator and department head level staff   2att a 12112018   relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of facilities attributable to the development upon which the fee is imposed the council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee set by resolution of the council and the cost of the public facilities or portions thereof attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed the basis for such determination is set out in reports to the council from the city administrator the director and the city engineer and such consultants as the council determines are necessary if any to develop accurate costs and fees to cover such costs   2att a 12112018   relationship between the use of the fee and the type of development upon which the fee is imposed the council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the fee for specified categories of public facilities and the type of development project for which the fee is imposed for the following reasons a the council finds that the use of fees generated from commercial and industrial development for parks and recreation facilities is not reasonable because the council determines that there is no substantial demand placed on such facilities as a result of commercial and industrial development the council finds further that the use of fees generated from commercial and industrial development for stormwater facilities is reasonable in instances where regional collection systems and drainage basins are planned however the use of fees generated from commercial and industrial development for stormwater facilities is not reasonable where no regional collection systems and basins are planned and the city has required such commercial and industrial development to provide for its own onsite disposal of site generated stormwater thereby substantially diverting its demand on the citys stormwater facilities as a result of such commercial and industrial development because commercial and industrial developments do increase demand on all other essential infrastructure and related facilities the council finds that the use of fees generated from commercial and industrial development for such facilities is reasonable and is supported by the city engineers applicable stormwater calculations and estimates based on site use b the council finds that the use of fees generated from residential development for all essential infrastructure and related facilities including but not limited to parks and recreations facilities and stormwater fees is reasonable

are subject to the policies and requirements of the madera countywide airport land use compatibility plan a use located in more than one of the following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation c the airport height zones are defined as follows 1 visual approach zone the inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide the approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of one thousand two hundred fifty feet at a horizontal distance of five thousand feet from the primary surface its center line is the continuation of the center line of the runway 2 nonprecision instrument approach zone the inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred feet wide the approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of two thousand feet at horizontal distance five thousand feet from the primary surface 3 transitional zones the transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces transition zones extend outward from a line one hundred feet on either side of the centerline of the runway for the length of such runway plus two hundred feet on each end the transition zones along such runway slope upward and outward one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the point where they intersect the surface of the horizontal zone further transition zones are established adjacent to approach zones for the entire length of the approach zones these transition zones have variable widths as shown on the zoning map such transition zones have variable widths as shown on the zoning map such transition zones flare symmetrically with either side of the runway approach zones from the base of such zones and slope upward and outward at the rate of one foot vertically for each seven feet horizontally to the points where they intersect the surfaces of the horizontal and conical zones 4 horizontal zone the horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of five thousand feet radii for runways designated as utility or visual from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs the horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones 5 conical zone the conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there from a horizontal distance of four thousand feet   2exh a 1092018   airport height limitations a no structure shall be

approved   2exh a 1092018   sign design principles a the following sign design principles should be used as criteria for review and approval of sign permits and master sign programs 1 architectural compatibility a sign including its supporting structure if any should be designed as an integral design element of a buildings architecture and be architecturally compatible including color and scale with any building to which the sign is to be attached and with surrounding structures a sign that covers a window or that spills over natural boundaries or architectural features and obliterates parts of upper floors of buildings is detrimental to visual order and will not be permitted common indicators of compatibility include quality sign design and construction proportional size and scale  and use of materials shapes and colors that complement the buildings architectural style and the surrounding environment 2 legibility the size and proportion of the elements of the signs message including logos letters icons and other graphic images should be selected based on the average distance and average travel speed of the viewer sign messages oriented towards pedestrians may be smaller than those oriented towards automobile drivers colors chosen for the sign text andor graphics should have sufficient contrast with the sign background in order to be easily read during both day and night symbols and logos can be used in place of words substantial contrast should be provided between the color and materials of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read 3 readability a sign message should be easily recognized and designed in a clear unambiguous and concise manner so that a viewer can understand or make sense of what appears on the sign 4 visibility a sign should be conspicuous and readily distinguishable from its surroundings so a viewer can easily see the information it communicates 5 placement often a buildings architectural details create logical places for signage signs should not cover or interrupt architectural details or ornaments of a buildings faade on buildings with a monolithic or plain faade signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm scale and proportion welldesigned and welllocated retail signs create visual interest and continuity with other storefronts on the same or adjacent buildings 6 materials signs shall be made of sturdy durable materials paper cardboard or other material subject to rapid deterioration can only be used for signs that comply with applicable requirements for temporary signs fabric signs are restricted to awnings canopies flags and temporary signs b sign permits or master sign programs that are determined by the director to be substantially inconsistent with these sign design principles may be denied   2exh a 1092018   rules for sign measurement a for the purposes of this chapter lot frontage shall be calculated as follows 1 if a lot fronts on two streets both frontages may be used to determine the allowable sign area 2 if a lot fronts on three or more streets the length of only two contiguous sides shall be added together to determine allowable sign area b the building frontage shall be the building facade in which main customer access is provided to the establishment a buildings frontage is considered continuous if projections or recesses in the building facade do not exceed fifteen feet in any direction for buildings with two or more frontages the length of the wall and allowable sign area shall be calculated separately for each building frontage c the area of an individual sign shall be calculated as follows 1 sign area shall include the entire area within a single continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles that enclose the extreme limits of all sign elements including but not limited to sign structures or borders written copy logos symbols illustrations and color supporting structures such as sign bases and columns are not included in sign area provided that they contain no lettering or graphics 2 where two faces of a doublefaced sign are located two feet or less from one another at all points or located at an interior angle of fortyfive degrees or less from one another the sign area shall be calculated as the area of one face where the two faces are not equal in size the larger sign face shall be used where two faces of a doublefaced sign are located more than two feet or fortyfive degrees from one another both sign faces shall be counted toward sign area 3 on a threefaced sign where at least one interior angle is fortyfive degrees or less the sign area shall be calculated as the sum of the largest and the smallest face in all other situations involving a sign with three or more sides sign area shall be calculated as the sum of all faces 4 threedimensional signs the size of signs that consist of or have attached to them one or more threedimensional objects ie balls cubes clusters of objects sculpture or statuelike trademarks shall be calculated as the sum of the square footage of the two adjacent sides of the smallest theoretical cube that would encompass the sign d the height of a sign shall be calculated as follows 1 the height of a sign that is not a freestanding sign shall be the vertical distance measured from the ground level directly beneath the sign to the highest point at the top of the sign including any structural or architectural components of the sign 2 the height of a freestanding sign shall be measured as the vertical distance from grade at the edge of the rightofway along which a freestanding sign is placed to the highest point of the freestanding sign including any structural or architectural components of the sign when the grade at the edge of the rightofway is higher than the site on which the sign is placed that portion of the sign below the grade at the edge of the rightofway shall not be included in determining the freestanding signs overall height freestanding signs oriented towards a freeway shall be measured from the sites finished grade or pad whichever is lower e sign clearance shall be measured as the smallest vertical distance between finished grade and the lowest point of the sign including any framework or other embellishments f for the purpose of determining the allowed number and size of signs an integrated
