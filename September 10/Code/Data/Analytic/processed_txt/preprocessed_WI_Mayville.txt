exception overlay district is established to provide a procedure to regulate structuralmodifications and additions within the district the special exception overlay district boundaries havebeen established by locating residential lots that were platted for the most part prior to the 1960s itwas common at that time to have lots 66 feet wide or less home construction often incorporated atwostory structure on a relatively narrow lot frequently without a garage as uses of these homes today often involve the need for additional garage space and otheradditions to the home itself property owners found that the limited lot area in the older areas ofthe city necessitated that variances be granted for many of their proposed projects in order to address these needs the special exception procedure will eliminate many of thevariance requests this process will incorporate flexibility into this chapter for the areas describedencourage neighborhoodsensitive decisions and encourage input from neighbors  editors note amended at time of adoption of see ch 1  general provisions art ii  this article is not to be used for the granting of exceptions to the permitted or
