aesthetic and hydrologic functions of the citys wetlands by regulating the use of wetlands and their adjacent properties these functions include but are not limited to sediment control pollution control filtration fish and wildlife habitat and aquifer recharge b the intent of this section is to protect wetlands to the maximum extent possible while allowing a reasonable use of the property this section adopts the regulations and standards of the wetland conservation act of 1991 wca laws of minnesota 199 chapter 354 as amended and the rules adopted pursuant to the wca it also establishes a wetland overlay district this overlay district further regulates the underlying land use as allowed by other districts or the wca 2 designation of protected wetlands and exemptions athe wetlands protected and regulated by this types 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 wetlands as defined in circular 39 wetlands of the united states 1971 edition united states department of the interior protected wetlands are further generally defined as follows type 1 seasonally flooded basins or floodplains type 1 wetlands are seasonally flooded basins or flats in which soil is covered with water or is waterlogged during variable seasonal periods but usually is welldrained during much of the growing season type 1 wetlands are located in depressions and in overflow bottom lands along water courses vegetation varies greatly according to the season and duration of the flooding and includes bottom land hardwoods as well as herbaceous plants type 2 inland fresh meadow occurs along the shallow edges of lakes marshes and floodplains or in perched depressions the soil is usually without standing water during much of the growing season but is waterlogged within at least a few inches of the surface vegetation includes grasses sedges rushes and various herbaceous plants type 3 inland shallow fresh marsh soil is usually water logged during the growing season often covered with as much as six inches or more of water vegetation includes grasses bulrushes cattails arrowheads smartweeds and other emergent aquatic vegetation type 4 inland deep fresh marsh soil covered with six inches to three feet or more of water during growing season vegetation includes cattails reeds bulrushes and wild rice open water areas may contain pondweeds naiads coontail water milfoils and other submergent aquatic vegetation type 5 inland open fresh water water is usually less than 10 feet deep and is fringed by a border of emergent vegetation vegetation includes pondweeds naiads coontail water milfoils and other submergent aquatic vegetation type 6 shrub swamp occurs along sluggish streams or on floodplains the soil is usually waterlogged during the growing season and is often covered with as much as six inches of water vegetation includes alder willow and dogwood type 7 wooded swamp occurs along sluggish streams on floodplains on flat perched depressions and in shallow lake basins the soil is waterlogged to within a few inches of its surface during the growing season and is often covered with as much as one foot of water vegetation typical to this wetland includes tamarack white cedar black spruce balsam fir red maple and black ash type 8 bog occurs along sluggish streams on flat perched depressions and shallow lake basins the soil is waterlogged and supports a spongy covering of mosses vegetation typical to this wetland type includes sphagnum moss heath shrubs and sedges minnesota bogs contain leatherleaf labrador tea cranberries and pitcher plants scattered stunted black spruce and tamarack also are common features of bogs bareas that exhibit wetland characteristics but were created for a purpose other than to create a wetland are exempt from this section this includes areas such as storm water ponds roadway ditches or other areas that receive artificial hydrology the landowner has the responsibility to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an area is exempt under this paragraph cthe reconstruction and maintenance of existing public roads and associated public utilities are exempt from this section 30023 as long as they comply with the wca as approved by city staff amended by adopted  3 boundaries of the wetland overlay districts this section establishes the presumptive wetland overlay districts these districts are subject to additional requirements beyond those required by the wca the boundaries of the presumptive wetland overlay districts are identified by government survey section and contour elevation above mean sea level in appendix a to this section the citys official wetland map graphically shows these boundaries if a specific wetland delineation has been done under wca rules then the boundaries of the wetland overlay district for that location will be as shown in the delineation rather than the presumptive boundaries the city may require wetland delineations to determine compliance with wca rules and this section 30023  however property owners may have wetland delineations done for their properties on their own initiative the delineation must be done by a professional wetland delineator according to wca rules and be acceptable to the city planner  public waters and public water wetlands are included in the overlay district 4 interpretation of wetlands boundaries whenever a delineated wetland boundary is disputed or uncertain the city planner or designee may convene the technical evaluation panel according to wca rules the owner must have the delineated wetland boundary staked in the field in order for the panel to evaluate the area the technical evaluation panel and city planner or designee may require additional information to resolve the dispute or uncertainty no boundary change may be authorized on the basis of fill that was placed on the site after the city designated the area as part of the wetland overlay district persons aggrieved by a decision of the city planner or designee may appeal the decision as provided in section 30003 subdivision 1 of this ordinance and the wca rules as applicable amended by adopted  5 wetland buffer areas athis subsection establishes requirements for wetland buffer areas around protected type 28 wetlands buffer areas are necessary and beneficial to maintain the health of wetlands buffer areas protect the edge of wetlands from erosion while filtering sediment chemicals and other nutrients from runoff that drains into wetlands buffer areas can improve the biological diversity and health of a wetland environment while reducing the adverse impacts of human activities bbuffer areas regulated by this section are areas of vegetative cover that are upland of the wetland edge and that occur in a natural condition or buffer areas consist of shrubbery and trees and native grasses or forbs or both that are not mowed fertilized or manicured in any manner cwetland buffer areas must be created or existing buffer areas must be maintained around all protected type 28 wetlands in the following situations 1when wetlands are required to be replaced or restored  2when new development occurs for purposes of this subsection new development means aany subdivision that creates a new lot that has no principal use on it  bconstruction of a principal use on an existing vacant parcel of land  3when redevelopment occurs for purposes of this section redevelopment means the reconstruction of the principal structure if it includes the removal of the principal structure by more than 50 percent of the square footage of the building footprint or an increase of the square footage of the building footprint by more than 50 percent this requirement does not apply if construction is the result of more than 50 percent of the building being damaged by an involuntary force such as fire wind or vandalism  4when the city requires a buffer as part of a variance expansion permit conditional use permit or a site

cash escrow or letter of credit equal to 150 percent of the cost to install the required buffer fthe city may allow the disturbance of an existing buffer area during the course of construction activity this disturbance must be kept to a minimum soils must be decompacted to a level that will accommodate root growth and the buffer area must be reestablished as required by the city the city will determine the amount of allowable disturbance the city may require a cash escrow or letter of credit equal to 150 percent of the cost to reestablish the buffer to its original condition gthe city may require buffer area planting and maintenance when the city determines that there is inadequate vegetation in the buffer area to meet the intent of this section the city may require a cash escrow

flood boundary on the most recent flood insurance rate maps dated  contained in the flood insurance study for the city of minnetonka titled hennepin county mn all jurisdictions volume 1 and volume 2 dated  and prepared by fema these maps may also be amended by other studies adopted by ordinance by the city and that are not less restrictive than the 100year flood elevation and the floodways as published by fema these maps constitute the official floodplain district map for the city all notations references and data shown on the maps are incorporated by reference into this ordinance the fema floodplain is comprised of the following three separate districts a floodway district the fema floodway district includes these areas within zone ae that have a floodway delineated as shown on the

adopted   amended by adopted  3 interpretation of floodplain boundaries the boundaries of the floodplain district will be determined by scaling distances on the official floodplain district map and by the use of the water surface profile of the 100year flood as shown in the flood insurance study or by other approved studies where interpretation is needed regarding the exact location of the boundary of the district as shown on the official floodplain district map or where there appears to be a conflict between the location of the boundary shown on the official floodplain district map and actual field conditions all decisions will be based on the 100year flood elevations shown on the flood insurance study and maps if available when evidence of fill exists the ground elevations that existed on the site as of  must be submitted and will be used in this determination if a 100year flood elevation is not available on the flood insurance study maps the city engineer may establish the boundary at the 100year flood elevation as defined in the citys water resources management plan the city engineer may also require the submission of a registered survey of the property and such other information

20 performance standards regulating steep slopes apurpose the purposes of the standards governing the alteration of steep slopes are to 1preserve steep slopes in essentially their natural state as part of a comprehensive open space plan  2encourage alternative approaches to conventional flatland development practices in areas of steep slopes including the planning of development which fits the existing topography of the site  3minimize grading and cutandfill operations consistent with the retention of the natural character of steep slopes  4minimize the short and longterm increase in stormwater waterrunoff and soil erosion problems incurred in the grading and development of steep slopes  5preserve the predominant views both from and of the steep slopes  and 6preserve the variety of topography which exists in the city and is an integral part of this citys identity bstandards 1the city may require that a property be rezoned and developed as a planned unit development to utilize flexible development standards to preserve steep slopes 2construction development grading filling and any other method of alteration may occur on a steep slope only if they meet the standards of this ordinance and are approved by the city city approval will be by the city council planning commission or city planner depending on who is authorized to approve the associated development application 3the city will approve steep slope development only if the city can make the findings specified below in making these findings the city will evaluate the extent to which the development meets the design guidelines included under each finding it is the intent to require compliance with as many design guidelines as possible but the city may choose to not require compliance with every guideline if the findings are still achieved finding 1the property is physically suitable for the design and siting of the proposed development the proposed development will preserve significant natural features by minimizing disturbance to existing topographical forms adesign developments into steep slopes rather than making significant alterations to the slope to fit the development 1avoid building pads that result in extensive grading outside the building footprint and driveway areas  2use retaining walls as an alternative to banks of cutandfill and design and site such walls to avoid adverse visual impact  3allow for clustering with different lot shapes and sizes with the prime determinant being to maximize the preservation of the natural terrain  4allow flag lots when appropriate to minimize grading  5avoid cuts and fills greater than 25 feet in depth  and 6design grading to preserve the crest of prominent ridges buildings may be located on the prominent ridges as long as the requirements of this subdivision are met bdesign streets and driveways that generally follow existing contours except where necessary for public safety or to minimize the adverse impacts from traffic 1use culdesacs and common drives where practical and desirable to preserve slopes  and 2avoid individual long driveways unless necessary to locate the principal structure on a less sensitive area of the site cconcentrate development on the least sensitive portion of the site to maximize the preservation of significant trees and natural features 1preserve sensitive areas by clustering buildings or using other innovative approaches  and 2maintain sufficient vegetation and design the scale of development so that it does not overwhelm the natural character of the steep slope dpreserve steep slopes that buffer residences from nonresidential sources of light and noise finding 2the development will not result in soil erosion flooding severe scarring reduced water quality inadequate drainage control or other problems awherever practical minimize the impervious surface area and maximize the use of the natural drainage systems 1design any new drainage systems away from neighboring properties away from cut faces or sloping surfaces of a fill and toward appropriate drainage facilities whether artificial or natural drainage systems must comply with the citys water resources management plan  and 2use the existing natural drainage system as much as possible in its unimproved state if the natural system adequately controls erosion bavoid building on or creating steep slopes with an average grade of 30 percent or more the city may prohibit building on or creating such slopes in the following situations 1where the city determines that reasonable development can occur on the site without building on or creating such slopes  or 2development on such slopes would create real or potentially detrimental drainage or erosion problems cdesign slopes to be in character with the surrounding natural terrain  duse benching terracing or other slopestabilizing techniques for fill as determined appropriate by the city engineer  einstall and maintain erosion control measures during construction in accordance with the current minnesota pollution control agency best management practices  and frevegetate disturbed slopes as soon as practical after grading to stabilize steep slopes and prevent erosion as required by the city finding 3the proposed development provides adequate measures to protect public safety alimit the slopes of private driveways to not more than 10 percent unless necessary to minimize excessive grading where the grade exceeds 10 percent the driveway should have sufficient flat areas at the top and toe to provide vehicles a landing area and to avoid vehicles slipping onto the adjacent street during icy conditions the city may require a driveway turnaround  and bprovide sufficient access for emergency vehicles to reach the proposed buildings

to require site plan approval instead of administrative approval 2all other improvements require site plan approval notwithstanding any other provision of this ordinance to the contrary gwork that constitutes an expansion of any nonconforming use may not be done without first obtaining a variance pursuant to section 30007 or an expansion permit pursuant to subdivision 7 of this section 1a variance is required if the expansion will intrude into one or more setback areas beyond the distance of the existing structure or will exceed the height or size limitations in this section 300 by a distance or amount greater than the existing structure otherwise an expansion permit is required for example if the building currently has a front setback of 25 feet when 30 feet is required and the expansion would reduce the setback to 24 feet then a variance is required in contrast if only a portion of the building has a front setback of 25 feet when 30 is required and the expansion brings the rest of the building to the same setback of 25 feet then an expansion permit is required rather than a variance 2an expansion permit is also required if  athe use occupies any space within a nonconforming area that was previously not occupied both vertically and horizontally for example an expansion permit would be required if a second floor area is expanded into the nonconforming setback over an existing nonconforming first floor even though the nonconformity of the first floor setback dimension stays the same or is reduced  or bthe nonconforming aspect of a use is reduced but still does not comply with current ordinance standards hnotwithstanding the prohibitions contained in the foregoing paragraphs of this subdivision if approved by the city council a nonconforming use may be

planned i394 district 1 purpose the purpose of the planned i394 district is to establish a comprehensive planned framework for development within the i394 corridor the city has determined that it is in the best interest of the city and the region to responsibly manage corridor growth specific development goals within the i394 corridor include the following alimitation of development to ensure reasonable traffic operations because population and employment distribution and traffic generation resulting from existing and future corridor development has the potential to overload the capacity of regional and local road systems development will be limited to ensure reasonable traffic operations on corridor road systems including i394 interchanges  bencouragement of a high quality development standard for structures within the corridor because properties fronting i394 are among the most visible in the city it is in the best interest of the city and individual properties within the corridor to encourage a highquality development standard for structures within the corridor  cprotection of the natural environment including areas of steep slopes mature trees floodplainwetlands open space and drainage  dpromotion of neighborhood stability and protection of property values use of buffers between land uses of different intensity  epromotion of flexibility in land development and redevelopment in order to utilize new techniques of building design construction and land development also flexibility in locating specific land uses will allow development options which do not overburden the capacity of the planned road system  fmore efficient and effective use of land open space and public facilities of land use and assembly and development of land in larger parcels  gprovision of alternative housing types in a range of affordability  henergy conservation use of more efficient building designs and sitings and the clustering of buildings and land uses  and idevelopment which is consistent with the comprehensive guide plan 1981 as amended by the i394 corridor study 1987 2 definitions for the purpose of this section and section 30032 i394 redevelopment overlay districts definitions contained in section 30002 and the following shall apply aall references to types of parcels or areas by use such as residential areas means the type and intensity of use

not including architectural setbacks or projections included are all stories or areas that have floor surfaces with clear standing head room 6 feet 6 inches minimum regardless of their use where a ground level area or part thereof within the principal outside faces of the exterior walls is left unenclosed the gross area of the unenclosed portion is to be considered as a part of the overall square footage of the building all unroofed areas and unenclosed roofedover spaces except as defined above are to be excluded from the area calculations for purposes of trip generation calculation the gross area of any parking garages within the building shall not be included within the gross area of the entire building cgross leasable area  for trip generation calculation purposes means the total building floor area designed for tenant occupancy and exclusive use including any basements mezzanines or upper floors expressed in square feet and measured from the centerline of joint partitions and

and  pm esubstantial compliance  means that the limits shall be an absolute maximum except that a greater number of trips or larger building square footage will be allowed if the adverse impact on the road system caused by the particular use would be less than expected as determined by a traffic impact study approved by the city a lower adverse impact could result from a category of use which generates more favorable turning movements than assumed in the traffic projections or from a lower actual pm peak rate fcomprehensive plan or comprehensive guide plan or guide plan  means the

income for a specific period of time amended by adopted  6 traffic the city has determined that future growth within the planned i394 district must be responsibly managed under a planned framework of development parameters a crucial element of planned growth management involves the maintenance of acceptable levels of traffic operation on regional and local road systems in order to maintain the functional capacity of area road systems a development limitation based on pm peak hour trip generation is established for new development further the i394 system design is based on a commitment to transit alternatives including high occupancy vehicle lanes park and ride lots and timed transfer transit stations a commitment from development projects within the i394 corridor to manage traffic and to utilize transit alternatives is necessary to maintain the design capacity of the road system all parcels within the planned i394 district are subject to the following traffic requirements atraffic impact studies a traffic impact study prepared by a registered traffic engineer to assess potential traffic impacts on local and regional road systems is required for any of the following 1any development which exceeds 25000 square feet of gross floor area  2expansion of existing development which exceeds 10 percent of gross floor area and the total gross floor area is 25000 square feet or greater  or 3any development for which the pm peak hour trip generation rate as defined by the institute of traffic engineers is expected to exceed two pm peak hour trips per 1000 square feet of gross floor area btrip generation to avoid exceeding acceptable levels of service at area intersections and thus overburdening the capacity of the road system development limitations based on pm peak hour trip generation are established in subdivision 13 for each parcel of land in the i394 corridor these have been developed using recognized methods of traffic forecasting all property in the i394 corridor was divided into traffic analysis zones traffic generation and distribution were analyzed based upon reasonable development on all parcels a maximum number of pm peak hour trips per traffic analysis zone were calculated based upon the approved traffic levels at interchanges as specified in the i394 corridor plan the total number of trips were allocated on the basis of square footage of buildable property in each zone regardless of present or future use the trip generation number specified in subdivision 13 is the maximum number of pm peak hour trips that may be generated by any permitted use of property to determine the maximum square footage of building space which is allowed for each parcel the trip limitation number is divided by the pm peak hour rate for that use the applicable rates are defined by the traffic analysis included with the i394 corridor study substantial compliance with the trip generation number and resultant maximum square footage of buildable space is required in determining trip generation and building square footage allowable gross floor area of a building shall be used in cases where there is a substantial amount of common area within a building and when institute of traffic engineers data is based on gross leasable area gross leasable area may be used uses existing on the effective date of this section which generate pm peak hour trips or which have a building area greater than the number assigned may continue to exist as nonconforming developments these uses shall be subject to the restrictions contained in section 30029  however each of these uses shall be allowed to expand by no more than 10 percent of existing building area if measures are taken to keep the traffic generation at the rate existing on the effective date of this section an expansion beyond that amount or a change of use shall be permitted only if there is substantial compliance with the trip generation limit unused trips allocated to a parcel are not a property right which may be transferred at will to another property unused trips may be transferred but only to another parcel in the same zone and only after city council approval the council may decline to permit a transfer if it would threaten to overload the capacity of the roadway system or would otherwise not be in the public interest cappeal of pm peak hour trips appeals to the pm peak hour trips and rates may be made by any person to the planning commission and city council appeals shall be written and accompanied by a report prepared by a registered traffic engineer and deemed adequate by the city planner which shall provide evidence indicating potential errors in a pm peak trip limitation in subdivision 13 reasons why the property or development is presently or will in the future generate less pm peak hour trips or both the appeal shall be reviewed by the planning commission notices of a public meeting before the planning commission regarding the appeal shall be mailed to owners of property located wholly or partially within 400 feet of the subject property as reflected in the certified records of the hennepin county auditor the planning commission shall make a decision within 60 days following the date of submission of a completed application for appeal unless a continuance is not objected to by the applicant after receipt of the recommendation of the planning commission the city council shall consider the matter and may hold whatever hearing it deems advisable the city council shall act upon the appeal within 120 days of submission to the city of a completed application or such longer period not objected to by the applicant and shall serve a copy of its decision upon the applicant by mail if the council fails to make a timely decision the appeal shall be deemed to have been denied the city council may approve an appeal to subdivision 13 only upon an affirmative vote of at least twothirds of its full membership droad system improvements development that would exceed trip generation guidelines in subdivision 13 below may only be constructed if concurrent road system improvements to accommodate additional trip generation are installed and paid for by the developer the road system improvements must achieve a level of service operation at area intersections consistent with level of service that would have existed without the excess trip generation further the comprehensive plan has identified a series of geometric road system and traffic control improvements which are needed to accommodate trip levels specified in subdivision 13 nothing in this chapter shall be construed to eliminate developer responsibility for stated improvements if improvements are found to be needed by a traffic impact study as a result of development if a traffic impact study finds that road system improvements are required as a result of the proposed development no construction of the development shall commence until arrangements including financing for permanent improvements are made and approved by the city if qualifying warrants are not met for such improvements interim improvements shall be installed by the developer eaccess and traffic

this section is to control regulations certain land uses that have a direct and detrimental effect on the character of the citys residential and commercial neighborhoods the city council specifically recognizes the sanctity and fundamental nature of free speech and does not intend to regulate or ban speech based on content 2 findings the minnetonka city council makes the following findings regarding the effect sexuallyoriented businesses have on the character of the citys neighborhoods in making these findings the city council accepts the recommendations of a task force including staff from minnetonka and two other cities that has studied the experiences of other urban areas where sexuallyoriented businesses have located asexuallyoriented businesses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them which is distinct from the impact caused by other uses bresidential and commercial neighborhoods located within close proximity to sexually oriented businesses experience the following negative impacts 1increased crime rates particularly in sexrelated crimes such as rapes prostitution indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior  2property values which are either diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of other comparable properties not located in proximity to sexuallyoriented businesses  3increased transiency and decreased stability of ownership  4deteriorated neighborhood appearance from litter and graffiti  5sexrelated harassment of residents and customers by motorists and pedestrians  6a perception that the area is unsafe  and 7difficulty in attracting and retaining customers employees and desirable tenants cthe adverse impacts which sexuallyoriented businesses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the sexuallyoriented business increases dthe adverse impacts of sexuallyoriented businesses are exacerbated when the uses are located near each other ethe presence of liquor establishments in the immediate vicinity of sexuallyoriented businesses also compounds the adverse impacts on the neighborhood fsexuallyoriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending places of worship children attending day care centers or schools and people using public parks and libraries gsexuallyoriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area where they are located thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for city residents hthe concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses in one area can have a substantially detrimental effect on that area and on the overall quality of urban life a cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses the presence of such businesses is perceived by others as an indication that the area is deteriorating and the result can be devastating other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from the area the resulting decline in real estate values erodes the citys tax base and contributes to overall urban blight ilanduse regulations are appropriate to minimize the detrimental effects that sexually oriented businesses have on adjacent land uses 3 definitions the following words and terms shall have the

city code by adopted  repealed amended by effective  opus overlay district 1preamble the city has determined that future growth within the general area of the opus ii business park must be responsibly managed to maintain acceptable levels of traffic operation on regional and local road systems the city has also determined that the highway interchange at bren road and highway 169 is nearly at full capacity and that the interchange is the primary limiting factor for growth in the majority of the opus ii business park area limitations must be placed on this area in addition to the underlying zoning requirements in order to prevent unacceptable levels of traffic at the bren road interchange therefore the opus overlay district is established and properties in that district are subject to the provisions in this section 2boundaries of opus overlay district the opus overlay district covers the area bounded by county road no 62 on the south highway 169 on the east smetana road on the north and shady oak roadcounty road no 61 on the west the opus overlay district is further divided into four traffic analysis districts that reflect the different levels of expected distribution of traffic to the bren road interchange the boundaries of each traffic analysis district are shown in subdivision 4 3traffic requirements in order to avoid overloading the bren road interchange all nonresidential parcels within the opus overlay district are subject to the following traffic requirements if an application is submitted to increase the density of a residential parcel that application will be subject to the following requirements except for the trip generation limit if an application is submitted to change the use of a residential parcel that parcel will be subject to all of the following requirements and the city will establish an appropriate trip generation limit for that parcel atraffic impact studies a traffic impact study prepared by a registered traffic engineer to assess potential traffic impacts on local and regional road systems is required for any of the following 1any development that exceeds 25000 square feet of gross floor area  2expansion of existing development that exceeds 10 percent of gross floor area and the total gross floor area is 25000 square feet or greater  or 3any development for which the pm peak hour trip generation rate as defined by the institute of traffic engineers is expected to exceed two pm peak hour trips per 1000 square feet of gross floor area btrip generation 1development limitations based on pm peak hour trip generation are established in subdivision 4 for each parcel of nonresidential land in the opus area district that contributes traffic to the bren road interchange these development limitations have been developed by determining the maximum number of pm peak hour trips that can be accommodated at the interchange that number of trips was then allocated proportionately on the basis of the maximum development that would be allowed under current zoning standards and the rate of trip distribution to the interchange for each traffic analysis district the properties in traffic analysis district no 4 were determined to have no trips to the interchange so no trip generation limits are imposed for that district 2the trip generation numbers specified in subdivision 4 are the maximum numbers of pm peak hour trips that may be generated by nonresidential properties in traffic analysis districts no 1 2 and 3 to determine the maximum square footage of building space that is allowed for each parcel the trip limitation number is divided by the pm peak hour rate for that use the applicable rates are those specified in the opus ii area trip generation analysis dated  on file in the community development department substantial compliance with the trip generation number and resultant maximum square footage of buildable space is required in determining trip generation and allowable building square footage gross floor area of a building must be used except that gross leasable area may be used when there is a substantial amount of common area within a building and when institute of traffic engineers data is based on gross leasable area 3uses existing on  that generate greater pm peak hour trips or that have a greater building area than would be allowed by the trip generation number may continue to exist as nonconforming developments these uses are subject to the restrictions contained in section 30029  however each of these uses is allowed to expand by no more than 10 percent of existing building area if measures are taken to keep the traffic generation at the rate existing on  an expansion beyond that amount or a change of use is permitted only if there is substantial compliance with the trip generation limit 4unused trips allocated by this ordinance to a parcel under subdivision 4 are not a property right that may be transferred at will to another property allocated trips may be transferred to another property in the overlay district only with the approval of the city council which may deny the transfer if it is likely to have a negative impact on the public health safety or welfare cappeal of pm peak hour trips 1the owner of any property subject to a trip generation limit may appeal that limit to the planning commission and city council no appeal may be taken unless the affected property owner files a written appeal with the city clerk within 90 days after the adoption of this section the failure to file a timely appeal eliminates all right to challenge a trip generation limit the appeal must be accompanied by a report prepared by a registered traffic engineer the report must provide evidence indicating potential errors in a pm peak trip or rate reasons why the property or development is presently generating or will in the future generate less pm peak hour trips or both 2the appeal will be reviewed by the planning commission notices of a public meeting before the planning commission regarding the appeal will be mailed to owners of property located wholly or partially within 400 feet of the subject property as reflected in the certified records of the hennepin county auditor 3after receipt of the recommendation of the planning commission the city council will consider the matter and may hold whatever hearing it deems advisable the city council must serve a copy of its decision upon the applicant by mail the city council may approve an appeal only upon an affirmative vote of at least twothirds of its full membership droad system improvements 1development that would exceed the established trip generation limitations may only be constructed if concurrent road system improvements to accommodate the additional trip generation are paid for by the property owner the road system improvements must achieve a level of service operation at the bren road interchange consistent with the level of service that would have existed without the excess trip generation the adequacy and necessity of the road system improvements will be reviewed and approved by the city council as part of the development approvals 2if the city constructs or participates in financing road system improvements that create additional capacity at the bren road interchange after  development beyond the allocated trip generation number is allowed only if the developer helps to reimburse the city for its costs by purchasing additional trips from the city the city will determine the value of each additional trip by dividing the citys share of the total construction cost by the number of pm peak hour trips that can be added to the interchange because of the construction that value will be adjusted each year by the rate established in the engineering news record or a similar standard for determining the inflationary or deflationary rate of construction costs per year 3purchase of the additional trips from the increased capacity of the bren road interchange will be on a firstcome firstserved basis when all of the additional trips have been purchased no more fees for additional trips will be charged and no development beyond that allowed by the allocated and purchased trips may occur purchase of the additional trips may occur only after a development has received all necessary land use approvals from the city the trips will not be reserved for the development until the payment is made if all available trips have been purchased before the owner of an approved development seeks to pay for its needed trips the development may not proceed 4all purchased trips may be used only for the specific associated development approved by the city notwithstanding the foregoing the owner of purchased trips may transfer those trips to another development if the city council has given all necessary land use approvals for that other development and has approved the transfer of those trips after considering the impact on the public health safety and welfare 5nothing in this chapter may be construed to eliminate developer responsibility for other improvements unrelated to the bren road interchange if a traffic impact study finds that road system improvements unrelated to the bren road interchange are required as a result of the proposed development no construction of the development may commence until arrangements including financing for completion of permanent improvements are made and approved by the city if qualifying warrants are not met for such improvements the city may require that the property owner install interim improvements ephased occupancy the city may require phased construction or occupancy of a building or portions of a developmentredevelopment project such phasing may be

improvements to connect the city of minneapolis and many communities in the southwest suburban area planning has been ongoing for a number of years as it is a transportation project of regional significance in 200 the hennepin county regional railroad authority completed a corridorwide conceptual station area planning effort the southwest light rail transit study anticipates the location of two light rail transit stations in the city of minnetonka these stations will be catalysts for new development and redevelopment in their surrounding areas in addition the city is currently undertaking planning studies of the two areas to develop a more definitive and coordinated development plan to guide this development and redevelopment in a transitfriendly manner a coordinated development plan is necessary for the shady oak road area station because there is multiple ownership of affected properties new and realigned public infrastructure will be needed environmental cleanup is needed on some properties and many parcels have older development nearing the end of their lifecycle and are ripe for redevelopment a coordinated development plan is also necessary for the opus area station because there is multiple ownership of affected properties and the significant size of some that require further study limitations must be placed on these areas in addition to the underlying zoning requirements in order to ensure that premature development and redevelopment does not hinder or foreclose a comprehensive and cohesive plan for each area therefore the southwest light rail transit station swlrt overlay district is established and properties in that district are subject to the provisions in this section the boundaries of the district are shown on figures 361 and 362 which are a part of the official zoning map established by section 30001 subd 5 2development and redevelopment requirements all properties in the swlrt overlay district are subject to the

granted by the city the city council may rezone the property back to its original zoning classification amended by effective   section added by adopted  telecommunication facilities regulations 1 purpose and findings apurpose the purpose of this section is to establish predictable and balanced regulations for telecommunication facilities and systems in order to accommodate such within the city while protecting the community against any adverse impacts to the public welfare or aesthetic resources bfindings the city of minnetonka finds the following 1wireless telecommunication systems provide a valuable service to the public however telecommunications facilities and systems are not a public utility nor part of the public infrastructure system 2to promote and preserve the public health safety welfare and aesthetics of the community the location design construction and modification of telecommunication facilities and systems must be regulated 3to minimize the visual impact of telecommunication facilities ainstallation of facilities on existing support structures is favored over installation of new freestanding telecommunication towers  bnew telecommunication towers must be designed to accommodate more than one telecommunication provider and must incorporate stealth design techniques  and 4to minimize safety hazards and visual impacts and to ensure continued and adequate space for public utilities public rightofway should be minimally used for telecommunication facilities cseverability every section subdivision clause or phrase of this section 31003 is declared

convenience of ordinary travel over the rightofway or otherwise negatively impact the rightofway or its users in determining compliance with this standard the city many consider one or more of the following factors athe extent to which rightofway space is available for the proposed facility including accessory equipment bthe potential demand for the particular space in the rightofway cthe availability of other locations in the rightofway that would have less public impact dthe extent to which the facility placement minimizes impacts on adjacent property ethe applicability of ordinances

specific regulations 1location awithin residential zoning districts facilities are only permitted within the rightsofway of collector or arterial streets as defined in the comprehensive guide plan however in no case are facilities permitted within certain village centers as designated in subdivision 3 of this section bfacilities are not permitted adjacent to residentially zoned property unless an applicant demonstrates by providing a study prepared by a radio or electrical engineer that the proposed location is necessary to reasonably meet the coverage and capacity needs of its system and no other location is feasible in a nonresidential area 2height maximum height including attachments other than lightning rods is restricted based on the land use designation of property adjacent to

unless required by law or by a governmental agency to protect the publics health and safety or unless necessary to facilitate service to groundmounted equipment cfacilities located within certain village centers all telecommunication facilities administratively or conditionally permitted are subject to the following specific regulations 1the glen lake station and minnetonka boulevardcounty road 101 community village centers and the minnetonka mills area special purpose village center are recognized within the comprehensive guide plan as unique commercial nodes these village centers represent the earliest developed commercial areas in the city they have existing and anticipated pedestrian designs unique within minnetonka typified by sidewalks trails landscaped boulevards street lights and buried utilities accordingly there is a presumption that telecommunication facilities are prohibited in these areas an applicant may overcome this presumption by submitting an analysis prepared by a radio or electrical engineer showing that no other available location allowed under this ordinance would meet its reasonable coverage and capacity needs 2if telecommunication facilities are permitted in these special village centers under paragraph a above then the installation of the facilities must meet the following additional standards aaccessory equipment must be located within a principal building if space is not available in the principal building an accessory building may be used the accessory building must meet the construction standard of the applicable zoning district and must complement the principal structure design and materials btelecommunication facilities may not be located within public rightofway or within any front yard the council may waive one or both of these restrictions if the proposal would provide a public benefit such as improving the existing site aesthetics 7 exceptions this ordinance does not apply to any facility or device that is used for the private enjoyment of those on the premises where it is located examples include amateur radio antennas and antennas receiving television signals for viewing on site such facilities or devices are considered accessory uses and are regulated as such in each zoning district amended by effective  sign regulations purpose and findings 1 purpose the sign ordinance is intended to establish a comprehensive and balanced system of sign control that accommodates the need for a wellmaintained safe and attractive community and the need for effective communications including business identification it is the intent of this section to promote the health safety general welfare aesthetics and image of the community by regulating signs that are intended to communicate to the public and to use signs that meet the citys goals by authorizing apermanent signs that establish a high standard of aesthetics  bsigns that are compatible with their surroundings  csigns that are designed constructed installed and maintained in a manner that does not adversely impact public safety or unduly distract motorists  dsigns that are large enough to convey the intended message and to help citizens find their way to intended destinations  esigns that are proportioned to the scale of and are architecturally compatible with principal structures  fpermanent signs that give preference to the onpremise owner or occupant  and g temporary commercial signs and advertising displays that provide an opportunity for grand openings and occasional sales events while restricting signs that create continuous visual clutter and hazards at public rightofway intersections 2 findings the city of minnetonka finds it is necessary for the promotion and preservation of the public health safety welfare and aesthetics of the community that the construction location size and maintenance of signs be controlled further the city finds apermanent and temporary signs have a direct impact on and relationship to the image of the community  bthe manner of installation location and maintenance of signs affects the public health safety welfare and aesthetics of the community  can opportunity for viable identification of community businesses and institutions must be established  dthe safety of motorists cyclists pedestrians and other users of public streets and property is affected by the number size location and appearance of signs that unduly divert the attention of drivers  einstallation of signs suspended from projecting over or placed on the tops of buildings walks or other structures may constitute a hazard during periods of high winds and an obstacle to effective firefighting and other emergency service  funcontrolled and unlimited signs adversely impact the image and aesthetic attractiveness of the community and thereby undermine economic value and growth  guncontrolled and unlimited signs particularly temporary signs which are commonly located within or adjacent to public rightofway or are located at drivewaystreet intersections result in roadside clutter and obstruction of views of oncoming traffic this creates a hazard to drivers and pedestrians and also adversely impacts a logical flow of information  hcommercial signs are generally incompatible with residential uses and should be strictly limited in residential zoning districts  and ithe right to express noncommercial opinions in any zoning district must be protected subject to reasonable restrictions on size height location and number 3 severability every section subdivision clause or phrase

standards in accordance with the citys instructions the adjustment must be made immediately upon notice of noncompliance from the city the person owning or controlling the sign may appeal the citys determination following appeal procedure 1after making the adjustment required by the city the person owning or controlling the sign may appeal the citys determination by delivering a written appeal

natural light must be equipped with a mechanism that automatically adjusts the brightness in response to ambient conditions these signs must also be equipped with a means to immediately turn off the display or lighting if it malfunctions and the sign owner or operator must immediately turn off the sign or lighting when notified by the city that it is not complying with the standards in this section 9outdoor advertising displays outdoor advertising signs which exist as of  are nonconforming signs a permanent outdoor advertising sign is a principal use of property no permitted or conditionally permitted use or any part of such use may be located on the same parcel of property as such a sign the parcel on which such a sign is located may not be subdivided to segregate the sign from the remaining property for the purposes of this paragraph parcel of property means any property for which one property identification number has been issued by the county or all contiguous property in common ownership as of  whichever is greater 10dynamic displays afindings studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look people have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end additionally drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fadeins and fadeouts finally drivers are generally more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more than a simple message time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included without those requirements however there is the potential for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway if more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a road the minimum display time becomes critical if the display time is too short a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement this impact would obviously be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs if dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each signs ability to change frequently drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload therefore a longer display time is appropriate a constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination changing messages detract from this wayfinding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct second lane changes stops or turns which could result in traffic accidents accordingly dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign in conclusion the city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety bregulations dynamic displays on signs are allowed subject to the following conditions 1dynamic displays are allowed only on monument and pylon signs for conditionally permitted uses in residential districts and for all uses in other districts dynamic displays may occupy no more than 50 percent of the actual copy and graphic area the remainder of the sign must not have the capability to have dynamic displays even if not used only one contiguous dynamic display area is allowed on a sign face  2a dynamic display may not change or move more often than once every 20 minutes except one for which changes are necessary to correct hourandminute date or temperature information time date or temperature information is considered one dynamic display and may not be included as a component of any other dynamic display a display of time date or temperature must remain for at least 20 minutes before changing to a different display but the time date or temperature information itself may change no more often than once every three seconds  3the images and messages displayed must be static and the transition from one static display to another must be instantaneous without any special effects  4the images and messages displayed must be complete in themselves without continuation in content to the next image or message or to any other sign  5every line of copy and graphics in a dynamic display must be at least seven inches in height on a road with a speed limit of 25 to 34 miles per hour nine inches on a road with a speed limit of 35 to 44 miles per hour 12 inches on a road with a speed limit of 45 to 54 miles per hour and 15 inches on a road with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour or more if there is insufficient room for copy and graphics of this size in the area allowed under clause 1 above then no dynamic display is allowed  6dynamic displays must be designed and equipped to freeze the device in one position if a malfunction occurs the displays must also be equipped with a means to immediately discontinue the display if it malfunctions and the sign owner must immediately stop the dynamic display when notified by the city that it is not complying with the standards of this ordinance  7dynamic displays must comply with the brightness standards contained in subdivision 15  8dynamic displays existing on  must comply with the operational standards listed above an existing dynamic display that does not meet the structural requirements in clause 1 may continue as a nonconforming development subject to section 30029 an existing dynamic display that cannot meet the minimum size requirement in clause 5 must use the largest size possible for one line of copy to fit in the available space cincentives outdoor advertising signs do not need to serve the same wayfinding function as do onpremises signs further outdoor advertising signs are no longer allowed in the city and there is no potential that they will proliferate finally outdoor advertising signs are in themselves distracting and their removal serves public safety the city is extremely limited in its ability to cause the removal of those signs this clause is intended to provide incentives for the voluntary and uncompensated removal of outdoor advertising signs in certain settings this removal results in an overall advancement of one or more of the goals set forth in this section that should more than offset any additional burden caused by the incentives these provisions are also based on the recognition that the incentives create an opportunity to consolidate outdoor advertising services that would otherwise remain distributed throughout the community 1a person may obtain a permit for an enhanced dynamic display on one face of an outdoor advertising sign if the following requirements are met athe applicant agrees in writing to permanently remove within 15 days after issuance of the permit at least two other faces of an outdoor advertising sign in the city that are owned or leased by the applicant each of which must satisfy the criteria of parts b d of this subsection this removal must include the complete removal of the structure and foundation supporting each sign face the applicant must agree that the city may remove the sign if the applicant does not timely do so

in the city that add diversity and a richness to the quality of life  certain areas in the city have been left or allowed to go unmaintained these have been accepted by the vast majority of the city residents as appropriate and as part of the unique quality of life in this community there are community expectations however that once an area has been disturbed landscaped or otherwise maintained that area will continue to be maintained in a consistent manner when vegetation in that area is not continually maintained it becomes aesthetically unpleasing and violates community standards property that appears neglected may decrease the value of adjacent properties in addition if vegetation is not properly maintained there may be the following adverse impacts on public health safety and welfare aundesirable vegetation such as common buckthorn quackgrass and other weeds may invade and threaten to supplant other more desirable vegetation  bvegetation that causes allergic reactions such as ragweed may develop  and ctall vegetation along driveways and public roads may impair visibility when entering or exiting public roads the city council also finds that it is in the public interest to allow citizens to choose the type of landscaping on their properties and to make changes in that vegetation as a protection for the larger community however this change in vegetation must be properly managed and maintained and the length of the transition period must be minimized the council finds that the establishment of prairie and meadow plant communities is an acceptable landscape treatment in the city this requires special consideration however because weeds will grow during the first few years of transition before the new vegetation predominates and will appear like neglect therefore the council finds that this type of vegetation is acceptable if it is properly maintained to shorten the transition period and if notice is given of the intended result in contrast the transition to trees and other woody species does not require special consideration because untended grass or weeds are not a necessary part of that transition period rather the transition period is shortened by

should be prevented as much as possible dgatherings involving underage possession and consumption often occur outside the presence of parents or other responsible adults however there are times when a parent or other adult is present and condones the activity and in some circumstances provides the alcohol ealthough furnishing alcohol to an underage person is a crime it is difficult to prove and an

consumption occurs 2the purpose of this section is to discourage underage possession and consumption of alcohol even if done within the confines of a private residence and to hold persons criminally

citations and civil penalties for violations of the city code  purpose the city council finds that there is a need for alternative methods of enforcing the city code while criminal fines and penalties have been the most frequent enforcement mechanism there are certain negative consequences for both the city and the accused the delay inherent in that system does not ensure prompt resolution citizens resent being labeled as criminals for violations of administrative regulations the higher burden of proof and the potential of incarceration do not appear appropriate for most administrative violations the criminal process does not always regard city code violations as being important accordingly the city council finds that the use of administrative citations and the imposition of civil penalties is a legitimate and necessary alternative method of enforcement this method of enforcement is in addition to any other legal remedy that may be pursued for city code violations  general
