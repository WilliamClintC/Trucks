zone is established as a zone in which agriculture and certain related uses are encouraged as the principal uses of land the specific intent of the agricultural zone is to facilitate the longterm use of lands best suited to agricultural production by preventing a mixture of urban and rural uses which often create incompatibilities and conflicts with agricultural pursuits which place unbalanced tax loads on agricultural lands and which may result in speculative or inflated land values which encourage the premature termination of agricultural pursuits b conservation zone vc1 the conservation zone is established to prevent the construction upon or alteration of rural or natural environments which have natural conditions of soil slope susceptibility to flooding or erosion geological condition vegetation or an interaction between the aforesaid which make such lands unsuitable for urban development further this zone is established to protect areas of the environment that if altered would cause health or pollution problems and environmental deterioration the conservation zone will also insure adequate areas for future conservation and recreational pursuits certain agricultural uses would be permitted c the estate residential zone vre1 the estate residential zone is established as a lowdensity residential zone for families who wish the privacy of large lot subdivisions the zone is mainly designed however for developments in areas which because of their proximity to other area developments or appealing natural landscapes are in demand for residential use but where conditions of slope soil vegetation drainage or geological features or an interrelationship between the aforementioned conditions makes the area in whole or part unsuited for high density development for this reason the granting of the vre1 zone must be conditioned upon a combined zoning and subdivision process  specially imposed lot sizes of not less than one nor more than 3 acres  and special setback and yard requirements which would allow resubdivision when public utilities reach the site authorized density   one to 3 acres per unit depending on site conditions d the suburban residential zone vr1 the suburban residential zone is provided for lowdensity developments especially in areas which are suitable for development but which must be serviced by individual wells and septic disposal systems because of the lack of readily accessible community facilities again the exact zoning density must relate to the availability of ground water suitability of soil slope and other features authorized density   one to 2 units per acre depending on site conditions e urban residential zone vr2 the urban residential zone is established to provide mediumlow density developments and must have community water and sewer utilities or their equivalent readily available authorized density   2 to 3 units per acre depending on site conditions f the urban residential zone vr3 the urban residential zone is established to provide medium density development in areas where water and sewer utilities are readily available and where municipal services are available to handle necessary police recreation education and fire protection needs the classification of land as an urban residential zone must depend on adequate municipal services including streets water and sewer facilities authorized density  3 to 5 units per acre depending on site conditions g the mixed residential zone vr5 the mixed residential zone is established to provide a variety of housing types related to the size and character of the development site or lot this zone can be used for older neighborhoods to allow transition of larger houses from owner to rental occupied without creating overcrowding or detrimental conditions to the neighborhoods environment and to allow economical new construction in such neighborhoods as well as new areas suited to lowdensity multifamily development the adequate municipal services including

area per family contained in the site exclusive of the area occupied by streets will not be less than the land area per family required in the district in which the development is located even though individual lots may be reduced below minimum lot area normally allowed in the zone average overall land area per family exclusive of streets refers to the allowance of reduced lot sizes below those normally required by this ordinance in exchange for an equal amount of public open space areas reduced sizes of multiple family lots cannot be offset by increased sizes of singlefamily lots to arrive at the required average overall land per family as this does not create public open space areas 5 all portions of the tract carrying a residential classification will be used for singlefamily

development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication the total requirement shall be six and onquarter 625 acres of land per one thousand 1000 of ultimate population in accordance with the following classifications minimum acres type of recreation area size range per 1000 people 1 play lot minimum 8000 sq feet  not applicable 2 school  park minimum park of 5 acres 150 neighborhood playground 3 neighborhood park minimum 3 acres to 5 acres 150 4 community wide minimum 12 acres recreation park to 30 acres 325 625  625 acres of land per 1000 population the most recent census of the village shall be used to determine the population per household b location and ownership comprehensive park ordinance plans appropriate standards adopted by affected park districts and adopted municipal and county plans shall be used as a guideline in locating an acceptable site where an elementary school site of not less than 5 acres exists it shall be a guideline to dedicate a part of all of the parkland adjoining the school site a central location which will serve equally the entire development is most desirable in a large development these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances from residential areas each park site should have at least 60foot frontage on dedicated public roads full free simple title to the dedicated parkland shall be held by one of the following as listed in order of preference village local park districtpark commission township school district when necessary operation improvement and maintenance may be done by a homeowners association with the execution of the appropriate legal documents it shall be the option of the village to require a land donation or a cash contribution c credit for private open spaces and recreation areas when subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services depending on the size of the development a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may at the option of the village board be provided in the form of private open space inlieuof dedicated public open space the term private shall include as a minimum all of the residents who may at any one time own lease or hold any legal or equitable interest in any part of the land involved in said development the extent of same shall be determined by the village board based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area in general a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities including equipment by the developers as part of their obligation detailed plans of such areas including specifications of facilities to be installed must be approved by the village board and before any credit is given for private recreation areas the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents private swimming clubs are included in this provision when an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted it will be necessary to compute the total parkland dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given d reservation of additional land where the comprehensive plan of the village calls for a larger amount of park and recreational land in a particular proposed subdivision or planned unit development than the developer is required to dedicate the land needed beyond the developers contribution shall if so determined by the village board be reserved for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designated by the village provided that such acquisition is made within one year from the date of approval of the final plat 2 criteria for requiring a contribution inlieuof park when the village at its sole option elects to accept a cash contribution in lieu of parkland the cash contribution shall be paid to the village of mt zion solely for the use of the village of mt zion parks and recreation department a fair market value the cash contribution inlieuof land shall be based on the fair market value of the improved land because of the diversity of lands within the county a single determination of fair market value is not possible the fair market value of the improved land shall be recommended by the supervisor of assessment officer of macon county this valuation recommended by the supervisor of assessment shall be used unless any subdivider developer or public body files a written objection thereto within fourteen 14 days of the receipt of notice of the valuation in the event of any such objection the subdivider developer or public body shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of such improved land in the area of development or other evidence a hearing shall be had before the village board of trustees within sixty 60 days of the date of filing said objection with notice to be sent to all interested parties in addition to notices by publication all notices shall be given not less than fifteen 15 but no more than thirty 30 days prior to the said date of hearing final determination of said fair market value per acres of such improved land shall be made by the village board based on such information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources as may be submitted to the board the village staff andor by affected parties b criteria for requiring dedication and a fee there will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution inlieuof land are both necessary these occasions will arise when 1 only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park site that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid and a cash contribution inlieuthereof shall be required for any additional land that would have to be dedicated 2 a major part of the local park

by the developer or the letter of credit expires the letter of credit shall expressly provide that it may be drawn against by the village at any time the developer fails to make the required payments at the appropriate time the developer shall make the cash contribution required directly to the body as determined at the time of final plat approval said collector shall issue a receipt as evidence of payment 3 title to sites all sites shall be conveyed to the village either by warranty or trustees deed the subdivider or developer shall be responsible for conveying good merchantable title to such sites and shall be responsible for payment of all real estate taxes to the date of conveyance  4 improved sites all sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical
