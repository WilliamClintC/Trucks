period runoff d for a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple directions of runoff discharge individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate e for a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site in this case peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate  provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate f for a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and partially within a conditional no detention subarea in no event shall a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate control be drained to the discharge points located in the no detention subarea g within a release rate category area for a proposed

conditional no detention district the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can provide that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the delaware river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in of this section if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification 2

b any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity c developerprocessed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with of this section 3 any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per  20312 l regional detention alternatives for certain areas within the study area it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate  20310 general provisions  20310  reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a casebycase basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas hydrologic model refers to the calibrated version of the penn state runoff model as developed for the stormwater management plan m capacity improvements 1 in certain instances primarily within the conditional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site peak flow calculations are to be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in of this section all new development in the entire subareas within which the proposed developed site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any 2 capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional detention

statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation changes the natural hydrologic patterns destroys aquatic habitat elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater e federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the

law a mapping of stormwater management districts to implement the provisions of the hokendauqua creek and lehigh river subbasins  20339 general provisions  20340  watershed stormwater management plan the municipality is hereby divided into stormwater management districts consistent with the hokendauqua creek and lehigh river subbasins release rate map presented in the plan update the boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the municipal office a copy of the official map at a reduced scale is included in appendix a for general reference64 b description of stormwater management districts two types of stormwater management districts may be applicable to the municipality namely conditionalprovisional no detention districts and dual release rate districts as described below 1 conditionalprovisional no detention districts within these districts the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities as defined in  20335 must be calculated to determine if adequate capacity exists for this determination the developer must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the existing condition the developer must also calculate peak flows assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this article the larger of the two peak flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists if adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel as defined in  20335 these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention facilities if the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with  20341p any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in  20341d by definition a storm drainage problem area associated with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist sites in these districts are still required to meet all of the water quality requirements in  20339 2 dual release rate districts within these districts the twoyear postdevelopment peak discharge must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment twoyear runoff peak further the ten twentyfive and onehundredyear post development peak runoff must be controlled to the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak release rates associated with the ten hundredyear events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed for the monocacy creek and nancy run watersheds 64editors note appendix a is on file in the borough offices  20340 northampton code  20340   20341 stormwater management district implementation provisions the original single release rate districts become dual release rate districts due to the channel protection standard requiring developments to meet a twoyear 30% release rate a applicants shall provide a comparative pre and postconstruction stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this article b any stormwater management controls required by this article and subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two ten twentyfive and onehundredyear return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in  20342 c the exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the twofoot topographic contours provided as part of the drainage plan the district boundaries as originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or in certain instances are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a potential flow obstruction eg road culvert bridge etc the physical feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines d any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this article shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates 1 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a twoyear return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion 2 natural or manmade channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property 3 culverts bridges storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with dep regulations if applicable and at minimum pass the increased twentyfiveyear return period runoff e for a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea the total runoff from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple  20340 general provisions  20341  directions of runoff discharge individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate f for a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate the calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea an exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site in this case peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate g for a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and partially within a conditionalprovisional no detention subarea the size of the predevelopment drainage area on a site may not be changed postdevelopment to create potentially adverse conditions on downstream properties except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure h no portion of a site may be regraded between the hokendauqua creek and lehigh river subbasins watershed and any adjacent watershed except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure i within a release rate category area for a proposed development site which has areas which drain to a closed depressions the design release from the site will be the lesser of a the applicable release rate flow assuming no closed depressions  or b the existing peak flow actually leaving the site in cases where b would result in an unreasonably small design release the design discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined by the available downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using d and the minimum orifice criteria j offsite areas which drain proposed development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates however onsite drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey offsite flows development site using the capacity criteria in the detention criteria in  20342 k for development sites proposed to take place in phases all detention ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rates applied to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction all site tributary areas will be assumed as developed regardless of whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that time an exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated release rate l where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area only the proposed impact  20341 northampton code  20341  area shall be subject to the release rate criteria the impact area includes any proposed cover or grading changes m development proposals which recharge or other means do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the release rate provisions of this article n no harm water quantity option for any proposed development site not located in a conditionalprovisional no detention district the developer has the option of using a lessrestrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan special circumstances are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control strategy proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with the delaware or lehigh river proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification 1 attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions a the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms two ten twentyfive and onehundred year shall be the values from the calibrated psrm model for the hokendauqua creek and lehigh river subbasins or as calculated by an applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the municipality the flow values from the psrm model would be supplied to the developer by the municipality upon request b any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity c developerproposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempts to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with  general provisions  20341   20342 calculation methodology 2 any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per  20343 developers submitting no harm justifications must still meet all of the water quality requirements in  20339 o regional detention alternatives for certain areas within the study area it may be more costeffective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site the initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers the design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required release rate at the point of discharge p capacity improvements 1 in certain instances primarily within the conditionalprovisional no detention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site peak flow calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in all new development in the entire subareas within which the proposed development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developers proposed discharge control if any 2 capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream a stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using either the rational method or the soilcovercomplex methodology b infiltration bmp loading rate percentages in the recommendation chart for infiltration stormwater management bmps in carbonate bedrock in appendix d65 shall be
