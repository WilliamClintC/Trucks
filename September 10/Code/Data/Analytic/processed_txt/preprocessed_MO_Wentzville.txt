development district is to provide a means of achieving a greater flexibility in development of land in a manner not possible in conventional zones  to encourage more imaginative and innovative design of projects  to promote a more desirable community environment  to embrace promote preserve and enhance the public and private urban forest  and to retain maximum control over both the structure and future operation of the development the planned development district serves to preserve existing natural features scenic qualities or existing open and wooded spaces and adapt the development to existing land features 2 the board of aldermen upon recommendation by the planning and zoning commission may by ordinance adopted in the same manner as zoning districts are created authorize a planned development district when the proposed development or use of a specific tract of land or area warrants greater flexibility control and density than would otherwise be possible under the general regulations which do not permit excessive densities or the development of incompatible land uses either within a development or as the development relates to the general neighborhood 3 the city may upon proper application approve a planned development using flexible techniques of land development and site design to gain relief from zoning requirements in relation to lot size dwelling size and property line setbacks designed for conventional developments  provided however that the application shall not conflict with or result in encroachment upon any standard of chapter 410 and shall only be approved upon demonstration of achievement of one or more of the following objectives a environmental design in the development of land that is of a higher quality than is possible under the regulations otherwise applicable to the property b diversification in the uses permitted and variation of the relationship of uses structures open space and height of structures in developments intended as cohesive unified projects c functional and beneficial uses of open space areas and preservation and protection of natural features of a development site inclusive of preservation planting maintenance restoration protection and survival of desirable tree canopy areas within a development site d establishment and maintenance of the neighborhood concept by allowing nonresidential uses within the development thereby discouraging strip commercial development e creation of a safe and desirable living environment for residential areas characterized by a unified building and site development program f rational and cost effective development in relation to public services and public and private infrastructure installation and maintenance by reducing the distance utilities are extended and installed or reducing width and length of streets except that no easement encroachments shall be permitted as a result of the review and processing of any preliminary or final development plan required by this section g efficient and effective traffic circulation both within and adjacent to the development site and the encouragement of pedestrian and nonmotorized pathway utilizing site features compliant with the trail master plan or land use plan and thus establishing performance standards that ensure sidewalks and trails are not impeded by motor vehicles associated with the development h to decrease or minimize nonpoint source pollution impacts by reducing the amount of impervious surfaces in site development b relationship of planned development districts to zoning 1 mapped district the pd designation is not intended to be attached to existing use districts as an overlay the pd designation as detailed in this section is a separate use district and may be attached to a parcel of land as an original zoning district or it may be attached to a parcel of land process of zoning map amendment rezoning a zoning map amendment to achieve the pd designation shall comply with the requirements and procedures of article x of this chapter including those for public hearings if a property is zoned agricultural within the city and greater density is requested based upon the citys comprehensive plan an application for zoning district amendment under the procedures of article x of this chapter is required to establish a residential zoning district classification and residential density 2 plan approval required although the pd designation may be applied to parcels of land as a mapped zoning district it is the intent of this section that no development or redevelopment of property represented by the pd designation take place until an acceptable preliminary and final development plan has been reviewed and approved in conformance with the requirements of this section a planned development will involve subdivision of land  therefore the subdivision review and approval procedures contained in chapter 410 shall be administered any preexisting uses within the area encompassed by the pd designation shall have the status of nonconforming uses as outlined in article vi of this chapter until such time as they are included in an approved development plan 3 types of planned developments all areas of the city subject to the pd designation shall be assigned one of the following subclassifications that shall be considered a separate use district and be

severe limitations regarding topography tree cover wetlands floodplains soil conditions utility easements or unusual land shape or proportions for conventional development  or if it is determined that the use proposed is desirable or necessary in relationship to the surrounding neighborhood  or if the board of aldermen determines such waiver to be in the general public interest d permitted uses the use of land is considered an integral element of the proposed development plan approval of the proposed development by the board of aldermen carries with it approval of the various uses encompassed by it based upon this relationship the planning and zoning commission and the board of aldermen may require revisions to the proposed development plan as it relates to the proposed uses  or may require elimination from the plan of any use considered inappropriate based upon its relationship to other uses proposed in the plan surrounding existing land uses land uses featured in the comprehensive plan for the city or other factors demonstrating that based on sound planning principles the use is not compatible or appropriate in the area proposed uses of land shall be established by the ordinance adopted by the board of aldermen authorizing the pd planned development district uses of land which may be proposed within a development plan by pd subclassification are as follows subclassification requirement planned developmentresidential uses may include only those uses designated as permitted accessory or conditional uses in the r1a r1e singlefamily districts r2 twofamily district and r3

this section e density and area regulations and performance standards 1 general standards approval of the preliminary development plan may provide for regular exceptions from traditional zoning districts as may be necessary or desirable to achieve the objectives of the proposed planned development  provided however such exceptions must be consistent with the standards and criteria contained in this section and have been specifically requested in the application for a planned development  and further that no modification of the regulations contained herein would be allowed with the following results a inadequate or unsafe motor vehicle or pedestrian access or inadequate utility access within the planned development  b traffic volumes exceeding the anticipated capacity of the proposed major street network in the vicinity  c undue burden on public parks recreation areas schools fire and police protection and other public facilities which serve or are proposed to serve the planned development  d development which will be incompatible with the general purposes of this chapter  or e detrimental environmental or aesthetic impact on the surrounding area or individual lot

purpose as an alternative to the density and open space requirements of subsections e1 and 2 of this section a developer may choose to cluster or group the structures of an entire development or on a portion of an overall development so as to preserve a significant amount of the site as protected open or wooded space recreation areas or common area if the proposed development is within the medium density residential land use category and the developer chooses to have a portion of the development as a cluster the area to be clustered shall meet the minimum open space requirements as set forth in the clustering design standards while the gross open space for the entire development shall be a minimum of 35 percent the city encourages developers to investigate the clustering approach as it often can reduce the cost of development by reducing the amount of streets utilities and other improvements while simultaneously benefitting the environment by reducing impervious surface stormwater runoff protecting woodlands and otherwise preserving natural or other beneficial features and functions of the land b minimum required open space minimum required open space for a cluster development based upon city comprehensive land use map land use category minimum required open space low density residential 60% medium density residential 40% c application all applications for a cluster

4252018 chapter 410  subdivisions article i  in general purpose a land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development once land has been divided into streets blocks lots and open spaces a pattern has been established which usually determines how well the community needs for residence business and industry will be met it also determines to a great extent how well the community will be able to handle its traffic circulation problems how well it will be able to provide the main services demanded of it b after land has been subdivided and publicly recorded it is very difficult and costly to correct defects and deficiencies in the subdivision layout and in the facilities provided in addition a subdivided area sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided the welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects the guidance of land development in harmony with community objectives is therefore a matter of serious public concern and it is in the interest of the public the developer and the future owners that subdivisions be conceived designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards c the purpose of these regulations then is to control the division of land within the city

this article is to implement the land use objectives of the citys master plan that recognizes the importance of protecting the citys natural attributes and the importance of utilizing these natural attributes to retain and absorb stormwater runoff and prevent development practices that destroy these natural functions and threaten the health safety and general welfare of the citys residents the specific purposes of these standards are to 1 reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows slowing the velocity of floodwaters and regulating base flow  2 benefit the community in the following ways economically by minimizing encroachment on natural watercourses and the need for engineering solutions  by reducing property damage and threats to safety of watershed residents  by contributing to the scenic beauty and environment of the community and thereby preserving the character of the community  by improving the quality of life of its residents  and by increasing property values  3 stabilize the banks of watercourses to reduce bank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourses  4 provide infiltration of stormwater and runoff and reducing impervious surfaces  5 reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants already present in watercourses  6 restoring and maintaining the chemical physical and biological integrity of the water resources  7 provide quality watercourse habitats with shade and food to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation  8 furnish recreational opportunities  and 9 allow areas for natural watercourses to meander naturally reducing infrastructure and property damage    6242009 scope of application and requirements a application

of fact and purposes a statutory authorization the legislature of this state has in rsmo  delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the city ordains as follows b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and b the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods that are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles is based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in subsection b1 of this section  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d by applying the provisions of this chapter to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard  and 4 assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program        1132016 general provisions a lands to which chapter applies

representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare health of the inhabitants of the community and as specifically noted in section  b floodplain administrator the community development director is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator under this chapter c rules for interpretation of district boundaries the boundaries of the floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the flood insurance rate map or floodway map where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions the enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation in such cases where the interpretation is contested the board of adjustment will resolve the dispute the regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires d compliance no development located within the special flood hazard areas of this community shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations e abrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this chapter to repeal abrogate or impair any existent easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter imposes greater restrictions the provision of this chapter shall prevail all other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only f interpretation in their interpretation and application the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes g warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted with such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage this chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder h severability if any section clause provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of appropriate jurisdiction the remainder of this chapter shall not be affected thereby i appeal where a request for a

superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under subsection c of this section 2 the superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the
