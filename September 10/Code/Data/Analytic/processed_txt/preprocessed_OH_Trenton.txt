these codified ordinances is similar to that used in the ohio revised is consistent with general practice each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal the section number appears to the right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01 with this numbering system the codified ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly codes titles and chapters are initially even numbered thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as in the revised are the traffic and general offenses codes where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter in each are included as part of the sections newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66006 and precede 66007 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code subsections without histories or

aall regulations in this chapter shall control the general manner in which streets lots and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land these regulations shall help ensure the development of convenient and safe streets the creation of usable lots the provision of space for public utilities and the reservation of land for recreational uses the planning of attractive and functional neighborhoods shall be promoted in order to minimize the undesirable features of unplanned haphazard growth bsubdivisions are encouraged to take advantage of the topography of the land minimize the destruction of large trees as well as tree clusters minimize the disturbance of topsoil and preserve such natural features as watercourses sites of historical and archaeological significance and any other assets that if preserved will add attractiveness and value to the subdivision and community cthe subdivision review committee and the planning commission have the responsibility for reviewing the design of all future subdivisions early in their design development the subdivision review staff is also responsible for making sure that existing roads have the capacity to handle all new development in a safe and efficient manner if the city planning commission and subdivision review staff including the citys service director and chief of police determine that it is in the public interest they may require a traffic impact analysis to be completed at the developers expense any street improvements called for by this analysis which are the direct result of the proposed development shall also be made at the developers expense dall land to be subdivided must be submitted for approval all at one time so that the planning commission may better understand the full impacts of the proposed development and how the entire development relates to and impacts the city furthermore the planning commission needs to be able to see all utilities and proposed utilities in the entire area and how they may impact adjacent pieces of property passed 7202 120802 common open space athe subdivision layout shall conform to the citys master plan zoning any other officially adopted longrange plans for the city bwhere deemed appropriate by the planning commission open space consisting of 3% of total acreage proposed for development which is suitably located for future use as parks playgrounds andor other recreational purposes for local or neighborhood use shall be provided for in the proposed subdivision if such open space is not dedicated to the city it shall be reserved for the common use of all property owners in the proposed subdivision by covenant in individual deeds such open space shall be maintained and operated by the homeowners or property owners association passed 7202 120803 traffic impact analysis atraffic impact studies tis can be a valuable planning tool for the city a traffic impact study allows the city to better understand the impact a proposed development will have on adjacent roads intersections and site access driveways before the planning commission or city council approves the development this type of planning provides the ability to make modifications to the proposed plans andor plan for the mitigation of the traffic impact prior to the development being constructed bimportant questions that may be answered by a traffic impact study 1are the number of access points the minimal necessary to serve the project without negatively impacting the flow of traffic along arterial streets 2are the proposed access points a sufficient distance from intersections to minimize conflicts 3are proposed access points adequately spaced from other access points along the street 4should left turns be restricted by signs channeled driveways or the installation of a median 5have other methods of access such as shared driveways frontage roads or access off a side street been evaluated 6is the sight distance adequate at proposed access points 7are deceleration lanes necessary 8is the throat length at the driveway sufficient to minimize conflicts within the site 9can trucks and wastehauling vehicles easily access the site and circulate to and from loading areas 10is the design sensitive to pedestrian needs cthe traffic impact study guidelines presented in this section will perform the following functions 1establish standards of study  2ensure that important traffic concerns are addressed  3provide staff with a check list for the review process  4promote an increased understanding of traffic impact issues for those involved in the development process da full or partial traffic impact study will be required for any proposed development when the planning commission has determined after receiving input from the subdivision review staff that street capacity andor safety are concerns or when a proposed development will generate 100 or more added new peak hour trips to or from the site during the adjacent roadways peak hours or the developments peak hour ethe use of the 100vehicle threshold is reasonable because in an hour an additional 100 vehicles can 1change the level of service at an intersection  2require the addition of turn lanes to accommodate site traffic while not impacting   3lead to a need for additional traffic control measures such as stop signs blinking lights andor traffic signalization  4for residential developments 100 peak hour traffic trips are likely to be generated by a150 singlefamily detached homes  b245 apartments  c295 town home condominiums 5for

or capacity issue in the area of the proposed development may require a full or partial impact study for the following reasons 1high accident intersection or section of roadway  2proximity of proposed site drives to other site drives or intersections  3sensitivity of adjacent neighborhoods  4existing or projected level of service of streets adjacent to the proposed development which is unacceptable

manner such that no storm water shall be permitted to flow intersection 5sump pump lines no sump pump lines may be tied to the sanitary sewer or to the curb a separate pipe of 4 or 6inch diameter is to be run behind the back of the curb and tied into the nearest possible catch basin or storm manhole astandard ys or ts should be installed 10 feet from the property line on the downhill side of the lot and marked in the field cleanouts should be spaced approximately every 400 feet bno downspouts may be tied to the sump line all downspouts must be run separately to catch basins or released on splash blocks call sump pumps must be connected to the sump lines provided at the street bmajor system design 1general the intent of planning a flood routing system is to ensure that storm water runoff which exceeds the capacity of the storm sewer system shall have a route to follow in order to prevent a major loss of property or life aminimum opening elevations are to be set by the citys consulting engineer along all 100year flood routes these elevations are to be a minimum of 1 foot above the 100year floodwater elevation these elevations are to be clearly labeled on the plan and record plat bsince streets may be used as a routing path the major system must be taken into account in the initial design of the development it shall be designed in a manner that will direct the storm water into a detention or retention area 2capacity the combination of the major and minor system shall have the capacity to carry runoff from a 100year frequency storm awhere the street is designed as the major drainageway the depth of flow shall not exceed 8 inches at the face of the curb bwhen the major drainageway is located outside a street rightof way such as in a retention pond or detention basin easements shall be provided and a grading plan is to be submitted with detailed elevations showing the flood being contained in this area cculvert design 1technical release 55 and the

property owner must be obtained the backwater condition should be checked on the 50 year frequency storm 6a structure having a clear opening of 10 feet or more shall be classified as a bridge and subject to special conditions under the direction of the service director or other consultant that the city has hired for engineering advice 7entrance loss coefficient appropriate standard entrance coefficients are to be used in culvert design dopen channel design 1general any newly designed open channel shall only accommodate a small drainage area ie lot swale all other design drainage features shall be enclosed with storm sewer with the exception of large major channels 2design aopen channels are to be designed using a full flow 10year frequency storm unless the channel is part of the major storm system then it must be designed using a 100year storm frequency bspecial provisions such as a check or drop structure will be addressed on an individual basis cthe longitudinal slope of a channel should be 1% or greater any channel with a slope below 1% or with a small continuous flow must have a paved bottom or be under drained with a lowflow pipe all side slopes shall be 4 1 or flatter in residential areas and  or flatter in commercial and industrial areas unless otherwise approved by the citys engineering consultant 3permissible velocities the maximum permissible design velocity shall not be greater than the erodible velocity of the channel the velocity is to be calculated using a bank full condition or a minimum 10year frequency storm whichever is greater channel linings will be required as per the odot design manual in designing an open channel the low flow and grade shall be addressed as to prevent stagnation all seeding mulching and sodding shall be installed immediately after construction as per odot 659 and 660 and kept in ideal growth conditions until established edetention and retention 1introduction the objective of a detentionretention facility is to regulate the rate of runoff and control the peak discharges to reduce the impact on the downstream drainage system 2design criteria the allowable peak rate of runoff from the developed area shall not exceed a predeveloped 10year frequency storm the basin shall have capacity to store a postdeveloped 50year frequency storm from the same area 3design considerations the following considerations for maintenance and appearance of a detentionretention facility shall be taken into account in the design athe bottom of the detention area should be constructed with sufficient slopes to drain properly 05% minimum bpaved gutter or a low flow under drain shall be constructed from all inlet pipes to the outlet structure where two gutters intersect large radii shall be used so that the change in direction of flow is gradual cside slopes for detention facilities shall be no steeper than 4 1 unless existing natural conditions do not make this possible dantiseep collars shall be used on all pipe outlets of retention basins or ponds ethere shall be a minimum of 6 inches of freeboard between the top of the dike and the water surface in the reservoir with the emergency spillway
