sexuallyoriented businesses  561  findings intent and purpose a the council recognizes that some activities which occur in connection with sexuallyoriented businesses are protected as expression under

with full protection of those rights the council is aware however that sexuallyoriented businesses may and do generate secondary effects which are detrimental to the public health safety and welfare b among these secondary effects are 1 prostitution and other sexrelated offenses  2 drug use and dealing  3 health risks spread of aids and other sexually transmitted diseases  and 4 infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of drug and sex related business activities laundering of money and other illicit conduct c this article is not intended to interfere with legitimate expression but to avoid and mitigate the secondary effects enumerated above d 1 specifically the council finds that licensing of persons who operate and manage sexually oriented businesses and persons who provide adult services will further the goals of this article by enabling the city to ascertain if an applicant is underage or has engaged in criminal or other behavior of the sort this article is design to limit

nonconflicting parking demands eg a nightclub and a bank c a development is designed to take advantage of adjacent public transit opportunities 5 the amount of required parking may be reduced by up to 30% where it can be determined that the peak requirements of the several occupancies occur at different times and where a shared parking operations plan approved by the zoning administrator or
