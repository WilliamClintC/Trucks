occurrence of parties on private property where alcohol is served to or consumed by underage persons is harmful to the underage persons and a threat to public health safety quiet enjoyment of property and the general welfare of the communities where such parties are held b underage persons often obtain alcoholic beverages at parties held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial

have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to nor consumed by underage persons at these parties c control of parties on private property where underage persons are being served or consuming alcohol is necessary because such activity poses a threat to the peace health safety or general welfare of the public police ability to abate gatherings where alcohol is served to or consumed by underage persons on private property will result in a decrease in abuse of alcohol by underage persons physical altercations and injuries neighborhood vandalism and excessive noise disturbance thereby improving public safety d problems associated with such parties at which alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons are

disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources and cause a drain on staff leaving other areas of the city with inadequate protection f persons held responsible for abetting or tolerating

additional public facilities and type of development the city council is committed to maintaining the same level of public facilities and services and the same public facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on the date of the adoption of this order to ensure that to the extent city growth occurs in the future there will be the same level of public facilities and services that existed on said date the city council finds that a reasonable relationship exists between the need for additional public facilities equipment and operations and the type of development project for which the fee is imposed for the following reasons a the city council has determined that commercial and industrial developments result in a need for additional public services which in turn ultimately result in a need for additional government and public safety facilities and essential infrastructure and related facilities based on the level of public services and the public facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on the date of the adoption of this the extent to which commercial and industrial developments contribute to growth the city council determines that commercial and industrial development should be assessed at rates to be established by resolution of the said city council as the fair share of contribution for the costs of these required public facilities and services b the city council has determined that residential development including new mobile home park development results in significant increases in city population and that such residential development adversely affects the public facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on the date of the adoption of this city council has further determined that because residential development results in significant increases in population such development results in the need for additional government and public safety facilities essential infrastructure and related facilities and cultural and recreation facilities and public safety operational costs based on the public facilitiestopopulation relationship which existed on said date and the extent to which residential development contributes to the citys growth the city council determines that residential development shall be assessed at the rate established by resolution of the city council for the costs for these required public facilities and services  c the city council has determined that development agreements and assessment districts approved by the city provide for public improvements for which the expense is not provided for by the standard fees provided for in this title and for which a zone of benefit and schedule of special fees and charges are necessary to equitably charge the properties benefited by such improvements the zone of benefit and schedule of surcharge fees shall be established in essentially the same manner as provided in this no annual revision or determination is required beyond the initial establishment of such surcharge fees which may use the development agreement assessment proceedings or other similar contract and statutory proceedings as the basis for the costs reasonably borne provisions of of this title  1224 adjustment of fees the fees set forth herein shall be adjusted from time to time but not less than annually as of july 1 of each year subject to city council review and approval to reflect changes in costs as determined by the city manager and the department head staff  1225 relationship between amount of fees and cost of facilities attributable to development on which fee is imposed  sterling codifiers inc  428436 the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fees set by resolution of the city council and the cost of the public facilities or portions thereof attributable to the development on which the fees are imposed the basis for such determination is set out in reports to the city council from the city manager and such consultants as the city council determines is necessary to develop accurate costs and fees to cover such costs  1226 relationship between fees use and type
