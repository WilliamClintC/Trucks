sdus per acre all sdus to be planted must be located outside any natural b in order to encourage the protection of trees above and beyond the required 100 tdus shrub density requirements may be reduced by a similar area covered by the crz of the additional trees to be saved c as a healthy shrub eventually covers an area with a fivefoot diameter or 196 square feet the required sdus may be reduced by that area equal to 196 square feet or multiples thereof for example should a development save 110 caliper inches of existing tree stock per acre the applicant would receive credit for the additional ten inches this could be calculated as follows 1 determine the critical root zone crz of the tree to be saved a teninch tree would yield a 15foot crz 2 square the crz 225 square feet 3 multiply the product of step 2 by 314  pi  this determines the healthy growing area of the tree to be saved or 7065 square feet 4 divide the result of step 3 by 196   36 sdus 5 the number derived in step 4 is the allowable reduction in sdus  2 102104 highway buffer a a landscaped buffer shall be established parallel to the entire front of the property along the state highways 85 54 92 314 and

determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure safeguard the public health safety environment and general welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources this division seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable coordinate site design plans which include greenspace with the countys greenspace protection plan  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained and pose no threat to public safety  and 7 establish

that premarking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage the procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where white lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked b purpose the purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation white lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time this technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately in short premarking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate c examples  timing examples of areas to be white lined are smaller involving only a portion of a particular address or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines service lines such as for water gas electricity and sewer utility pits cuts and repairs curb repairs bore holes directional boring pathways pole and signage placements etc such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive white lining shall be completed prior to contacting ga811 to obtain a locate request ticket number electronicvirtual
