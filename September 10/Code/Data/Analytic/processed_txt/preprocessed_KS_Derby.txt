supplement 8 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each

the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 8 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a

moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example can be added between section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with supplement no 8 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end these history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index statutory references

codified the chapter or chapters will be indicated example 204 612 904 if the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified such as budgets taxes annexations or rezones the disposition will be special if the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code usually at the direction of the municipality the disposition will be not codified other dispositions

of derby has determined that the regulation of public nudity and adult cabarets and adult entertainment establishments hereafter collectively referred to as sexually oriented business activities as these terms are hereafter defined will protect the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city and will minimize the secondary effects associated with such activities  and whereas based upon the legislative findings discussed herein and recent court cases recognizing the secondary effects of public nudity and sexually oriented business activities and the citys familiarity with the problems associated with these secondary effects within sedgwick county and other areas throughout the country the city finds that the continued regulation of public nudity and sexually oriented business activities furthers the goal of protecting the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city of derby and minimizes the secondary effects of such activities  and whereas the city of derby desires to minimize and control these secondary effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry  to protect citizens from increased crime  to preserve the quality of life  to preserve property values  to preserve the character of the city of derbys neighborhoods and to deter the spread of blight  and whereas the city of derby has an important governmental interest in combating the secondary effects associated with public nudity and sexually oriented business activities and has the constitutional power to combat these secondary effects  and whereas as summarized below the city of derby has reviewed and analyzed numerous reports studies judicial decisions and the experience and legislative findings of other counties and municipalities around the country concerning the impacts or secondary effects of public nudity and sexually oriented business activities on the areas in which such activities are located or take place  and whereas the supreme court of the united states has held in city of renton v playtime theaters inc that cities may rely on relevant studies and evidence from other cities as the basis for action taken to ensure the public order and combat the secondary effects associated with public nudity and sexually oriented business activities  and whereas the supreme court of the united states has held in barnes v glen theatre inc and city of erie v paps am tdba candyland that a governing body may prohibit nudity in public places to combat these secondary effects  and whereas the supreme court of the united states in city of los angeles v alameda books inc reaffirmed its earlier holdings that a municipal government may permissibly regulate the negative secondary effects associated with sexually oriented business activities  and whereas the tenth circuit court of appeals in cases such as heideman v south salt lake city has continued to recognize the negative secondary effects as summarized below created by sexually oriented business activities  and whereas public nudity and sexually oriented business activities can cause or contribute significantly to increases in criminal activity in the areas in which they are located including increased incidents of unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and inappropriate intimate conduct between sexually oriented business employees and patrons violent acts such as assault and battery sexual harassment unlawful drug activities and disorderly conduct thereby taxing crime prevention and law enforcement resources  and whereas sexually oriented business

within such neighborhoods and can inhibit the proper maintenance and growth of such neighborhoods limiting or reducing the availability of quality affordable housing for area residents and reducing the value of property in such areas  and whereas public nudity and sexually oriented business activities can undermine the stability of other established business and commercial uses in the areas in which sexually oriented business activities occur and can cause or contribute significantly to the deterioration of such other businesses and commercial uses thereby causing or contributing to a

sexually oriented business activities can have a distracting influence on minors and students attending schools can diminish or destroy the enjoyment and family atmosphere of persons using parks playgrounds and other public recreational areas and can interfere with or even destroy the spiritual experience of persons attending church synagogue or other places of worship  and whereas the presence of sexually oriented business activities is perceived by the public generally and by neighboring business owners and residents as an indication that the area and the quality of life in the area in which such activities occur is in decline and deteriorating a perception that can lead quickly to such decline and deterioration prompting businesses and residents to flee the affected area to avoid the consequences of such decline and deterioration  and whereas the conduct of sexually oriented business activities including specifically but without limitation the operation and use of adult booths and similar establishments often encourages or allows sexual activities that place employees and patrons of such businesses at risk to exposure and contraction of sexually transmitted diseases including specifically but without limitation the hiv virus acquired immune deficiency syndrome and venereal diseases  and whereas public nudity can increase crime especially crimes of a sexual nature increase risk of public exposure to sexually transmitted diseases and other pathogens borne by human blood and bodily fluids and can cause the degradation of the aesthetic and commercial character of

county commissioners meeting  and whereas the city has determined that public nudity and sexually oriented business activities will unless properly regulated have these and other severe adverse impacts and secondary effects on the city and its residents  and whereas the city has determined that the regulations within this chapter on the operation maintenance and other aspects of sexually oriented business activities and the prohibition of public nudity are necessary to minimize to the greatest extent possible or to eliminate altogether the public health risks that customarily exist in connection with such activities  and whereas the city has also determined that the regulations within this chapter including but not limited to the licensing and distance requirements for sexually oriented business activities as well as the prohibition on public nudity are necessary in order to achieve the goal of combating the secondary effects described above associated with public nudity and

fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of derby kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter the base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a onepercent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to

planned unit development district is a special purpose base line zoning district the pud district is not defined as an overlay district and is not granted in conjunction with other baseline or underlying zoning districts future development within the pud district is based on a site development plan or map that depicts the general layout of the future land use types planned to be developed within the pud along with written text that explains and details the developmental layout a residential planned unit development district 1 statement of intent the purpose of the residential planned unit development pud district is to provide well planned cohesive and unified residential developments for properties held under unified control at the time of initial residential pud approval in order to achieve this purpose the residential pud review process recognizes there may be a need to establish controls not typically required of nonunified or residential developments that are not planned as an integrated unit the review process also recognizes that in order to provide greater design flexibility for unified residential developments it may be necessary to deviate from 1 the bulk and lot area requirements typical of the common base line residential zoning districts and 2 the requirements of the landscaping section of these regulations as well as 3 the design and improvement standards of the citys subdivision regulation for purposes of these regulations unified residential developments are defined as the grouping of building sites planned as an integrated unit or cluster on property under unified control or ownership at the time the residential pud district was approved by the city the sale subdivision or other partition of the site after residential pud approval does not exempt the project or portions thereof from complying with the development standards committed to at the time of residential pud approval the submittal by the developer and the approval by the city of development plans represent a firm commitment by the developer that development will indeed follow the approved plans in concept intensity of use and quantities of open space the protection of public safety convenience health and general welfare is accomplished for a residential pud review of the size shape orientation and location of differing residential land use types or densities relative to the entire tract of land subject to the residential pud district the purposes to be achieved by such a review is to ensure that future residential uses are provided a proper ingress and egress from adjacent street rightsofway relative to anticipated traffic demand  b sufficient land area for onsite storm water detention areas and other drainage facilities needed to serve the residential development in compliance with all applicable federal state and local laws rules regulations ordinances resolutions policies procedures and permits  zoning regulations zoning districts 4  116 c sufficient land area for common open space and recreational facilities to serve the residential development  d adequate land area to accomplish effective screening and landscaping from adjacent properties and  or street rightsofway of the planned residential development  the residential pud district is intended to encourage 1 innovation in residential development by permitting greater variety and flexibility in type design and layout of dwellings 2 more efficient use of land by reflecting changes in the technology of residential land development 3 development which incorporates the best features of modern residential design while conserving the value of land and 4 planned residential developments that are designed in a manner that will produce more usable open space better recreational opportunities and safer and more attractive neighborhoods than under conventional residential zoning and development techniques provided however items 1 shall be considered as guidelines only and not as mandates or requirements of a pud application other reasonable concepts of innovative and creative development design can be considered as such the residential pud district provides a developer with the latitude of using innovative techniques in the development of residential uses not feasible under application of conventional residential zoning requirements the residential pud district is intended to provide a procedure that relates the type design and layout of residential development to the particular site and particular demand for housing in a manner consistent with the public health safety andor welfare the layout and character of the development subject to a residential pud district must be appropriate relative to surrounding properties and conditions as such safeguards or conditions for future development may be established as a part of the residential pud district to ensure that the development will minimize negative impacts if any to the value of surrounding property and its enjoyment by its owners or occupants the design of a residential pud district must be such that access and circulation by firefighting equipment and other emergency vehicles are assured and are not retarded by heavy or extensive landscaping walls or fences or building spacing 2 standards for residential planned unit developments pud the following regulations shall apply to property intended for residential development which is zoned the residential pud district a ownership the entire tract of land to be established as a pud shall be held by a single

residential pud district may provide for a greater number of dwelling units per gross acre than would be permitted by the common base line residential zoning districts otherwise applicable to the site if the proposed number of dwelling units per gross acre for the entire residential pud exceeds the density permitted by the applicable common base line residential districts the residential pud applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning commission and governing body that the increased density or intensity of use will not have an undue or adverse impact on public facilities and will not interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring properties by their owners and  or occupants in the case of a common base line zoning districts which does not permit residential uses the dwelling units per gross acre calculation shall be based on the density permitted by the r1 single family residential district when calculating the maximum residential density permitted under conventional r1 zoning the number of dwelling units permitted per gross acre shall be 352 when evaluating a proposal for increased residential density for a residential pud or specific residential pud parcel the planning commission and governing body shall review the proposal relative to the following i areas being established for common or private recreational amenities such as golf courses or homeowner association owned neighborhood swimming pools tennis courts and playgrounds  ii areas being established for perpetual common open space that are of a character size and shape

accommodated by the provision of recreational amenities and  or perpetual open space the planning commission and governing body may deny the proposed density increase any common open space established as a result of a decision to increase the residential development density of a residential pud or specific residential pud parcel shall be set aside for the perpetual use benefit and enjoyment of the residents of the residential pud district as a condition of residential pud approval the planning commission and  or governing body shall require the applicant to provide for the establishment of an agency that will own and maintain the common open space such agency shall not be dissolved or permitted to dispose of any common open space established to permit a residential pud to develop to a density greater than that permitted under conventional residential zoning by sale or otherwise except to a new agency assuming all the duties and obligations of the original agency if the agency fails to maintain such common open space or improperly disposes of the open space or if the applicant fails to establish the agency such action or actions shall be considered a violation of these regulations and subject to the penalties and  or remedies set forth in of these regulations 2 decreased density a residential pud district may be used to achieve and assure in perpetuity less dense residential development than would be permitted or assured by the common base line residential districts otherwise applicable to the site the location size and shape of a residential pud or

the following i the effect that reduced density and its proposed layout will have on the future development of adjacent properties according to conventional zoning and subdivision design and improvement practices  ii the effect that reduced density and its proposed layout will have on the citys ability to provide public services and infrastructure in a cost effect fashion  and iii the existence of either natural or manmade topographical features that reduce the capacity of land to support conventional residential densities such areas include floodplains areas subject to an aircraft noise exposure that is equal to or greater than 70 dnl and areas with infrastructure constraints zoning regulations zoning districts 4  119 if because of decreased residential density infrastructure design and improvement standards are proposed to be modified the residential pud applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the planning commission and governing body that modified

provides sufficient detail by which the planning commission can determine that the intent of these requirements is being satisfied while it is not the intent of the city to restrict design freedom unduly when reviewing project architecture in connection with a site and building plan it is in the best interest of the city to promote high standards of architecture design and compatibility with surrounding structures and neighborhoods in that regard the following policy statements and design criteria shall be used as guidelines in the preparation of required site and building plans 1
