general references  village of albion ny ecode360  13376 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n 1 2 a ethics  see ch 25 grievance procedure  see ch 35 officers and employees  see ch 55 personnel policies  see ch 61  261 endorsement of policy the village of albion endorses the policy of progressive discipline normal steps in this process are oral warning written warning suspension from duty and finally discharge the policy of progressive discipline does not necessarily apply for a number of the more serious violations or offenses where immediate discharge in line with due process may be required  262 determining proper discipline a basic principle underlying progressive disciplinary procedures is that the supervisor must have just cause for imposing the discipline just cause means that the supervisor has the right to discipline when an employee does not comply with rules or performance standards this excludes disciplinary action for mere whim or caprice this standard is used in judging whether the supervisor acted fairly in enforcing rules and regulations the following questions should be answered when contemplating a disciplinary action was the rule or order reasonably related to the efficient and safe operation of village government what was the rule intended to accomplish if the rule were observed as written would the purpose be realized was the rule realistic easy to understand was the rule out of date can the rule as written be complied with under the present circumstances are the penalties too light too severe do the people orating under the rule consider the penalties as being just are the penalties being enforced if enforcement has been lax in the past management shouldnt reverse its course and begin to crack down without first warning employees of its intent do all the people affected by the rule know the rule was it brought to their attention periodically as far as practical do all people affected know the why of the rule was the rule affecting groups that do not need it should the rule be extended to cover groups not now affected by it were certain groups allowed to violate the rule without incurring the penalties was the employee adequately warned of the consequences of hisher conduct the warning may be given orally or in printed form an exception may be made for certain conduct such as  village of albion ny ecode360  14376 3 4 5 a b c 6 a b c d 7 b insubordination drinking on the job stealing or using village property or other actions so serious that the employee is expected to know it will be punishable did management investigate before administering the discipline an investigation should be made before the decision to discipline is made was the investigation fair and objective witnesses should be interviewed their statements recorded and a careful investigation made to see that both sides of the story are available and fairly presented did the investigation produce substantial evidence of the infraction it is not required that the evidence be preponderant conclusive or beyond reasonable doubt except where the alleged misconduct is of such criminal or reprehensive nature as to stigmatize the employee and seriously impair hisher chances for future employment are there mitigating or aggravating circumstances mitigating circumstances for example refusal to obey an order because the employee had received contrary orders from another supervisor justify a lesser penalty aggravating circumstances for example prior violations of the same rule justify a more severe penalty some points to review when determining mitigating or aggravating circumstances include prior conduct record this refers to any formal disciplinary reprimands or suspensions penalties generally become more severe for each instance of misconduct length of service period of time since last penalty a long period of good conduct following previous disciplinary action should be considered since it represents the aim of corrective discipline disciplinary action that occurred more than two years to three years previous generally is of little value determining the current level of discipline in contemplating the dismissal of an employee you might want to ask yourself these questions does the employee have the skills required for the job is it possible that the content of hisher job has changed since originally hired is hisher attitude towards the job so negative that it is not only affecting hisher performance but also that of other individuals in the group have you attempted to motivate himher to improve performance by setting mutually acceptable work objectives observing the workers progress and conducting performance evaluations over short intervals after considering the above seven questions the supervisor should have an indication of the seriousness of the problem and what sort of disciplinary action would be proper  263 probationary employees the probationary period for original appointees is generally 180 days the minimum probationary period is eight weeks civil service rules require that probationary employees be advised from time to time of their status termination may be made for any rational reason including doubts about the employees capabilities a termination notice see hiring policy must be in writing and must be given at least one week prior to

appears to be a likely subject for disciplinary action interrogation must be done privately under the following guidelines no employee who is represented by a union shall be required to submit to an interrogation unless the employee is notified in advance of hisher right to have representation present an employee shall not be coerced intimidated or suffer any reprisals either directly or
