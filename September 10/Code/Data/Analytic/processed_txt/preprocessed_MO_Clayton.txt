found in the corridor to the maximum extent feasible a the westwood corridor is home to a variety of lot sizes and configurations many of the lots offer limited opportunities for flexibility in

additional coverage towards the rear of the lot without creating negative visual impacts city code of primary structure a7 4272004 preservation a8 4272004   the shady canopy provided by mature trees is an important characterdefining feature in many of claytons older residential neighborhoods this is particularly true in the clayton gardens and clayshire where large evenly spaced trees line the

corridor is its thoughtful treatment of offstreet parking most of the structures provide underground offstreet parking that is visually and functionally integrated with the structure as a result broad lawns and shade trees border most buildings rather than the unsightly exposed parking lots typically found with many more modern multifamily developments new development should provide offstreet

the westwood corridor has traditionally been dominated by the use of masonry building materials standard size brick in predominantly red tones is the primary material found accent materials are more

currently fairly uniform ranging from two 2 to three and onehalf 3 stories tall with fairly blocky rectangular or u shaped configurations oriented towards the street or a center lawn or courtyard surrounding development ranges from blocky midrise development along hanley to a range of two to threestory single and multifamily dwellings in the moorelands neighborhood to the east the height and mass of new development should respond to both surrounding development and adjacent development within the corridor subtle articulation of the wall surface with design elements such as a soldier

building heights may stepup from 3 stories or 45 feet to a maximum of 5 stories or 65 feet beyond 20 feet from the front setback 2 articulation of the wall surface shall be required this may be accomplished by a change in the brick pattern or the addition of stone detailing a though fairly simple in their overall form generally rectangular or u shaped with gently pitched roof lines or pediment walls the structures found in the westwood corridor have many subtle architectural details that add to their character a wide variety of decorative windows add visual interest they range from groupings of multipaned windows or doublehung windows to some more ornate accent windows such as city code leaded or stained glass stone sills headers or casings further enhance many of the windows also significant are the many welldefined entryways typically above the grade of the sidewalk many have elegant curving staircases ornamental railing or stone retaining walls leading to the entrance

the christian brothers campus preserves the existing character of the structures and is compatible with the established homes in the surrounding neighborhood in terms of architectural character scale and design due to the uncertainty surrounding a future use for the campus these standards provide three 3 potential development scenarios the first 1st scenario assumes the site will be redeveloped and integrated into the existing neighborhood with structures of a similar scale the standards address the basic contextual tools for accomplishing this scenario such as setbacks height and materials this scenario would maintain very little of the existing open character of the campus the second 2nd scenario acknowledges that redevelopment of the campus could occur at a higher intensity than the surrounding neighborhood perhaps with the addition of more buildings similar in height and scale to the brothers residence along university or the original school building along clayton road the final concept assumes the campus would be maintained as an institutional use such as an educational facility the latter two 2 concepts would have the potential to maintain more of the existing open character of the campus due to a more clustered building configuration a connection campus is provided by the extension of alamo in all three 3 scenarios many of the standards would be applicable in all three 3 scenarios such as those provided for materials architectural detailing and parking in cases where it was simply not realistic to predict the specifics of future development scenarios a

protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method

post construction storm water control of fact 15100 3132007 15101 3132007 a land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologics of local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition this storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of storm water runoff from development sites b the metropolitan st louis sewer district msd has established a set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all development in the msd service area including the city of clayton to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it has been determined that the regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety a the purpose of this to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within the city of clayton which is included in the msd service area in general the city of clayton seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 minimize increases in storm water runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding siltation and erosion  2 minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by storm water runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality  and 3 reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever possible water management controls and to ensure that these
