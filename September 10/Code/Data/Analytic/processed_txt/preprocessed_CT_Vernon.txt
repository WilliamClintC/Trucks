section is to provide greater residential development flexibility particularly where a site has an unusual lot line or natural resource configuration of where rear lot development would promote or enhance the protection of valuable natural resource features this section is not intended to encourage development of land characterized by severe or very severe development limitations or to discourage new development and is limited to residential construction  no approval shall be granted authorizing construction on rear lots unless the applicants for such permits have demonstrated compliance with all of the following conditions to the satisfaction of the commission 1 that such lot or lots provide the best development of the land considering subject lot and lot configurations

natural resources configuration accessibility and topography and  the rear lots shall not present any problems with the provision of emergency services and  all the requirements of the zoning andor subdivision regulations are met aquifer protection 201  in establishing these regulations the town recognizes that  the groundwater underlying this town is a significant source of its present and

buildings erected in any neighborhood adversely affect the desirability of the immediate area and the neighboring areas for residential business or other purposes  it is the policy of the design review advisory committee that it will seek improvements in design rather than practice censorship of creativity it is not the charge of the committee to review projects for compliance with building codes or fire safety codes 212  criteria for plan evaluation  the committee will consider the general criteria outlined below to review the following 1 the basic design for the proposed uses buildings or development  2 the relationship between the buildings and the land and the physical environment  3 the relationship between uses and buildingstructures  and 4 the overall physical appearance of the proposed usebuildingsdevelopment and its compatibility with surrounding development and the neighborhood  specific criteria for plan evaluation  the purpose of these criteria is to establish a checklist of those items that affect the physical aspect of vernons environment pertinent to appearance is the design of the site building and structures plantings signs lighting and other objects that are observed by the public  these criteria are not intended to restrict imagination innovation or variety but rather to assist in focusing on design principles which can result in creative solutions that will develop a satisfactory visual appearance within the town  the criteria are 1 impact on the market value of existing structures in the adjoining area  2 impact on the historic significance of the site and the affected area  3 compatibility with the plan of development of the town  4 types styles and colors of building materials exterior facades and facing and fenestration

telecommunication sites 231  background and purpose recent advances in wireless communications technology have resulted in a new generation of telecommunication services these new services transmit radio waves of such a frequency and power that will likely require numerous antenna locations these antennas may be located on buildings water towers and other similar structures but will also frequently be located on new or enlarged towers this requires that the town of vernon regulate these wireless communication system facilities in a different manner than conventional television and radio transmission towers which are able to transmit their signals at much greater distances a number of providers of wireless communication services have recently been licensed by the federal communications commission and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the near future these firms are expected to pursue antenna sites within the town of vernon and these efforts are expected to include requests to construct new communication towers and antennas the intent of the regulation is to provide for the establishment andor expansion of cellular telephone mobile radio and personal communication systems within the town of vernon while protecting neighborhoods and minimizing the adverse visual and operational effects of wireless telecommunication facilities design siting and screening more specifically this regulations has been developed in order to  maximize use of existing and approved towers and other structures to accommodate new antennas and transmitters in order to reduce the number of communication towers needed to serve the community  encourage providers to colocate their facilities on a single site   site facilities below visually prominent ridge lines   minimize the location of facilities in visually sensitive areas   encourage creative design measures to camouflage facilities   protect historic and residential areas from potential adverse impacts of communication towers   avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure careful siting of tower structures 232  location preferences the locations for siting the equipment involved in
