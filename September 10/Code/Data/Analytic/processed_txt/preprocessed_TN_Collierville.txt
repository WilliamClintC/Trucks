guidelines for the siting design and operation of wireless communications facilities wcf due to the unique characteristics or potential impacts of these facilities on surrounding property wcf require individual consideration of their design appearance andor configuration at the particular location proposed such individual consideration may also call for the imposition of individualized conditions in order to ensure that the facility is appropriate at a particular location 2goals the goals of this division are to aestablish clear and objective standards for the placement design and continuing maintenance of wcf  bpromote the availability of universal wireless communications to all town residents businesses and visitors  c minimize the adverse visual aesthetic and structural safety impacts of wcf on the community  dencourage the design of wcf to be as aesthetically and architecturally compatible as possible with the surrounding natural and built environments  eencourage colocation of wcf on existing support structures to minimize the number of new facilities required  fencourage users of antennas to locate them to the extent possible on existing structures such as lighting towers power transmission line towers water towers or buildings and encourage users of towers to locate them to the extent possible in nonresidential areas where the adverse impact on the community is reduced  gwhen it is determined by substantial data that no alternate location of a tower is possible other than in a residential area require that an applicant employ alternate tower sometimes referred to as stealth design designs or locations such as modified clock towers church spires flag poles or building modifications  hcomply with applicable federal and state rules and regulations as to accommodate the provision of a broad range of wireless communications in a safe effective and efficient manner  and iensure that regulations do not constitute a barrier to entry and apply to wireless communications providers on a competitively neutral basis 3site selection policies in order to accomplish the above goals and to protect and promote the public health safety and welfare the town will use the following order of preference in siting wireless communications antennas and towers awithin any district sites should be located in the following order of preference 1colocation of

regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the town and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the town the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material bfindings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the board of mayor and aldermen board and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976 and barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991 and on studies in other communities including

newport news virginia  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  oklahoma city oklahoma ii  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  seattle washington  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the board finds 1sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises  2certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments  3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows  4offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions  5persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses  6at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections  7since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states  600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 1985 and 253448   8as of  there were 7689 reported cases of aids and 3904 deaths resulting from aids in the state of tennessee there were 2522 reported cases of aids in shelby county as of   9since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in the state of tennessee with 9363 reported cases of hiv there were 3651 reported cases of hiv in shelby county as of   10the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 there were 934 reported cases of early syphilis in shelby county in 1997 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 there were 4876 reported cases of gonorrhea in shelby county in 1997  11the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn  12according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts  13sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities  14numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films  15the findings noted in subsections 1 14 raise substantial governmental concerns  16sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  17a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurance that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein  18removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters  19requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments  20the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  21it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity  22the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter  23the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases  24the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter
