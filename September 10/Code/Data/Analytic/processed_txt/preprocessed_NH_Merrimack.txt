designed in accordance with generally accepted engineering practices rules and regulations of the new hampshire department of environmental services the new hampshire department of transportation drainage manual and these regulations a roadway storm drain system may be a closed system an open system or a combination of the two it is the intent of these regulations that system engineers be aware of the following considerations when drainage systems are being designed 1 extensive open drainage swales and holding basins often become the responsibility of the town to maintain and constitute a significant expense to taxpayers roadside channels shall be designed in accordance with federal highway administration design procedures publication hec 15design of roadside channels with flexible liningsoctober 1975 2 closed systems increase the velocity of flow and have the potential for increased erosion and flooding near the outfall while good engineering practices can mitigate this potential demand for water quality requires flow along a grassed swale prior to outfall into any wetland or water body 3 under conditions of severe topography contractors have on occasion not been able to construct the highway and the approved open drainage swales within the 50foot right of way leading to problems of easement acquisition or to property owners holding clear title to part of the swale in an effort to avoid these or similar problems in the road construction it is expected that the drainage system engineer will carefully consider the relative fiscal impacts of the proposed system and design a system that will impose the least longterm maintenance costs and will preserve the highest level of water quality that is reasonably attainable therefore the planning board reserves the right to judge the adequacy of the drainage system based upon these criteria b a storm drainage system either open or closed including swales headwalls culverts catch basins and storm drains shall be designed by a registered civil engineer 414 calculations shall be done to a positive outfall where the board anticipates that the additional runoff incident to the proposed subdivision

statement on the plan i certify that i have followed the town of merrimacks subdivision regulations as set forth in storm drainage system furthermore in my professional opinion any runoff incident to

buffer areas and other required landscaping can be maintained with minimal care and the need for watering pesticide or fertilized use is minimized for these reasons native species and species that have long thrived within the merrimack area are preferred since such plant species are well adapted to the local environment b to avoid maintenance problems soil testing should be conducted prior to planting to ensure that the appropriate plant varieties are selected for various portions of a site c to avoid maintenance problems and excessive watering organic matter such as compost or peat should be added the soil before planting as appropriate to increase the water holding capacity and of the soil and to provide nutrients d where used irrigation systems should be installed with moisture meters or other devices designed to avoid unnecessary or excessive watering alternatively irrigation systems should be manually activated 107 6 informal regrowth and peripheral landscape areas disturbed areas intended for natural regrowth should be at a minimum graded loamed and seeded with wildflowers perennial rye grass or similar varieties the planting of native trees shrubs and other plant varieties is encouraged the planting of lilac blueberry forsythia rhododendron and other hardy shrubs along the edge of cleared woodlands provides for an attractive transition between natural

districts are characterized by a wide variety of architectural styles and include numerous smallscale retail and business establishments shopping centers multifamily complexes and individual singlefamily dwellings these areas are generally automobileoriented though pedestrian accommodations are desired due to the large number of residences located in and around the districts it is also noteworthy that a number of buildings and sites of historic importance are located within these areas along with newer construction given the diverse character of the transitional areas no dominant architectural theme is contemplated rather an emphasis should be placed on building design and site layouts that are in harmony with surrounding uses and serve to bridge the wide stylistic gaps
