standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with  183022d and e b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with tennessee rule 1200414065 d when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that johnson city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the 1827 determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director johnson city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in  183022dia e below i to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits ii an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent 20% from its baseline production rates determined in subsection 2dic of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 1828 d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 2dia of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit iii when developing equivalent mass limits the director a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to  183026 the industrial user must also be in compliance with  183133 regarding the prohibition of bypass e the director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the director f once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this  183022 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived g many categorical pretreatment standards specify one 1 limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or four 4 day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation h any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the director within two 2 1829 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate 3 state pretreatment standards users must comply with state pretreatment standards as found in tennessee rule 12000414 4 local limits a the director is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to tennessee rule 1200414053 b the director shall establish a policy granting industrial users concentration based limits based on the allowable headworks loadings as periodically revised the policy shall be developed to equitably distribute the available mass loading for each drainage basin  allow for a reasonable percentage in reserve for future industrial users  and allow for a reasonable safety factor to protect against pass interference c the director may develop best management practices bmps by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits to implement local limits and the requirements of  183021 5 johnson citys right of revision the city of johnson city reserves the right to establish by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits or in general permits more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the potw consistent with the purpose of this chapter 6 dilution no user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement the director may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate 7 requirements for proper wastewater disposal a it

error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 1859 b an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection c below are met c a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that i an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  ii the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and iii the user has submitted the following information to the director within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five 5 days a a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  b the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and c steps being taken andor planned

have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards f users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails 2 prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in  183021a of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in  183021biii xix of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 1860 b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when johnson city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements 3 bypass a for the purposes of this section i bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility ii severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c and d of this section c bypass notifications i if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the director at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible ii a user shall submit oral notice to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the director may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours d bypass i bypass is prohibited and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have 1861 been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under subsection c of this section ii the director may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the director determines that it will meet the three 3 conditions listed in subsection di of this section 1985  as replaced by #440711 aug

system shall be classified into two 2 general classes or categories depending on the users contribution of wastewater loads the classes are defined in general terms the director may decide to select the class for a user 1862 based on loading conditions not specifically defined each class user is identified as follows a class i or domestic those users whose average bod demand is two hundred milligrams per liter 200 mgl by weight or less and whose suspended solids discharge is two hundred milligrams per liter 200 mgl by weight or less b class ii or nondomestic those users whose bod demand

fees may be made at any time in the fiscal year at the discretion of the director with the approval of the board of commissioners c all users shall pay a single unit charge expressed as dollars per thousand of gallons $1000 gallons purchased the rate shall be the total cost to pay debt service operate and maintain the potw divided by the total volume of wastewater from all users per year as determined from one 1 fiscal year to the next d the volume of water purchased which is used in the calculation of sewer use charges may be adjusted by the director if a user purchases a significant volume of water for consumptive use and does not discharge it to the public sewer such as filling swimming pools industrial heating and humidifying equipment etc the user shall be responsible for documenting the quantity of waste discharged to the potw and applying for a reduction e all class ii users shall pay a surcharge rate on the excessive amounts of pollutants discharged in direct proportion to the actual discharge quantities the surcharges include but are not limited to any pollutant that increases the costs of operating and maintaining the potw the surcharge cost shall be determined by multiplying the volume of wastewater discharged by the difference between the actual and maximum discharge pollutant concentrations the pollutant mass discharged is then multiplied by the cost to treat the pollutant 5 other surcharge fees if it is determined by the city that the discharge of other loading parameters or wastewater substances are creating excessive operation and maintenance costs within the wastewater system 1863 whether collection or treatment then the monetary effect of such a parameter or parameters shall be borne by the dischargers of such parameters in proportion to the amount of discharge 1985  as replaced by #440711 aug 2011 18315 private domestic wastewater disposal 1 availability a where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the

commissioners of the city of johnson city wishes to maintain eligibility in the national flood insurance program and in order to do so must meet the nfip regulations found in title 44 of the federal regulations cfr ch 1 subsequent amendments 2 areas of johnson city are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 3 these flood losses are primarily caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods  or construction which is inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  purpose it is the purpose of the floodplain regulations to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas the floodplain regulations are designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or erosion hazards or which cause damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including community facilities to be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which accommodate flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  6 protect karst drainage systems from sedimentation and debris  and 7 protect groundwater resources from contamination due to pollution runoff into karst drainage systems  objectives the objectives of the floodplain regulations are 1 to protect human life and health and property  2 to minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone sewer lines streets and bridges located in flood prone areas  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize blight in flood areas  7 to ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodable area  and 8 to maintain eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program 82  general provisions  basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard the areas of

sinkhole systems as such these sinkhole systems must remain available for the temporary storage and drainage of surface runoff in a manner similar to established riparian floodways and floodplains sinkhole areas are also known to be unstable for construction and drainage structures placed on soil foundations in sinkhole areas may be subject to flooding settling or collapse all sinkholes are herein defined to have 25year nobuild and 100year floodplain line locations and elevations which will restrict or modify development adjoining or draining to sinkholes some of these locations and elevations have been established by the city as part of its master planning or sinkhole investigation process for those sinkholes that have not been evaluated a person developing contiguous to or within the watershed draining to such sinkholes shall establish these elevations in accordance with the procedures described herein it is not possible to determine a generalized rule for sinkhole capacity each sinkhole behaves differently from all other sinkholes and the discharge from each is a function of unknown subterranean stream configurations sinkholes must not be used as an integral part of the drainage system unless no other outlet is feasible as shown in a study by a licensed professional with expertise in karst topography the location of structures surrounding sinkholes shall be regulated more strict requirements may be imposed if analysis demonstrates the possibility of water backing up sinkhole sinkholes are also known to be part of fragile drainage systems any substance or object including construction siltation placed within a sinkhole has the potential of clogging the throat of the sinkhole andor polluting groundwater the immediate area surrounding a sinkhole must be disturbed as little as possible extreme care should be taken in planning constructing and operating such land uses as may store and handle potential groundwater pollutants such as gas stations or in the design and construction of septic systems  purpose the purposes of the sinkhole policy are to supplement the policies established in the floodplain regulations to protect existing and future development from flooding due to sinkhole overflow and backup to protect underground drainage systems from clogging due to sediment and debris to protect the structural integrity of buildings and roads built near sinkholes and to work with the state of tennessee to protect groundwater resources from contamination due to pollutant runoff into sinkholes  applicability this policy shall be applicable to all areas of the city which drain either partially or totally to a sinkhole or underground karst system and which involves alterations to existing developments the construction of new developments disruption of the vegetative covering for land clearing activities topographic alterations or utility construction projects  permit procedures application for a development permit shall

structures  b all plans and corresponding calculations shall be produced by a licensed professional having expertise in karst topography  c if the site relies on any sinkholes for any portion of its drainage a hydrogeologic study will be required as part of the grading and drainage plan  d for those sinkholes that have been previously evaluated the location and limits of the 25 year nobuild lines and the 100year floodplain lines  e for those sinkholes that have not been previously evaluated calculations supporting the establishment of 25year nobuild lines and 100year floodplain elevations  f for those sinkholes that have been previously evaluated and reevaluation is desired hydrologic and hydraulic calculations to support the alteration of the established flood elevation lines  g evidence

permits permit issuance by the city may be made contingent on prior approval by the state  and j any additional supporting information deemed necessary by the chief building official to ensure the protection of the site surrounding properties or the sinkhole system 2 construction stage a all disturbed areas covered by this policy shall provide adequate structural and non structural erosion and sedimentation controls both onsite and around the perimeter of any sinkhole inlet receiving drainage to reduce the potential for sediment entering and clogging the sinkhole onsite controls shall be initiated prior to commencement of clearing operations sinkhole perimeter controls shall be established prior to the initiation of any clearing and grubbing operations all controls shall be inspected by a qualified and responsible party periodically and within 48 hours after heavy precipitation events adequate structural controls include but are not limited to entrenched and staked straw bale

of the elevation of the lowest floor asbuilt in relation to mean sea level said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor professional engineer or architect and certified by same the chief building official shall review the floor elevation survey data submitted deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stopwork order for the project andor deny issuance of a certificate of occupancy  general standards 1 no person shall place or cause to be placed any substances or objects other than stormwater runoff in any sinkhole or in the depression of any sinkhole relied on for stormwater drainage or place or cause to be placed any substances or objects in such a way so as to allow such substances or objects to be washed into a sinkhole inlet during storm events 2 no person shall fill or obstruct the outlet to a sinkhole or system of sinkholes or fill over a spring or sink outlet without first defining the flow area to that outlet or spring and ascertaining tracing or other means the areas that rely on the outlet for drainage and that filling of such outlet or spring will not increase flooding in the sink system of use of the system or sink outlet 3 extreme care should be taken in planning constructing and operating such land uses as may store and handle potential groundwater pollutants such as gas stations or in design and construction of septic systems 4 the immediate area around a sink must be disturbed as little as possible the use of mechanized equipment near the subterranean drain shall be done with caution 5 flow exiting from culverts or other concentrated drainage should be carried by riprap or concrete drain to the drain inlet with the inclusion of energy dissipators as appropriate where an identified throat exists which is to be improved a steel grate of adequate proportions should encase the inlet to prevent debris stoppage the city must approve throat improvement methods and designs prior to construction 6 the city strongly recommends that appropriate geotechnical studies be done and measures taken to insure structure foundations are designed to take into account potential sinkhole locations and instability such studies should account for potential foundation problems for both undisturbed sink areas and those previously filled by others in addition the placement of fill material within sinkholes is generally undesirable because the placement of fill reduces the volume within the sink available for stormwater storage geotechnical studies for sites within karst terrain routinely include but are not limited to drilling to assess subsurface conditions recommendations for site preparation and a discussion of specific geologic hazards such as sinkhole collapse and subsidence the impact on foundation alternatives such as shallow or deep foundations may be presented as a cost versus risk decision to the property ownerdeveloper  estimated nobuild and floodplain line locations 1 an estimated nobuild line shall be established and indicated on all preliminary and final plans and drainage easements dedicated which indicates the level to which water would rise assuming no outflow for the four percent probability 25year return period sixhour storm this runoff volume is to be calculated by assuming that the four percent 25year sixhour storm depth of four inches over the whole drainage basin to the sink flows into the sink with no outflow the area encompassed by this line shall be defined as a nobuild zone for all structures no portion of any development can be located within this zone 2 an estimated sinkhole one percent storm 100year storm floodplain line shall be delineated on all preliminary and final plans which indicates the level to which water would rise assuming no outflow for the one percent 100year sixhour storm this runoff volume is to be calculated by assuming that the one percent 100year sixhour storm depth of five inches over the whole site flows into the sink with no outflow the lowest habitable floor elevation for any habitable structure shall be located a minimum of one foot above this floodplain elevation 3 electrical heating ventilation plumbing air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed andor located at least one foot above the one percent storm floodplain line or as specified by floodproofing requirements to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding 4 the estimated nobuild and floodplain line locations must be established after volume lost to anticipated fill or structure placement within the sink has been removed if the established lines overtop the sink and there is a surface outflow the line shall be approximately located one foot above the sink top 5 these estimated line locations shall remain intact unless adjusted and potentially lowered using the analysis procedure given in adjustments to nobuild and floodplain line locations 1 two basic methods to potentially lower the line elevations and reduce the building setback are discussed in the following paragraphs the methods require the routing of watershed runoff hydrographs sink areas in a manner similar to detention pond design the runoff hydrographs shall be developed using the scs 24hour storm and curve number methodology the city reserves the right to approve runoff flow and timing factors the methods can be used alone or in combination 2 any applicable software may be used however the use of software with which the city is familiar will expedite review in any case the designer must submit the following information rainfall amounts curve number and timeofconcentration tabulations inflow and outflow hydrograph in graphical and tabular form stagedischarge curves in tabular form based on site topographic survey with control mapping included site layout sketch plan showing the four percent 25year and one percent 100year setback lines and elevations the location and elevations ground and first habitable floor where applicable of all adjacent structures and sketch plan of the sinkhole system showing the outlet points and giving pertinent information on increased flow rates and downstream system capacity 3 the nobuild and floodplain limits can be reduced provision of a surface overflow to a suitable receiving point or points in such cases to establish the applicable delineated zones the runoff hydrograph from the four percent 25year 24hour and one percent 100year 24hour storms shall be routed sinkhole calculating the surface overflow in a manner similar to detention pond design routing other engineering means to lower the floodplain line can also be used such as upstream manmade holding ponds retention detention diversions storm drain piping and pump stations full buildout conditions in the entire watershed draining to the sink shall be used for all routing analyses 4 the establishment of the no build and floodplain line limits may also rely on outflow from the sink and routing of the runoff hydrographs from the four percent 25year 24hour and one percent 100year 24hour storms this can be done only if no flooding would occur with total sink blockage for the four percent 25year sixhour storm  the developer submits a hydrogeologic study which indicates using appropriate methods the calculated flow rates stagedischarge curve sinkhole considering the possibility of high groundwater table or downstream flow backing into the sink to reduce or stop outflow during wet or flood conditions  the outlet points from the sink is are established tracing  full buildout conditions for the entire watershed draining to the sink are used for all routing analyses  the throat of the sink has been permanently improved in a manner approved by the city  state approvals if necessary are obtained  and the city grants permission to use the sink outflow  offsite sinkholes 1 for flow into an offsite sinkhole the developer must perform the routing analysis contained in either existing or improved sink conditions if permission for sink improvement or modification is granted by the property owner there are two cases which may occur either existing qualified structures are located within the four percent chance 25year storm nobuild line or below the one percent chance 100year elevation or no existing qualified structure is so located 2 in the case where existing structures are located within the limits of the nobuild or floodplain lines a development may not increase flow elevations to sinks which are located on anothers property without obtaining the written permission of the sink owner all other requirements shall apply for use of such offsite sink full buildout conditions shall be used for all routing analysis if such permission cannot be obtained the upstream property owner must design his site such that the peak flow elevations within the sink are no greater than at predevelopment conditions this can normally be accomplished using onsite detention or retention or finding another suitable outlet site 3 in the case where no structures are located within the calculated lines no controls are required as long as the proposed development would not expand the nobuild and floodplain lines established by routing
