the sewer user volume charge or b the median sewer user volume charge experienced for all other users of the same category may be used and the resultant charge known as the median usage method rate  2

system user has a consumptive use of water or in some other manner uses water which does not enter the wastewater collection system during the winter average water usage period the sewer user charge for that contributor may be adjusted according to a method acceptable to the city manager the city manager in making his determination of an acceptable adjustment method shall rely upon a quantitative method of determining the amount of water which did not enter into the wastewater collection system and in the event the user disputes either the method or the resultant calculation the user shall have the burden of proving a different method or calculation to be more appropriate as an alternative to the foregoing adjustment method any nonresidential public sewage system user may select any three consecutive months as an alternative to the months of december january and february as is provided in subsection b of this section and the period so selected shall become the basis for
