feet of floor area will adequately hold a weeks accumulation of recyclables municipalities with biweekly or monthly collection may need to allow extra space for material storage this is enough space to hold either a threetier unit of three or four fivegallon buckets 2 condominiumstownhousesapartment buildings each individual unit should be designed to accommodate a weeks accumulation of paper glass and metals this can be accomplished by allowing space under the sink area or in a closet for a threetier stacking unit or for fivegallon buckets this would occupy only three square feet of floor area and would give residents a convenient area for storing their recyclables a central location should be provided so that residents can drop off their sourceseparated recyclables for storage until collection occurs a suggested location for these sites  22530 general provisions  22531  would be near the refuse receptacle units these could be outdoor recycling bins located near the refuse units

designed for interim storage of gaylord containers or hampers these containers are approximately four feet by four feet by four feet and hold approximately 500 pounds of paper the size of the storage area required will be dependent on the number of workers in the buildings and the frequency with which the vendor picks up the materials 5 corrugated containers because corrugated is a particularly bulky item for disposal it needs to be flattened and baled compacted or tied in bundles space will be required for storage of materials prior to pickup by either a paper vendor or a recycling contractor the amount of space required for storage will depend on the amount of material generated by the establishment and whether the material is baled tied in bundles or stored in a compactor 6 glass the simplest method for storing glass after it has been separated by color is by purchasing or leasing a glass crusher this will obviously allow more glass to be stored in a smaller space if this is not available glass will need to be rinsed color separated and stored in fiftyfivegallon drums in small dumpsters or in fourby fourbyfour pallet boxes which can be loaded by a fork lift there are approximately three twelveounce bottles in a pound and one cubic yard of whole bottles weighs 600 pounds or approximately 900 twelveounce bottles 7 tin cans a commercial establishment generating

1 whereas the municipal land use law requires that every municipality prepare a master plan which is to lay out the longterm development goals for a municipality which are to be carried out though the enactment of local land use ordinances  and 2 whereas deviations from these local ordinances by way of variances pursuant to njsa d70c and njsa d70d as well as exceptions and waivers pursuant to njsa d51 provide opportunities for significant private gain  and 3 whereas openness in government and a fair and impartial variance waiver and exception application process is crucial to assuring the continuing integrity of the municipal master plan its implementing ordinances and the integrity of the variance application process  and 4 whereas disclosure of political contributions by property owners developers and professionals will enhance the boroughs existing commitment to openness in government and provide further guaranties for a fair and impartial variance waiver and exception application process  and 5 whereas disclosure of political contributions by property owners developers and professionals will advance the purposes of the municipal land use law to promote morals and the general welfare  6 now therefore be it ordained that the policy of the borough of spring lake will be to enhance the boroughs commitment to openness in government by providing further guaranties for a fair and impartial variance waiver and exception application process and in promoting morals and the general welfare  spring lake code  22542  integrity of the municipal planning process by

mitigation shall incorporate the definition set forth in  3214 of this chapter and shall include situations where the applicant has demonstrated the inability or impracticality of strict compliance with the stormwater management requirements set forth in njac  in addition to the requirements set forth in this chapter 2 the board having jurisdiction over an application requiring a stormwater management plan shall have the jurisdiction to grant a waiver from strict compliance with the performance requirements of this chapter or the stormwater management plan the waiver may be granted where an applicant has demonstrated the inability or impracticality of strict compliance with this chapter andor the stormwater management plan upon the following conditions the applicant must demonstrate one of the following a an inability to apply any of the best management practices and methodologies as defined and approved herein and in the stormwater management plan due to an extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely affecting the subject property or structures thereon resulting in a peculiar and exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship  or b that the purposes of this chapter and stormwater management plan can be advanced by a deviation from the best management practices and methodologies as defined and approved herein and in the stormwater management plan where the benefits of such deviation substantially outweigh any detriment c in requesting a waiver as to any application the applicant may submit as reasons for the waiver the site conditions of the proposed project including soils types  thin soil cover  low permeability soils andor shallow depths to groundwater high groundwater levels  unique conditions which would create an unsafe design  or conditions which would provide a detrimental impact to public health welfare or safety d the waiver cannot be granted due to conditions created by the applicant if the applicant can comply with the requirements of this chapter and the stormwater management plan general provisions  32114  reducing the size of a project the hardship is selfimposed and therefore the board lacks jurisdiction to grant any waiver under this section e the applicant must propose a suitable mitigation method submission of a mitigation plan which will conform as closely as possible to the design and performance standards of this chapter or nonstructural stormwater management measures governing stormwater quality quantity and groundwater recharge approval of a waiver or exemption from any one of the three stormwater design standard criteria which include groundwater recharge water quality and water quantity provides no guarantee that if requested an exemption or waiver will be granted for either or both of the remaining criteria f supporting evidence for an exemption or waiver shall be prepared in the form of a stormwater management report which will be signed and sealed by a new jersey licensed professional engineer the report shall include at a minimum  detailed hydrologic and hydraulic calculations identifying the sizing criteria for each bmp and the stormwater collection system based upon the anticipated peak flow andor volume  a map of the planned project showing existing conditions with drainage boundaries and land features including delineated wetlands proposed improvements including all bmps grading utilities impervious features and landscaping  construction details for each bmp with appropriate contact information b mitigation criteria the mitigation requirements listed below offer a hierarchy of options that are intended to offset the effect on groundwater recharge stormwater quantity control andor stormwater quality control to an equal or greater extent than was created by the granting of a waiver or exemption from the stormwater management requirements the mitigation criteria are listed below in order of preference 1 identify design and implement a compensating measure to mitigate impacts the preferred option is to identify and develop a compensating mitigation project in the same drainage area as the proposed development in these cases the applicant will address the same issue within the design and performance standards for which the variance or exemption is being sought and demonstrate that the proposed mitigating measures provide equal or greater compensation to offset the noncomplying aspect of the stormwater management system on site the developer must also ensure the  32114 spring lake code  32114  longterm maintenance of the project as outlined in chapters 8 and 9 of the njdep stormwater bmp manual if the borough agrees to control a new stormwater management facility arrangement in the form of an escrow account will be made to stipulate the payment amount schedule and longterm responsibilities of the facility to ensure that it functions to capacity 2 complete a project identified by the municipality as equivalent to the environmental impact created by the exemption or variance a if a suitable site cannot be located in the same drainage area as the proposed development as discussed in option 1 the mitigation project may provide measures that are not directly equivalent to the impacts for which the variance or exemption is being sought but that address the same issue to an equal or greater extent for example if a variance is given because the eightypercent tss requirement has not been met the selected project may address water quality impacts that increase the siltation of a water body within the applicable huc 14 subwatershed b if these criteria cannot be met onsite spring lake may consider granting a waiver from its adopted stormwater management design and performance if an applicant is able to identify and propose to complete a mitigation project that will improve water quality water quantity or groundwater recharge to an equal or greater extent than that for which the applicant is seeking a waiver as such an appropriate mitigation measure may take place within the larger confines of the huc14 subwatershed area or another portion of the borough rather than the contributing area within which the proposed project is located if the spring lake borough planning board finds that the mitigation will equally protect public health safety and welfare the environment and public and private property 3 provide funding for municipal projects that would address existing stormwater impacts the third and least preferable stormwater mitigation option is for the applicant to provide funding or partial funding for an environmental enhancement project that has been identified in this municipal stormwater management plan or towards the development of a regional stormwater management plan the contributed funds must be equal or greater than the cost to implement the required onsite stormwater measure for which relief is requested including the cost of land easements engineering design and longterm maintenance however with this option spring lake borough not the applicant is ultimately responsible for the design property acquisition construction construction management maintenance shortterm and longterm and followup study unless that project and its prospective costs have been outlined within this mitigation plan  32114 general provisions  32114  4 an applicant may also propose a mitigation project on a site that has not been identified in this mitigation plan however in each circumstance the selection of a mitigation project must incorporate the following requirements a the project must be within the same area that would contribute to the receptor impacted by that project if there is no specific sensitive receptor impacted then the location of the mitigation project may be located anywhere within the municipality preferably at a location that would provide the greatest benefit b legal authorization must be obtained to construct the project at the location selected this includes the maintenance and any access needs for the project throughout its operation c the mitigation project should be located close to the original development project if possible the mitigation project should be located at a similar distance from the identified sensitive receptor this distance should not be based on actual location but on a similar hydraulic distance to the sensitive receptor for example if a project for which a waiver is obtained discharges to a tributary but the closest location discharges to the main branch of a waterway it may be more beneficial to identify a location discharging to the same tributary d it is preferable to have one location that addresses any and all of the performance standards waived rather than one location for each performance standard e the project location must demonstrate no adverse impacts to other properties f for projects addressing the groundwater recharge performance standard a mitigation project site upstream of the location of the actual project site is preferable to a downstream location g mitigation projects that address stormwater runoff quantity can choose to provide storage for proposed increases in runoff volume as opposed to a direct peak flow reduction h mitigation projects that address stormwater runoff quality can choose to address another pollutant other than tss which has been demonstrated to be of particular concern such as streams that have been listed as an impaired water body for other pollutants however care must be taken to ensure that waivers that are granted for the tss requirements do not result in the impairment of an existing unimpaired area c requirements for mitigation projects  32114 spring lake code  32114  1 whether the applicant is proposing the mitigation project or spring lake has identified the project within this mitigation plan the following requirements for mitigation must be included in the project submission a impact from noncompliance the applicant must provide a table to show the required values and the values provided in the project and include an alternatives analysis that demonstrates that onsite compliance was maximized to the greatest extent practicable b narrative and supporting information regarding the need for the waiver the waiver cannot be granted for a condition that was created by the applicant if the applicant can provide compliance with the stormwater rules reduction in the scope of the project the applicant has created the condition and a waiver cannot be issued the applicant must provide a discussion and supporting information of the site conditions that would not allow the construction of a stormwater management facility to provide compliance with these requirements andor if the denial of the application would impose an extraordinary hardship on the applicant brought about by circumstances peculiar to the subject property the site conditions to be considered are soil type the presence of karst geology acid soils a high groundwater table unique conditions that would create an unsafe design as well as conditions that may provide a detrimental impact to public health welfare and safety c sensitive receptor identify the sensitive receptor related to the performance standard for which a waiver is sought  demonstrate that the mitigation site contributes to the same sensitive receptor d design of the mitigation project provide the design details of the mitigation project this includes but is not limited to drawings calculations and other information needed to evaluate the mitigation project e responsible party the mitigation project submission must list the party or parties responsible for the construction or maintenance of the mitigation project documentation must be provided to demonstrate that the responsible party is aware of has authority to perform and accepts the responsibility for the construction and the maintenance of the mitigation project under no circumstances shall the responsible party be an individual singlefamily homeowner f maintenance the applicant must include a maintenance plan that addresses the maintenance criteria at njac 5 as part of a mitigation plan in addition if the maintenance  32114 general provisions  32114  responsibility is being transferred to spring lake borough or another entity the entity responsible for the cost of the maintenance must be identified spring lake provides applicants with the option of conveying the mitigation project to the borough provided that the applicant funds the cost of maintenance of the facility in perpetuity g permits the applicant is solely responsible to obtain any and all necessary local state or other applicable permits for the identified mitigation project or measure the applicable permits must be obtained prior to the municipal approval of the project for which the mitigation is being sought h construction the applicant must demonstrate that the construction of the mitigation project coincides with the construction of the proposed project a certificate of occupancy or final approval by the municipality for the application permit cannot be issued until the mitigation project or measure receives final approval any mitigation projects proposed by the municipality to offset the stormwater impacts of the boroughs own projects must be completed within six months of the completion of the municipal project in order to remain in compliance with spring lakes njpdes general permit 2 in all instances the board having jurisdiction over the application shall have the power to impose additional conditions as may be appropriate under the circumstances of the application the board shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions consistent with showing the inability or impracticality of strict compliance with this chapter and the stormwater management plan and justifying the approval of the applicants mitigation plan in order to satisfy the reporting requirements of the municipalitys njpdes permit and other applicable state law requiring the submission of reports to any state or county review agency the board shall also have the power to require mitigation as to applications which have received waivers from the new jersey department of environmental protection 3 the board having jurisdiction over an individual application may determine that due to the size of the project necessary to mitigate for the waiver it is not practical to require a mitigation project  32114 spring lake code  32114  streets and sidewalks  32114
