applicant would apply for subdivision approval a subdivision is further classified as either major or minor a major subdivision will in general involve the dividing of a lot into 1 more than three lots or 2 two or more lots that will require road construction to provide frontage for all lots a minor subdivision would typically involve the division of land into three or fewer lots that do not require new roads utilities or other municipal improvements the process 31 overview the process for obtaining subdivision approval from the haverhill planning board involves a series of steps discussed below voluntary lot mergers and lot line adjustments although not subdivisions are covered in these regulations and are also discussed  major or minor subdivision a recommended but not

is removed so slowly that the soil is saturated periodically during the growing season or remains wet for long periods free water is commonly at or near the surface for long enough during the growing season that most mesophytic crops cannot be grown unless the soil is artificially drained the soil is  not continuously saturated in layers directly below plow depth poor drainage results from a high water table a slowly pervious layer within the profile seepage nearly continuous rainfall or a combination of these b very poorly drained soils water is removed from the soil so slowly that free water remains at or on the surface during most of the growing season unless the soil is artificially drained most mesophytic crops cannot be grown very poorly drained soils are commonly level or depressed
