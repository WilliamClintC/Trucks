of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the town and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the town the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent or the effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor the effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material b based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the mayor and council and on studies in other communities including but not limited to the experience of the cities of college park forest park marietta and smyrna the mayor and council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises the commercial exploitation of human sexuality in all forms in which such exploitation may be manifested has a deleterious effect on the community where it takes place as heretofore mentioned and that such effects are intensified and exacerbated when such is provided in conjunction with the service or consumption of alcohol there is a correlation between sexually oriented businesses and an increase in criminal behavior in nearby areas including but not limited to disorderly conduct prostitution solicitation drug trafficking drug use and corruption of public officials 2 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 3 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which create unhealthy conditions further such establishments escalate undesirable community conditions including blight diminished property values and cause increases in the need for law enforcement and emergency medical response resources increases in the burden on the judicial system as a result of the criminal behavior which the mayor and council finds such business establishments bring to a community the negative effects such businesses cause are not limited to such facilities that offer live or recorded performances with human nudity or the depiction of sexual acts but that other forms of sexually oriented businesses also have deleterious effect on nearby neighborhoods commercial districts and on urban life in general these other types of such businesses include but are not limited to adult bookstores peep shows massage parlors bathhouses adult gift and novelty shops and lingerie or nude modeling studios 4 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug use exposure to infected blood and blood components 5 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 6 the findings noted in subsections b1 5 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 7 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 8 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult entertainment establishments 9 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 10 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 11 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this article  2172011 punishment for violation  abatement of nuisance  jurisdiction  injunction a the violation of any of the provisions of this article

herein as applicable to this article emergency means a sudden or unforeseen occurrence involving a clear and imminent danger to life health or property  the interruption of utility services  or repairs to transportation facilities that require immediate action extraordinary circumstances means circumstances other than normal operating conditions which exist and make it impractical or

snow and acts of god  262014 white lining a background white lining is a practice that has been widely used in the united states where the national transportation board concluded that premarking is a practice that helps prevent excavation damage the procedure simply involves an excavator using white paint to indicate the route or area that is going to be excavated such that the locator then knows exactly how much marking is required and where white lining reduces confusion about what utilities need to be marked or not marked b purpose the purpose of white lining is to allow everyone involved with the dig site to know the exact location of the proposed excavation white lining the excavation site is an excellent way to assist the utilities or utility locators in marking lines in the work area right the first time and in less time this technique eliminates speculation by the locator about where the excavation will take place and will often enable the utility or its agent to locate faster and more accurately in short premarking the area and the extent of the intended excavation can reduce delays and the time it takes to perform the locate c examples  timing examples of areas to be white lined are smaller involving only a portion of a particular address or linear excavations such as telecommunication drops and lines service lines such as for water gas electricity and sewer utility pits cuts and repairs curb repairs bore holes directional boring pathways pole and signage placements etc such examples are merely explanatory of the type of excavation where white lining is appropriate and are not meant to be exclusive white lining shall be completed prior to contacting ga811 to obtain a locate request ticket number electronicvirtual white lining shall be clearly marked on submitted documentation within a 20foot tolerance zone of the proposed excavation site d exceptions to white lining exceptions are allowed as follows 1 for large projects as defined in ocga  259318 unless one or more utility facilities are damaged three times or more collectively by a contractor making the locate request within a 90day contract period white lining will not be required for any large project so designated in accordance with gspc rule 5159413 a copy of gspc rule 5159413 currently in effect is attached to as exhibit a and by this reference is incorporated herein  said exhibit is on file in the town offices every contractor begins each large project with zero damages it is only when three damages atfault damages occur during the 90day period of the specific large project that the white lining requirement will be triggered a large project ticket holder whose past prohibits it from being exempt as stated above will be subject to no more than a twoday shutdown period and shall be required to white line the remainder of the project to meet the large project marking facility locating agreement schedule that the ticket holder and utility originally agreed upon  2 homeownersoccupants involved in excavation or land disturbance that is confined to a single address or parcel homeownersoccupants shall not submit locate requests for excavation or land disturbance that will be performed by a business a contractor or a utility businesses contractors and utilities are not exempt from white lining  3 emergencies and extraordinary circumstances as such terms are defined herein are statutory exceptions to the requirement for obtaining a locate ticket prior to commencing mechanized excavation and hence also exceptions to the requirement for white lining under this section however if a particular emergency notification is later determined not to have been an emergency or an extraordinary circumstance then the excavators failure to procure a locate ticket before excavating will be treated as a violation of this section also preexcavation emergency locate ticket requests that is a request for a locate ticket on an expedited basis sooner than the prescribed time limit will not be an exception to white lining as required in this section  4 residential telecommunication service drop lines that can be delineated by the route of the existing line on the ground for single residential addressparcel requests only  and 5 termite baiting systems e white lining symbols as directions to locator white lining proposed dig sites that will follow a single path or trench shall be marked using white lines andor arrows and shall be located for 20 feet on either side of the white line and for 20 feet outward beyond the designated start and end of such linear white line therefore it is important to identify the starting and ending points f identification of white lining excavator in order to enable the locating utility or its locators to quickly identify the requested locate at the job site and expedite the locating process such excavator when white lining shall identify himself or itself by labeling the white line area with the excavators name or the applicable locate ticket number or both  262014   2 862015 facility marking by or for utilities a utility markings facility owners or their locate contractors shall indicate utility facilities by placing their upc alpha code along with the type material if known that the facility consists of at the beginning and end of locates also arrows should be placed at the ends of markings to indicate that the underground facility continues in accomplishing the locate task the line locator shall use industryapproved and generally accepted methods of locating the tolerance zone shall be 18 inches measured horizontally from the outer edge of either side of such marked utility facilities 1 to avoid confusion on long runs the marks shall be frequent enough to identify the owner 2 the marks shall indicate the approximate centerline of the underground lines for example the middle of the cable line or pipe shall be at the center of the dashed marks 3 location marks shall be four to 12 inches in length and at intervals of five to ten feet if the facility to be marked has a greater diameter than 12 inches the size of the facility shall be indicated if known if size is not known then the mark shall be greater than 12 inches 4 the line locator person marking the lines shall extend marks outside the proposed work area by 20 to 30 feet if those facilities extend outside the proposed excavation area 5 in areas such as flower beds rock gardens etc flags or stakes may be an alternative to paint the decision to use flags paint or stakes shall be based on the terrain and job conditions for instance flags or stakes in wet areas offsets in dirt construction zones that have a high volume of traffic crossing their line location marks 6 dead ends stubouts termination points etc shall be marked as follows 7 lines that have connections eg ts or ys or changes in directions shall be clearly indicated marks indicating lines or connections shall clearly show the intersection and path of the line or connection marks that show changes in direction shall be placed closer together for more clarity and accuracy 8 manholes and valves shall be identified by using a circle and letters if they are not visible dirt covering valve boxes or pavement covering manhole cover 9 facilities that cross but do not intersect shall be marked as described to indicate such installation manner 10 unlocateable sewer laterals shall be marked by placing a green triangle on the sewer main and if the location of the tap for such unlocateable sewer lateral is known by placing a green t or y or other appropriate symbol at the tap pointing generally toward the address served by such unlocateable sewer lateral 11 when facilities share the same trench they shall be heavily identified and separated enough so that they can be readily identified this would apply to lines that share the same color code for example cable television and telephone lines 12 if the facility to be marked has a diameter greater than 12 inches the size of the facility shall be indicated if known if the size is not known then the mark shall indicate greater than 12 inches 13 duct structures shall be marked by using a dot with parallel boundary on each side of the dot 14 in areas where there is a strong likelihood that any or all marker types showing line location would be destroyed offsets shall be placed on a permanent surface however offsets should be used only in conjunction with marks placed above a facility offset spacing should be every third or fourth mark for example the following mark would indicate the line is 16 feet from the end of the arrow 15 in areas where cables are spliced the facilities should be located individually as far as possible on both sides of the splice when the signal is distorted due to the near proximity to the splice a circle with sp should indicate the area of distortion or splice pit  262014   4 862015 facility protectiondamage

the root system within the drip line is generally considered to be the critical root zone to protect these critical root zones a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained b the tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the drip line of the tree or group of trees collectively in some instances an area greater than the drip line area may be required to be designated as a tree protection area as determined by the town manager c layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of tree protection areas whenever utilities must be installed within a tree protection area and such installation will encroach into the drip line of any tree to be saved the utility shall be installed by tunneling at a minimum depth of 36 inches reasonable efforts shall be made to save as many trees as possible including avoiding utility routing which would endanger the

within the critical root zones of exceptional trees stands of trees or otherwise designated tree protective zones the following preventive measures shall be employed a clearing activities roots often fuse and tangle among trees tree removal adjacent to tree save areas can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees where possible it is advisable to cut minimum twofoot trenches eg using a ditch witch along the limits of land disturbance so as to cut rather than tear roots trenching may be required for the protection of exceptional specimen trees b soil compacting no parking material storage or traffic shall be permitted within designated tree protective zones c utility installation the installation of utilities protective zone should occur by way of tunneling rather than trenching

trees within tree protective zones the trees shall be removed and replaced in a manner consistent with this article 4 trees to be retained a canopy trees with a drip line area within 20 feet of a proposed structure should be removed and replaced with an appropriate tree species when such canopy trees are to be saved special attention shall be given to protection of the drip line area the state forestry commission should be contacted for technical assistance b where design constraints require placement of paved surfaces within ten feet of the drip line area of a canopy tree such trees should be removed and replaced with an appropriate tree species alternately the state forestry commission may be contacted to provide technical assistance concerning appropriate precautions that may be used to protect the tree and pavements figure 6 c all reasonable efforts shall be made to save specimen trees reasonable effort shall include but not be limited to alteration of building design  alternate location of buildings parking areas and stormwater detention facilities  or relocation of utilities d when a choice is available as to which existing trees to save emphasis shall be given to the preservation of specimen trees even isolated individual trees over the retention of other trees nonspecimen trees however should be saved in stands rather than as individual trees scattered over a

must maintain a minimum site density of 100 units per acre the term unit is an expression of basal area and is not synonymous with tree the density requirement must be met as a condition of development permit issuance whether or not a property contained trees prior to development this density may be achieved for preserving existing trees by planting new trees according to the minimum standards of this article or combination of both b the following formula shall apply to site density standard sds analysis sds edf+rdf sds is the minimum site density to be achieved and maintained on all developed sites 100 units per acre existing density factor edf is the density value or credit of existing trees to be preserved on a site replacement density factor rdf is the density value of new trees to be planted on site c the following steps are used to calculate the required tree preservation or replacement density step 1 calculate the site density standard sds sds is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 100 example a 25acre site has a sds of 25  100   250 step 2 calculate the existing density factor edf edf is determined by converting the diameter of individual existing trees to site density units as indicated in table 1 in subsection d of this section these units are then totaled to determine the site edf example seven trees will remain on the 25acre site this includes four sixinch trees and one eightinch tree the following site density units are associated with the trees to be preserved number of trees size class density units site density 4 6inch 12 48 2 7inch 15 30 1 8inch 20 20 7 total 98 total the total site density units 98 is the existing density factor edf step 3 calculate the replacement density factor rdf rdf is determined by subtracting

percent of the total area of each development site as open space this is the atlanta regional commission minimum standard for impervious ratios in groundwater recharge areas it is accepted here as a reasonable standard for minimizing flooding potential and preserving the towns tree canopy for a twoacre lot this represents an area of 21780 square feet the town zoning ordinance requirement for landscaping is two trees for each 1000 square feet of permanently disturbed area the minimum planting size for canopy trees is 212inch caliper this results in 4356 trees for the 21780 square foot area accordingly a total of 40 trees in the 212inch size class 100 density units is the basis of the tree diameter conversion for replacement trees as this article favors preservation of existing trees the

alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  2 land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters  3 the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety public and private property drinking water supplies recreation fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters  4 these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas the preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged use of incentives or credits the georgia greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits  5 localities in the state are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution b therefore the town has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff
