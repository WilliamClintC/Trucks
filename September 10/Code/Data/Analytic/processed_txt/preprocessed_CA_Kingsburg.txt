current by regular supplementation by matthew bender & company inc its successor in interest beginning with supplement 4 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of matthew bender & company inc the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 4 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions

city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 beginning with

which lay within the boundaries of the citys redevelopment project areas and which are designated as areas characterized by a mixture of uses blighted structures and sites andor inadequate street and alley improvements the mxu combining district is to be applied to those redevelopment project areas selected by the city council as meeting the purposes of this section use arrangements within the areas designated mxu are to be made physically functionally and aesthetically compatible plan review architectural design review pud planned unit development procedures or a combination thereof as determined by the city council b applicable regulations and procedures the mxu combining district provides the flexibility needed to achieve the following goals 1 to facilitate full development of large pieces of commercial property different portions of which may have varying degrees of suitability and desirability for development for particular types of businesses 2 to improve land use conditions within redevelopment project areas under conditions of uncertainty as to the types of uses that may be proposed or that may be economically feasible for specific properties over time under mixed use all categories of land use shown on the general plan diagram are eligible for consideration because the best potential use for some properties may be more clearcut than for others the base land use designations of the general plan provide guidance for the selection of those base zoning districts to be applied however such guidance does not abrogate the potential and flexibility offered for mixed use an application for a building permit site plan review or pud will initiate the process for determining an appropriate development proposal under mixed use regulations the planning commission shall make a determination as to which procedures shall be followed under the provisions of chapters 1768 1772 and 1776 of this title  2005  part 1992 part 1982   pfpublic facilities
