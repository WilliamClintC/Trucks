findings and purpose  findings of fact the city council of the city of forks hereby finds that 1wetlands and their buffer areas are valuable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding erosion soil liquefaction potential and septic disposal limitations 2in their natural state wetlands provide many valuable social and ecological services including acontrolling flooding and stormwater runoff by storing or regulating natural flows  bprotecting water resources by filtering out water pollutants processing biological and chemical oxygen demand recycling and storing nutrients and serving as settling basins for naturally occurring sedimentation  cproviding areas for ground water recharge  dpreventing shoreline erosion by stabilizing the substrate  eproviding habitat areas for many species of fish wildlife and vegetation many of which are dependent on wetlands for their survival and many of which are on washington state and federal endangered species lists  fproviding open space and visual relief from intense development in urbanized areas  gproviding recreation opportunities  and hserving as areas for scientific study and natural resource education 3development in wetlands often results in the reduction of services provided by wetlands 4buffer areas surrounding wetlands assist in the maintenance and protection of wetland functions and values 5the loss of the social and ecological services provided by wetlands results in a detriment to public safety and welfare  replacement of such services if possible at all can require considerable public expenditure 6a considerable acreage of these important natural resources has been lost or degraded by draining dredging filling excavating building polluting and other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such areas remaining wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost despoiled or impaired by such acts it is therefore necessary for the city of forks to protect for wetland areas by discouraging development activities in wetlands and those activities at adjacent sites that may adversely affect wetland functions and values 7economic factors should be considered in the application and interpretation of wetland ordinances due to the limited number of wetlands in the city of forks and surrounding areas the limited resources available to the city of forks to administer wetlands ordinances and the priority of the city of forks to promote and foster economic development 1 1992  purpose 1the primary purpose of this chapter is to satisfy the requirements of

quality wetlands  iiiall bogs  ivmature and oldgrowth forested wetlands larger than one acre  vwetlands in coastal lagoons  or viwetlands that perform many functions well category i wetlands represent a unique or rare wetland type are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands are relatively undisturbed and contain some ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime or provide a very high level of functions bcategory ii category ii wetlands are iestuarine wetlands smaller than one acre or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre  iia wetland identified by the washington state department of natural resources as containing sensitive plant species  iiian interdunal wetland larger than one acre  or ivwetlands with a moderately high level of functions category ii wetlands are difficult though not impossible to replace and provide high levels of some functions these wetlands occur more commonly than category i wetlands but they still need a relatively high level of protection ccategory iii category iii wetlands are iwetlands with a moderate level of functions  or iiinterdunal wetlands between onetenth and one acre in size generally wetlands in this category may have been disturbed in some way and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than category ii wetlands dcategory iv category iv wetlands have the lowest levels of functions and are often heavily disturbed these are wetlands that should be replaceable and in some cases may be improved however experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case these wetlands may provide some important functions and should be protected to some degree 3the category designation of a wetland shall be

1992  regulatory procedures for small wetlands 1evaluate wetlands between 1000 and 4000 square feet using ecologys wetland rating system for western washington 2004 to establish category and evaluate functions use the following criteria and local knowledge of natural resources to make an informed decision about whether to exempt wetlands between 1000 and 4000 square feet from the requirement to avoid impacts athe requirement to avoid impacts may be dropped for category iii and iv wetlands between 1000 and 4000 square feet that meet all of the following criteria iwetland is not associated with a riparian corridor  and iiwetland is not part of a wetland mosaic  and iiiwetland does not score 20 points or more for habitat in the wetland rating system  and ivwetland does not contain habitat identified as essential for local populations of priority species identified by washington department of fish and wildlife where there is a desire to place high priority on water quality functions add a criterion that includes wetlands that score 24 points or more for water quality function in the rating system such wetlands receive surface water drainage from the surrounding landscape and improve water quality before discharging water to downstream water bodies this approach could include specific drainages where protection of water quality is given higher priority and there are significant wetland resources that provide high levels of this function bimpacts allowed under this provision to these wetlands will be fully mitigated as required in fmc  mitigation requirements the rationale for dropping the requirement to avoid impacts for certain wetlands is based on the premise that functions provided by these category iii and iv wetlands can be adequately replaced by mitigation this approach may benefit local wetland resources by providing part of the funding feeinlieu system for larger local restoration projects that could provide higher functioning wetlands in the long term call category i and ii wetlands between 1000 and 4000 square feet should be evaluated with full mitigation sequencing and buffer establishment any approved impacts should be

the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action bminimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts crectifying the impact by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the affected environment dreducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations ecompensating for the impact by replacing enhancing or providing substitute resources or environments fmonitoring the required compensation and taking remedial or corrective measures when necessary 3compensating for lost or affected functions compensatory mitigation shall address the functions affected by the proposed project with an intention to achieve functional equivalency or improvement of functions the goal shall be for the compensatory mitigation to provide similar wetland functions as those lost except when either athe lost wetland provides minimal functions as determined by a sitespecific function assessment and the proposed compensatory mitigation actions will provide equal or greater functions or will provide functions shown to be limiting within a watershed formal washington state watershed assessment plan or protocol  or boutofkind replacement of wetland type or functions will best meet watershed goals formally identified by the city such as replacement of historically diminished wetland types 4preference of mitigation actions methods to achieve compensation for wetland functions shall be approached in the following order of preference arestoration reestablishment and rehabilitation of wetlands bcreation establishment of wetlands on disturbed upland sites such as those with vegetative cover consisting primarily of nonnative introduced species this should only be attempted when there is an adequate source of water and it can be shown that the surface and subsurface hydrologic regime is conducive for the wetland community that is anticipated in the design cenhancement of significantly degraded wetlands in combination with restoration or creation such enhancement should be part of a mitigation package that includes replacing the impacted area and meeting appropriate ratio requirements 5type and location of compensatory mitigation unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of ecological functioning would result from an alternate approach compensatory mitigation for ecological functions shall be either inkind and onsite or inkind and within the same stream reach subbasin or drift cell if estuarine wetlands are impacted compensatory mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same subdrainage basin and on the site of the alteration except when all of the following apply athere are no reasonable onsite or in subdrainage basin opportunities eg onsite options would require elimination of highfunctioning upland habitat or onsite and in subdrainage basin opportunities do not have a high likelihood of success based on a determination of the capacity of the site to compensate for the impacts boffsite mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved wetland functions than the impacted wetland coffsite locations shall be in the same subdrainage basin unless iestablished watershed goals for water quality flood storage or conveyance habitat or other wetland functions have been established by the city and strongly justify location of mitigation at another site  or iicredits from a statecertified wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the banks certification dthe design for the compensatory mitigation project needs to be appropriate for its location ie position in the landscape 6timing of compensatory mitigation it is preferred that compensatory mitigation projects be completed prior to activities that will disturb the onsite wetlands at the least compensatory mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbance and prior to use or occupancy of the action or development construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries wildlife and flora the planning director may authorize a onetime temporary delay in completing construction or installation of the compensatory mitigation when the applicant provides a written explanation from a qualified wetland professional as to the rationale for the delay an appropriate rationale would include identification of the environmental conditions that could produce a high probability of failure or significant construction difficulties eg project delay lapses past a fisheries window  or installing plants should be delayed until the dormant season to ensure greater survival of installed materials the delay shall not create or perpetuate hazardous conditions or environmental damage or degradation and the delay shall not be injurious to the health safety and general welfare of the public the request for the temporary delay must include a written justification that documents the environmental constraints that preclude implementation of the compensatory mitigation plan the justification must be verified and approved by the city 7mitigation ratios awhen an applicant proposes to alter or eliminate a regulated wetland the functions and values of the

no infrastructure in place yet were placed into the agreed upon urban growth area in 1991 the r1 zones are likely areas where urban development andor infill development will occur in time however the density and lot size requirements take into account the undeveloped nature of the property within the zones when roadways electrical power water service and telephone services are expanded into these areas by developers or utilities then those areas would become candidates for rezoning into another zone while sewer is an urban service current state law permits the usage of septic systems therefore sewer expansion is not necessarily mandated of developers attempting to obtain a rezone the parcel size is such that upon the installation of the infrastructure noted above the minimum sized lots could be redivided via a subdivision application or short plat application depending upon how the parcel in question is rezoned examples of very low density residential however not limited to said examples would be the parcels of commercial forest that exist to the west of andersonville the area associated with the southwestern portions of the fuga and portions of property between merchant road

of these eight acres two acres are located within the firm 100year floodplain one acre is located in an area that is designated as being steep slopeserosion hazard area and one acre is designated as a recognized wetland consisting of the wetland and the appropriate setbacks the fuga zoning code map designates the entire parcel as low density residential which permits a maximum density of one single dwelling unit per onehalf acres under other portions of this zoning code if the developer does not employ this section the developer has only four acres upon which they can develop and from which a density calculation can be made thus allowing the developer to only build up to eight dwelling units on the entire parcel however by employing the above zoning option the developer would be allowed to build a total of 16 dwelling units if permitted by city andor county building and health codes on the four acres not affected by critical areas nonfloodplain nonsteep slope nonwetlands portion of the parcel the nondeveloped lands would be noted as lands utilized for the density transfer pursuant to this portion of the fuga zoning code upon the face of the final plat or development plan the four nondevelopmental acres could be incorporated into any of the lots created by the applicant so long as the plat notes the boundary of such on each affected lot or the lands could be jointly owned by a housing association or the lands could be retained by the developer or the lands could be dedicated to the city or county the choice would be left up to the developer and that choice would be
