population using the dwelling unit equivalent of  persons per dwelling unit equivalent the cost of $2762000 per acre and the cost for development is $60000 per acre then the citys cost per dwelling unit equivalent is calculated to be $139316 the fee charged to developerowner of the property will be 323 percent of $139316 which equals a $45000 per dwelling unit equivalent formula 5 acres x $27620

utility mpu provides the public with its water reclaimed water and sewer services within the city limits the water and wastewater system is owned and operated by the city of mcallen in hidalgo county texas and is governed by the mcallen public utility board of trustees the amount of water the city water system can store treat divert and distribute to customers is limited mpu wants to avoid waste or unreasonable use of water which could lead to possible drought and emergency conservation strategies with an expected population increase over the next 50 years that well exceeds the national average  it is imperative that we maximize efficient water use practices and minimize both direct and indirect water waste while shortterm water shortages and water supply emergencies are often unpreventable response measures can be determined and implemented in advance to avoid minimize or mitigate the risks and impacts of droughtrelated water shortages and other emergencies the purpose of this plan is to establish a water conservation and drought contingency plan for the city in accordance with texas administrative the basic goal of the water conservation and drought contingency plan is to ensure an uninterrupted supply of water in an amount sufficient to satisfy essential human needs the water conservation plan develops a conservation strategy for reducing the volume of water withdrawn from a water supply source for reducing the loss or waste of water for increasing the recycling and reclaimed of water and for preventing the pollution of water the drought contingency plan is a strategy for temporary supply management and demand management responses to temporary and potentially recurring water supply shortages and other water supply emergencies i 5817 utility profile a

improvements plan to serve growth the recommended improvements will serve as a basis for the design construction and financing of facilities required to meet mpus water service needs as a result of projected population growth c water use characteristics mpu supplies water for residential commercial industrial and public use the total per capita use for the city in 2011 is estimated at 172 gallons per capita per day gpcd 2 this is an average taken by dividing the total water treated by the population served the residential gallons per capita per day are estimated at 108 gpcd residential gpcd is made by dividing total singlefamily and multifamily residential water sales by the population served the citys industrial users accounted for 16 percent of total water use the largest volume industrial user for 2011 was magic valley fresh frozen which purchased approximately 844 mg of water or 111 percent of total water usage large sized meters or those 15 inches and larger in size make up only 48 percent of the meters used but use 333 percent of the water conversely small sized meters or those oneinch and below make up 951 percent of all meters but account for less than 667 percent of metered sales d unaccountedfor water the citys unaccountedfor water is due to breaks leaks meter under registration processing flushing mains system loss and unmetered fire hydrants the amount of unaccountedfor water is determined by the difference between production and sales of water the average amount of unaccountedfor water loss for the past three years was ten percent the unaccountedfor loss of water for 2011 was ten percent e mpu operates two wastewater treatment plants both treatment plants are based upon extended aeration activated sludge system with secondary effluent limitations treated effluent is discharged into floodways and eventually into the arroyo colorado and laguna madre estuary the average annual treated wastewater volume for 20092011 was 51008 million gallons the

5817 water conservation goals based on the data found in the utility profile and on careful evaluation of the citys water consumption and practices mpu has set the following goals to be achieved adoption of this water conservation plan 1 to reduce daily municipal per capita water use to 168 gpcd by the year 2015 and to maintain the unaccountedfor water loss at ten to 12 percent by 2017 also to reduce daily municipal per capita water use to 160 gpcd by the year 2020 and to maintain the unaccountedfor water loss at eight to ten percent by 2022 at present the gpcd tenyear average is 187 and the unaccountedfor water loss is at ten percent 2 to implement long term costeffective recovery measures for major causes of unaccountedfor water related to metering we have implemented a meter change out policy that requires all meters to be changed out after 12 years or 15 mg of total flow and an aggressive meter testing program to identify and deal with problem meters a 2011 audit reflected that our program is working 3 to increase both public and employee awareness regarding water conservation and water related issues this will especially be encouraged during summer months when water consumption increases significantly 4 to investigate the potential for wastewater effluent reclaimed and to use reclaimed water when practical 5 to promote xeriscape landscape use like lowwater using shrubs and plants patios rocks decks and walkways in order to reduce the amount of high water consuming landscape area businesses as well as residential users will be encouraged to participate 6 to promote more efficient irrigation techniques for agriculture industry and private use retrofit and education 7 a full time water education specialist is on staff this specialist will be developing conservation programs and educational offerings to both public and school children audiences to enhance understanding of water utility systems as well as promote water conservation and prevention of pollution of water resources 8 wholesale customers will be required to implement and adhere to a water conservation and drought contingency plan currently no wholesale contracts exist 9 mpu will strive to attain a two percent reduction goal during water conservation stages i 5817 water conservation strategies a public education water conservation is promoted in the city following 1 public service announcements have been and will continue to be made regarding water conservation inside and outside the home as well as in the workplace for example tips on efficient lawn watering repairing leaks in the home and installing lowflow showerheads and faucet aerators have been publicized on local radio stations in newspapers and on television stations educational videos and service announcements are and will continue to be shown periodically on the mcallen cable network 2 new customers are given information such as brochures about water conservation when they open a new account with the city informative brochures as well as flyers are also on display at city hall where many customers come in to pay their water bill or take care of business with the utility department and at other city offices 3 employee education will also be furthered in the utility by periodic presentations regarding water use and conservation posters and additional brochures will also be distributed in city hall for employee use city employees who do not work at city hall will also be sent materials such as pamphlets and brochures to be displayed and read at their facilities customer service week is celebrated within all city departments every october during this time the utility has a booth at city hall to inform citizens on water conservation efforts and to improve public perception and awareness of the utilitys conservation efforts mpus water education specialist will make every effort to work with other city departments mcallenarea schools the international museum of art and science imas and other community groups to promote water conservation education by participating in special public events educational offerings and other activities examples include cosponsoring a poster contest having a booth at festivals or fairs or hosting community groups for water plant tours b recycling and reclaimed mpu currently has a recycle or reclaimed program for water via irrigation of treated wastewater effluent on the citys golf course additionally mpu has contracts to sell calpine and duke energy 5 mgd and 48 mgd respectively of treated wastewater effluent for reclaimed mpu began constructing a reclaimed line in 2011 that will eventually supply the convention center district and the citys nearby westside park with treated wastewater effluent for irrigation and landscape feature use such as decorative water fountains and other water features after recent developments have requested to purchase reclaimed water from the city for irrigation the mpu has amended its ordinance to allow for reclaimed water to be used for residential and institutional irrigation purposes c metering devices and universal metering 1 metering devices new meters two inches and smaller in size are bought according to the latest revision of awwa new meter standard for coldwater meters in order to specify all materials design manufacture and testing of all meters the manufacturer will guarantee that all new meters will test at 981 to 101 percent accurate at the maximum rate and 95 to 101 percent at the low flow rate as designed by awwa standards manual m6 on a meter size for size basis this ensures accurate and precise measurement of water diverted older meters that may be registering too high or low will be replaced as time permits in order to accurately account for water and lower any unaccountedfor water loss 2 metering mpu currently meters all water usage except that of fire hydrants and water loss due to leaks breaks processing flushing of mains and system loss mpu however does keep track of water used by fire hydrants city fire department mpu uses computers to maintain billing to keep accurate records of water consumption and to identify high and low water users mpu will test all meters that appear to show unusually high or low water usage based on fluctuating meter data water distribution tests meters based on an as needed basis when customers complain or a problem arises the mpu water distribution department is responsible for maintaining all 53200 connections meter readers use a portable meter tester andor a readaflow recorder to test meters in the field when meters cannot be read in the field they are taken into a meter shop to be assessed priority is always given to water leaks with all other tasks including service calls maintenance calls and other water distribution projects meter management study in september 201 jbs associates inc prepared a report of meter management study for the utility the study included an analysis of production and metered sales from january 2009 to june 201 and of individually metered water consumption accounts from february 2008 to january 2011 the report made recommendations that are currently being utilized such as the recommendation to implement quarterly testing of meter accuracy in the case of zeroconsumption or lowuse accounts d water distribution audit and leak survey in november 199 jbs associates inc completed a water distribution audit and leak survey the audit was conducted to determine causes for unaccountedfor water and develop recommendations for unaccountedfor water recovery in a costeffective manner this audit and leak survey is conducted every five years at a minimum a continuous leak detection and repair program is carried out by mpu meter readers also check for leaks while reading meters and performing regular maintenance for the year 2006200 a fullscale leak detection project was implemented e plumbing codes and retrofit program the city does have plumbing codes pursuant to the 2006 standard plumbing code issued from the international additionally the 72 nd texas legislature passed legislation which requires plumbing fixtures sold in the state after  to meet strict standards that incorporate efficient water use and conservation in new structures this law subsequently effects plumbing fixtures sold in the city and will help to eliminate inefficient plumbing fixtures mpu does encourage businesses and homeowners to replace older water fixtures like lowflow showerheads faucet aerators and toilet dams purchased before  with the newer water efficient replacements mpu will also advocate the use of low demand water appliances instead of older high use ones in homes and businesses f water conservation landscaping when practical mpu will advocate the use of drip irrigation for the watering of landscapes for commercial establishments also the use of ornamental fountains will be discouraged except when they recycle and use minimal quantities of water mpu will continue to work with the city parks and recreation department in order to eliminate any wasteful water use the watering of parks for example will be evaluated and done according to efficient water conserving methods municipal pools will also be evaluated for efficient water use local landscape architects and local nurseries will be asked and encouraged to utilize efficient irrigation systems and native low water using plants and grasses xeriscape gardening and landscaping techniques will also be asked to be promoted licensed irrigation contractors will be asked to use drip irrigation systems where possible and to use water conserving irrigation systems like sprinklers which produce large drips instead of a fine mist and a sprinkler layout which accommodates prevailing wind patterns g conservation oriented water rate structure the city has established three schedules of rates to be charged for the consumption of water supplied city water system as follows 1 standard water rate schedule within the city for city customers under the citys certificate of convenience and necessity 2 standard water rate schedule for areas previously covered
