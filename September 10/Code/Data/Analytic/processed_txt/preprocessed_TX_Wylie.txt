and the pumps each connection and the supply piping between the connection and the pumps shall be sized to supply the flow and pressure required for the pumps to operate exception {no change to exception} reason the 2009 edition of the ifc added this requirement based on a need for redundancy of the water supply similar to the redundancy of the power supply to the fire pumps required for such tall buildings partially due to the fact that these buildings are rarely fully evacuated in a fire event more commonly the alarm activates on the floor of the event the floor above and the floor below backup power to the fire pump becomes critical for this reason certainly the power is pointless if the water supply is impaired for any reason so a similar requirement is provided here for redundant water supplies the 2015 edition changes the requirement to only apply to very tall buildings over 420 feet  this amendment modifieslowers the requirement to 120 feet  based on this same height requirement for fire service access elevators again the language from the 2009 and 2012 editions of the code applied to any highrise building this compromise at 120 feet is based on the above technical justification of defendinplace scenarios in fire incidents in such tall structures   delete exception reason consistent with amended atrium definition carport separation  add sentence to

traceinsulation heat traceinsulation shall only be allowed where approved by the fire code official for small sections of large diameter waterfilled pipe reason in the last few years severe winters brought to light several issues with current practices for sprinklering attics not the least of which was wetpipe sprinklers in ventilated attics provided with space heaters etc for freeze protection of such piping this practice is not acceptable for the protection of waterfilled piping in a ventilated attic space as it does not provide a reliable means of maintaining the minimum 40 degrees required by nfpa wastes energy and presents a potential ignition source to the attic space listed antifreeze is specifically included because nfpa currently allows such even though there is no currently listed antifreeze at the time of development of these amendments the intent of this amendment is to help reduce the large number of freeze breaks that have occurred in the past with waterfilled wetpipe sprinkler systems in the future most specifically in attic spaces   add a second paragraph to read as follows f water supply as required for such systems shall be provided in

component of the urban built environment providing important information and directions to community residents and visitors however 1 the uncontrolled proliferation of signs are hazardous to users of streets and highways within the city of wylie and will adversely affect the safety and efficiency of the citys transportation network  and 2 unless the location number setback lighting and size of signs are regulated the scattering of the signs throughout the city would be detrimental to the preservation of scenic resources and so to the economic base of the city  and 3 the proliferation of signs in the city has an adverse effect on adjacent property values  and 4 the orderly and uniform regulation of signs are a substantial factor in guiding the attractive and aesthetic development of properties in accordance with the comprehensive plan and thereby avoiding detrimental impacts of signs on the appearance of the city b therefore it is the intent of these regulations 1 to protect the safety and efficiency of the citys transportation network by reducing the confusion or distraction to motorists and enhancing the motorists ability to see pedestrians obstacles other vehicles and traffic signs  2 to preserve protect and enhance areas of historical architectural cultural aesthetic and economic value regardless of whether they are natural or manmade  3 to protect the value of adjacent and nearby properties in particular residentially zoned properties from the impact of lighting size height movement and location of signs  4 to enhance the image of the city which is conveyed to tourists and visitors by controlling the location number and size of signs  5 to integrate sign regulations more effectively with other regulations by establishing regulations for setbacks height and spacing to allow for lighting ventilation and preservation of views in a manner consistent with land uses in the various zoning districts  and 6 to preserve and enhance the appearance of the city and the public interest in aesthetics and to control and reduce visual clutter and blight  2 3exh a 1292014 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the

vents shall operate automatically by actuation of a heatresponsive device rated at between 100f 56c and 220f 122c above ambient exception listed gravityoperated drop out vents reason amendment continues to keep applicable wording from prior to the 2012 edition of the ifc specifically automatic activation criteria is no longer specifically required in the published code specifying a

area of makeup air inlets shall be 8 square feet per 1000 cubic feet per minute 074 m2 per  m3s of smoke exhaust reason makeup air has been required to be automatic for several years now in this region when mechanical smoke exhaust systems are proposed this allows such systems to be activated from the smoke control panel by first responders without having to physically go around the exterior of the building opening doors manually such requires a significant number of first responders on scene to conduct this operation and significantly delays activation andor capability of the smoke exhaust system   change to read as follows  activation the mechanical smoke removal system shall be activated automatically by the automatic sprinkler system or by an approved fire detection system individual manual controls shall also be provided exception manual only systems per reason the provision of a manual only mechanical smoke removal system does not provide equivalency with automatic

that required for the pump room or as approved by the fire code official access keys shall be provided in the key box as required by reason this requirement allows fire fighters safer access to the fire pump room the requirement allows access without being required to enter the building and locate the fire pump room interior access door during a fire event the exception recognizes that this will not always be a feasible design scenario for some buildings and as such provides an acceptable alternative to protect the pathway to the fire pump room   change to read as follows 2 water supply to

separate supply piping shall be provided between each connection to the water main and the pumps each connection and the supply piping between the connection and the pumps shall be sized to supply the flow and pressure required for the pumps to operate exception {no change to exception} reason the 2009 edition of the ifc added this requirement based on a need for redundancy of the water supply similar to the redundancy of the power supply to the fire pumps required for such tall buildings partially due to the fact that these buildings are rarely fully evacuated in a fire event more commonly the alarm activates on the floor of the event the floor above and the floor below backup power to the fire pump becomes critical for this reason certainly the power is pointless if the water supply is impaired for any reason so a similar requirement is provided here for redundant water supplies the 2015 edition changes the requirement to only apply to very tall buildings over 420 feet  this amendment modifieslowers the requirement to 120 feet  based on this same height requirement for fire service access elevators again the language from the 2009 and 2012 editions of the code applied to any highrise building this compromise at 120 feet is based on the above technical justification of defendinplace scenarios in fire incidents in such tall structures   add a new as follows 6 electrical

which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  3 6102014 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this division to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  3 6102014 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this division uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands secs 50355055

accordance with the home rule powers of the city granted under the state constitution and the statutes of the state including but not by way of limitation vtca local government ch 212 it is hereby declared by the city council that recreational areas in the form of municipal parks are necessary and in the public welfare and that the only adequate procedure to provide for municipal parks is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property or subdivision in the city whether such development consists of new construction on vacant land or rebuilding and remodeling of structures on existing residential property b municipal parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby the park zones established by the parks and recreation department and shown on the official parks and recreation map for the city shall be prima facie proof that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from any residence located therein the primary cost of municipal parks should be borne by the ultimate residential property owners who by reason of the proximity of their property to such parks shall be the primary beneficiaries of such facilities therefore this article is adopted to effect the purposes stated  9272005

by separate instrument in the form of a warranty deed approved by the city at the sole discretion of the city council b the city council declares that development of an area smaller than five acres

water suppliers required by rule to develop drought contingency plans vtca water 71 introduction and objectives a water supply has always been a key issue in the development of texas in recent years the growing population and economic development of north central texas has led to increasing demands for water supplies at the same time local and less expensive sources of water supply are largely developed additional supplies to meet higher demands will be expensive and difficult to develop it is therefore important that ntmwd and its member cities and customers make the most efficient use of existing supplies this will delay the need for new supplies minimize the environmental impacts associated with developing new supplies and delay the high cost of additional water supply development recognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies the texas commission on environmental quality tceq has developed guidelines and requirements governing the development of water conservation and drought contingency plans for public water suppliers 1 2 tceq guidelines and requirements are included in appendix b the best management practices established by the water conservation implementation task force 3  established pursuant to sb 1094 by the 78th legislature were also considered in the development of the water conservation measures the north texas municipal water district ntmwd has developed this model water conservation and drought contingency and water emergency response plan for its member cities and customers following tceq guidelines and requirements this model water conservation and drought contingency and water emergency response plan was developed in concert with the ntmwds water conservation and drought contingency and water emergency response plan 4 this model water conservation and drought contingency and water emergency response plan replaces the model plans dated august 2004 and april 2006 the water conservation sections of this plan include measures that are intended to result in ongoing longterm water savings the drought contingency and water emergency response sections of this plan address strategies designed to temporarily reduce water use in response to specific conditions b the objectives of this model water conservation plan are as follows 1 to reduce water consumption from the levels that would prevail without conservation efforts 2 to reduce the loss and waste of water 3 to improve efficiency in the use of water 4 to document the level of recycling and reuse in the water supply 5 to extend the life of current water supplies by reducing the rate of growth in demand c the water conservation plan presented in this document is a model water conservation plan intended for adoption by the ntmwd member cities and customers in order to adopt this plan each member city and customer will need to do the following 1 complete the water utility profile provided in appendix c 2 complete the annual water conservation implementation report in appendix i 3 set fiveyear and tenyear goals for per capita water use 4 adopt ordinances or regulations approving the model plan the water utility profile goals and ordinances or regulations should be provided to ntmwd in draft form for review and comments final adopted versions should also be provided to ntmwd as well as tceq this model plan includes all of the elements required by tceq some elements of this model plan go beyond tceq requirements any water supplier wishing to adjust elements of the plan should coordinate with ntmwd to the extent this model plan conflicts with any other drought contingency plans now existing or in the future adopted by the city this model plan shall control all appendices referenced herein are available

copy of which is included in appendix b for the purpose of these rules a drought contingency and water emergency response plan is defined as a strategy or combination of strategies for temporary supply and demand management responses to temporary and potentially recurring water supply shortages and other water supply emergencies 2 exh a 10112011 2 superscripted numbers match references listed in appendix a drought contingency and water emergency response plan a introduction the purpose of this model drought contingency and water emergency response plan is as follows 1 to conserve the available water supply in times of drought and emergency  2 to maintain supplies for domestic water use sanitation and fire protection  3 to protect and preserve public health welfare and safety  4 to minimize the adverse impacts of water supply shortages  5 to minimize the adverse impacts of emergency water supply conditions b the ntmwd supplies treated water to its member cities and customers this model plan was developed by ntmwd in consultation with its member cities in order to adopt this model plan each ntmwd member city and customer will need to adopt ordinances or regulations implementing the plan including the determination of fines and enforcement procedures the model plan calls for member cities and customers to adopt drought stages initiated by ntmwd during a drought or water supply emergency member cities and customers may also adopt more stringent drought or water emergency response stages than ntmwd if conditions warrant c drought defined a drought is defined as an extended period of time when an area receives insufficient amounts of rainfall to replenish the water supply causing water supply sources in this case reservoirs to be depleted in the absence of drought response measures water demands tend to increase during a drought due to the need for additional outdoor irrigation the severity of a drought depends on the degree of depletion of supplies and on the relationship of demand to available supplies the ntmwd considers a drought to end when all of its supply reservoirs refill to the conservation storage pool d state requirements for drought contingency and water emergency response plans this model drought contingency and water emergency response plan is consistent with texas commission on environmental quality guidelines and requirements

drought contingency and water emergency response plan and derived from exh a adopted  appendices aj referenced in  3exh a adopted  and referenced in this division are not included herein but are on file with the city commission editors note superscripted numbers match references listed in appendix a introduction and objectives water supply has always been a key issue in the development of texas in recent years the increasing population and economic development of north central texas have led to growing demands for water supplies at the same time local and less expensive sources of water supply are largely already developed additional supplies to meet future demands will be expensive and difficult to secure severe drought conditions in recent years have highlighted the importance of efficient use of our existing supplies to make them last as long as possible this will delay the need for new supplies minimize the environmental impacts associated with developing new supplies and delay the high cost of additional water supply development recognizing the need for efficient use of existing water supplies the texas commission on environmental quality tceq has developed guidelines and requirements governing the development of water conservation and drought contingency plans for wholesale water suppliers 2  the tceq guidelines and requirements for wholesale suppliers are included in appendix b the north texas municipal water district ntmwd has developed a model water conservation plan pursuant to tceq guidelines and requirements the best management practices established by the water conservation implementation task force 3 were also considered in the development of the water conservation measures the water conservation sections of the ntmwd model plan include measures that are intended to result in ongoing longterm water savings this plan replaces the previous plans dated august 200 april 2006 and march 2008 4  the objectives of this water conservation plan are as follows 1 to reduce water consumption from the levels that would prevail without conservation efforts 2 to reduce the loss and waste of water 3 to improve efficiency in the use of water 4 encourage efficient outdoor water use 5 to document the level of recycling and reuse in the water supply 6 to extend the life of current water supplies by reducing the rate of growth in demand the water conservation plan presented in this document is a model water conservation plan intended for adoption by the ntmwd member cities and customers in order to adopt this plan the city of wylie will need to do the following 1 complete the water utility profile provided in appendix c 2 complete the annual water conservation implementation report in appendix j 3 set fiveyear and tenyear goals for per capita water use 4 adopt ordinances or regulations approving the model plan the water utility profile goals and ordinances or regulations will be provided to ntmwd in draft form for

elements of water conservation is tracking water use and controlling losses diversions and leaks it is important to carefully meter water use detect and repair leaks in the distribution system and provide regular monitoring of real losses 1 accurate metering of treated water deliveries from ntmwd  water deliveries from ntmwd are metered by ntmwd using meters with accuracy of  percent these meters are calibrated on a monthly basis by ntmwd to maintain the required accuracy 2 metering of customer and public uses and meter testing repair and replacement  the provision of water to all customers including public and governmental users will continue to be metered by the city of wylie the city of wylie will test and replace their residential customer meters on a regular basis all residential customer meters will be budgeted and replaced on a minimum of a 15year cycle additionally large meters will be regularly tested on no less than a fiveyear interval and either maintained or replaced when their test flow is more than a three percent difference from actual flow 3 determination and control of water loss  total water loss is the difference between water delivered to the city of wylie from ntmwd and other supplies if applicable and metered water sales to customers plus authorized for use but not sold authorized for use but not sold would include use for firefighting releases for flushing of lines uses associated with new construction etc total water loss includes three categories a apparent losses  including inaccuracies in customer meters customer meters tend to run more slowly as they age and underreport actual use losses due to illegal connections and theft included in appendix h accounts which are being used but have not yet been added to the billing system b real losses  includes physical losses from the system or mains reported breaks and leaks storage overflow c unidentified water losses  system input  total authorized  apparent losses  real losses measures to control water loss will be part of the routine operations of the city of wylie maintenance crews and personnel will look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system a leak detection and repair program is described in section 114106a4 below meter readers will watch for and report signs of illegal connections so they can be quickly addressed total water loss should be calculated in accordance with the provisions of appendix j with the measures described in this plan the city of wylie should maintain water loss percentage below 12 percent in 2014 and subsequent years if total water loss exceeds this goal the city of wylie will implement a more intensive audit to determine the sources of and reduce the water loss the annual conservation report described below is the primary tool that should be used to monitor water loss 4 leak detection and repair  as described above city crews and personnel should look for and report evidence of leaks in the water distribution system areas of the water distribution system in which numerous leaks and line breaks occur should be targeted for replacement as funds are available 5 record management system  as required by tac title 30 subchapter a rule 2882a2b the city of wylie will maintain a record management system that allows for the separation of water sales and uses into residential commercial publicinstitutional and industrial categories this information will be included in an annual water conservation report as described in section 114107g below b continuing public education and information campaign  the continuing public education and information campaign on water conservation includes the following elements 1 utilize the water iq know your water and other public education materials produced by the ntmwd 2 insert water conservation information with water bills inserts will include material developed by member cities and customers staff and material obtained from the twdb the tceq and other sources 3 encourage local media coverage of water conservation issues and the importance of water conservation 4 notify local organizations schools and civic groups that member city or customer staff and staff of the ntmwd are available to make presentations on the importance of water conservation and ways to save water 5 promote the texas smartscape web site  wwwtxsmartscapecom  and provide water conservation brochures and other water conservation materials available to the public at city hall and other public places 6 make information on water conservation available on its website if applicable and include links to the water iq know your water website texas smartscape website and to information on water conservation on the twdb and tceq web sites and other resources 7 ntmwd is an epa water sense partner and participates in the epa water sense sponsored fix a leak week ntmwd encourages all member cities and customers to become epa water sense partners 8 utilize the water my yard website and encourage customers to signup to receive weekly watering advice c ntmwd system operation plan  the city of wylie purchases treated water from ntmwd and does not have surface water supplies for which to implement a system operation plan ntmwd operates multiple sources of water supply as a system the operation of the reservoir system is intended to optimize the use of the districts sources within the constraints of existing water rights while minimizing energy use cost for pumping maintaining water quality minimizing potential impacts on recreational users of the reservoirs and fish and wildlife d coordination with regional water planning group and ntmwd  appendix f includes a letter sent to the chair of the region c and region d water planning group with this model water conservation plan the city of wylie will send a copy of their draft ordinances or regulations implementing the plan and their water utility profile to ntmwd for review and comment the adopted ordinances or regulations and the adopted water utility profile will be sent to the chair of the appropriate water planning group and to ntmwd e requirement for water conservation plans by wholesale customers  every contract for the wholesale sale of water by the city of wylie that is entered into renewed or extended after the adoption of this water conservation plan will include a requirement that the wholesale customer and any wholesale customers of that wholesale customer develop and implement a water conservation plan meeting the requirements of title 30 subchapter a rule 2882 of the texas administrative requirement will also extend to each successive wholesale customer in the resale of the water the city of wylie does not currently contract for the resale of water to wholesale customers  3exh a 4222014 enhanced water conservation strategies a water rate structure  the city of wylie will continue to use an increasing block rate water structure that is intended to encourage water conservation and discourage excessive use and waste of water an example water rate structure suggested by the ntmwd model plan is provided below the current city of wylie rate structure is similar to the minimum requirements suggested by the ntmwd 1 residential rates  a monthly minimum charge  this can but does not have to include up to 2000 gallons water use with no additional charge b base charge per 1000 gallons up to the approximate average residential use c 2nd tier from the average to two times the approximate average at 125 to 20 times the base charge d 3rd tier above two times the approximate average at 125 to 20 times the 2nd tier e additional tiers with further increases if desired f the residential rate can also include a lower tier for basic household use up to 4000 gallons per month or a determined basic use 2 commercialindustrial rates  commercialindustrial rates should include at least 2 tiers with rates for the 2nd tier at 125 to 20 times the first tier higher water rates for commercial irrigation use are encouraged but not required b ordinances plumbing codes or rules on waterconserving fixtures  the state has required waterconserving fixtures in new construction and renovations since 1992 the state standards call for flows of no more than 25 gallons per minute gpm for faucets 25 gpm for showerheads and 16 gallons per flush for toilets similar standards are now required nationally under federal law these state and federal standards assure that all new construction and renovations will use waterconserving fixtures rebate programs to encourage replacement of older fixtures with water conservation programs are discussed in section 114107h c reuse and recycling of wastewater  most member cities and customers do not own and operate their own wastewater treatment plants their wastewater is treated by ntmwd ntmwd currently has the largest wastewater reuse program in the state ntmwd has water rights allowing reuse of up to 71882 acrefeet per year of this treated wastewater lake for municipal purposes in addition ntmwd has also developed the east fork raw water supply project which can divert up to 157393 acrefeet per year based on treated wastewater discharges by the ntmwd when fully developed these two reuse projects will provide up to 44 percent of the ntmwds currently permitted water supplies ntmwd also provides treated effluent from its wastewater treatment plants available for direct reuse for landscape irrigation and industrial use although the city of wylie does not operate its own wastewater treatment plant the ntmwd encourages those member cities and customers to move toward reusing treated effluent for irrigation purposes at their plant site over the next three years these entities should also seek other alternatives for reuse of recycled wastewater effluent d interactive weather stationswater my yard program  ntmwd has developed the water my yard program to install weather stations throughout its service area to provide consumers with a weekly email and information water my yard website in determining an adequate amount of supplemental water that is needed to maintain healthy grass in specific locations this service represents the largest network of weather stations providing etbased irrigation recommendations in the state of texas and provides the public advanced information regarding outdoor irrigation needs thereby reducing water use through a series of selections on the type of irrigation system a consumer has a weekly email is provided that will determine how long in minutes that an irrigation system needs to run based on the past seven days of weather this recommendation provides the actual amount of supplemental water that is required for a healthy lawn based on research of the texas a&m agrilife extension service and proven technologies this innovative program has been available to those within the ntmwd service area since may 2013 e compulsory landscape and water management measures  the following landscape water management measures are adopted for use by this plan these measures represent minimum measures to be implemented and enforced in order to irrigate the landscape appropriately and are to remain in effect on a permanent basis unless water resource management stages are declared 1 landscape water
