purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials it is recognized that adult businesses have a serious deleterious effect upon adjacent areas as well as the areas in which they are located it is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish standards for the conduct of adult businesses which will

effects of adult businesses a based on the foregoing studies and the other evidence presented the city council finds that 1 adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates of those areas in which they are located and that surround them  and 2both the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adult businesses tend to result in the blighting and downgrading of the areas in which they are located 3unregulated adult businesses create serious public health concerns and hazards since the studies and cases demonstrate that such businesses have been linked to the spread of communicable and sexuallytransmitted diseases 4 special regulation of adult businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to an increase in the crime rates or the blighting or downgrading of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas the need for special regulation is based on the recognition that adult businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to sensitive uses such as residential zones and uses parks schools churches or day care centers 5 it is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the establishment and operation of adult businesses in a manner that would create such adverse secondary effects thus in order to protect and preserve the public health safety and welfare of the citizenry especially minors special regulations are necessary 6the protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare require that certain operational requirements for adult businesses also be imposed bin adopting these regulations the city council is mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adult businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the first amendments of the united states and california constitutions but instead desires to enact reasonable time place and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses the city council has

follows ait is the purpose and intent of this chapter to provide for the orderly regulation of massage therapists and massage establishments in the interest of the public peace health safety and welfare as the city wishes both to recognize the practice of massage as a valid professional field and to discourage prostitution and other unlawful activities which otherwise have become associated with some massage establishments bbusinesses regulated by this chapter involve significant intimate contact between persons which creates opportunities for injury or other harm to persons acts of prostitution and other unlawful sexual or other activity to occur thus the permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this chapter are reasonably necessary to protect the public peace health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city of corona as well as those who frequent or are involved with the businesses regulated by this chapter cthe city of corona is authorized by virtue of the state constitution and cal govt et seq to regulate massage establishments by imposing certain minimum building sanitation and operation standards for such establishments dthere is a significant risk of injury to massage clients by improperly trained andor educated massage therapists and this chapter provides reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss by prohibiting any person from performing massage services unless such person is certified by the california massage therapy council ethere is opportunity for acts of prostitution and other unlawful sexual or other activity to occur in massage establishments courts have long recognized massage as a pervasively regulated activity and that it is not uncommon for massage establishments to be operated as brothels in disguise the establishment of reasonable standards for issuance of permits to operate a massage establishment and restrictions on operations would serve to reduce the risk of illegal activity fthe restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter reduce the burdens on the police department and permit the deployment of the police personnel such that other serious crimes may be prevented and other important laws enforced gthe regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter tend to discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of prostitution and the means utilized in this chapter bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved hthe regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter are consistent with all of the objectives policies general land uses programs and actions of all elements of the corona general plan and none of the proposed regulations conflict with current general plan ithe regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter are not detrimental to and are instead necessary to preserve and protect the public peace health safety and general welfare of the city its residents and businesses `78

requirements  waiver certificate of occupancy  declaration of necessity athe city council finds that the lack of sidewalks in the city forces school children and other pedestrians to walk in the streets and be subjected to the hazards of vehicular traffic the lack of sidewalks especially during rainy weather constitutes an immediate hazard to the health and safety of pedestrians and vehicles bexisting city streets alleys and highways streets which have inadequate width design and improvement constitute an immediate hazard to the health and safety of the users thereof including drivers users and passengers in ambulances fire and police vehicles sanitation trucks and equipment and to those occupants of the real property adjacent to the streets cthe lack of curbs gutters and improved streets in the city results in poor water drainage and causes the accumulation of filth and waste in such streets dbased on the foregoing it is found that the lack of adequate curbs gutters sidewalks and properly widened and improved streets and alleys is immediately dangerous to the public health safety and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants the general public and particularly to the occupants of property in the immediate vicinity thereof eit is further found by the city council that the lack of adequate street lights and necessary facilities appurtenant thereto street lights in and along the public streets of the city in accordance with the citys standards therefor and at appropriate locations in accordance with citys general plan therefor constitutes an immediate hazard to the public health safety and general welfare of the city its residents and the general public by reason of the following the absence of such street lights and lighting emanating therefrom encourages the commission of those crimes commonly known as street crimes such as personal assault attempted or actual rape robbery theft of or stripping of accessories from motor vehicles motorcycles and bicycles and burglaries and attempted burglaries of buildings and structures located in those areas not having street lights nearby additionally this lack of street lights diminishes the visibility necessary for safe nighttime operation of vehicles on the public streets and particularly the vision of drivers of emergency vehicles such as ambulances police and fire vehicles traveling under excessive time pressure and having a need to determine immediately the location and identification of buildings streets intersections private property accessways and existence of any barriers in such streets fit is further found that immediate danger to the health safety and welfare of the city its residents and the general public is created by the lack of adequate fire hydrants which by reason of their substandard conditions do not meet the citys standards therefor or are not located as noted by the citys general plan therefor the lack or inadequacy of fire hydrants causes the citys fire suppression personnel excessive delay or total inability to suppress certain fires by reason of absence of proper water pressure or the excessive distance for the proper utilization of hoses and other equipment to suppress a fire the results of such delay or inability causes a hazard not only to the building or structure which is the immediate subject of attention but also all persons property and improvements in the immediate vicinity of such building git is further found that the erection construction placement installation replacement relocation enlargement or addition of and to any structure or building as described in  a or the occupancy thereof creates a burden on the city in general and the immediate local neighborhood in which the building or structure is proposed by reason of increasing traffic problems and imposing additional and more intensified obligations of service by the city including but not limited to fire prevention and suppression law enforcement street improvement maintenance and repair and engineering thereof in order to protect the health safety and welfare of not only the general public but the occupants of the buildings their guests and permittees and the local neighborhood in which they are located hit is further found that the improvements required to be constructed or charges required to be paid in lieu thereof by the provisions of this chapter will constitute a direct benefit to those properties and the owners or occupants thereof and their guests and permittees by enabling the city to provide an efficient vehicular circulation and street system and safe operation thereof and proper law enforcement and fire protection and suppression services to and for such persons and their property `78   1994   1 1977

constructed placed and installed above the surface of the ground for the following reasons apoles wires and associated structures which are constructed placed or installed above the surface of the ground are a hazard to the safety and health of operators of motor vehicles and passengers therein since they constitute encroachments which reduce and obstruct the vision of such operators and thereby preclude a reasonable response time by an operator to an emergency situation after noticing such the poles wires and associated structures are a danger to fire suppression and prevention personnel street maintenance and utility personnel who by reason of their jobs and duties frequently come in close proximity thereto particularly when using ladders booms and cranes the construction placement and installation of such wires and associated structures underground will substantially reduce the hazards  bthe poles wires and associated structures also create dangerous situations causing death injuries and property damage electrocution by reason of being toppled tipped and otherwise displaced by uncontrolled weather elements such as rain wind sleet snow and electrical storms the hazards will be substantially eliminated by the construction placement and installation of the wires and associated structures underground  cthe location of the poles wires and associated structures above the ground surface makes them susceptible to damage destruction and being rendered inoperable by weather or human causation this results in services provided thereby to be interrupted the uninterrupted continuation of which is vitally needed for the protection of the public health safety and general welfare particularly life saving institutions such as hospitals and fire and law enforcement communication facilities the construction placement and installation of the wires and associated structures underground reduces the chances of such interruption  dthe existence of poles wires and associated structures above the ground is detrimental to the general welfare of the city by its blight on the natural beauty and aesthetic environment of the city and the resulting interference with the restfulness tranquillity and pleasure of city residents in viewing the natural landscape of the city the underground installation placement and construction of wires and associated structures will enhance and preserve the natural beauty and landscape of the city by keeping from public view such functional but nonaesthetic facilities `78   definitions whenever the

riverside county transportation uniform mitigation fee program   2017   2009   2006   2003  findings athe city is a member agency of the western riverside council of governments wrcog a joint powers agency comprised of the county of riverside and 18 cities located in western riverside county acting in concert the wrcog member agencies developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional system of highways and arterials in western riverside county the regional system could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee tumf on future residential commercial and industrial development a map depicting the boundaries of western riverside county and the regional system is attached as exhibit a to the enacting this chapter and is incorporated herein as a member agency of wrcog and as a tumf participating jurisdiction the city participated in the preparation of a certain western riverside county transportation uniform fee nexus study dated  the nexus study prepared in compliance with the mitigation fee act california government et seq and adopted by the wrcog executive committee based on the 2002 nexus study the city adopted and implemented an ordinance authorizing the citys participation in a tumf program bwrcog with the assistance of tumf participating jurisdictions has prepared an updated nexus study entitled transportation uniform mitigation fee nexus study 2016 update  nexus study pursuant to california government et seq the mitigation fee act for the purpose of updating the fees on  the wrcog executive committee reviewed the 2016 nexus study and tumf program and recommended tumf participating jurisdictions amend their applicable tumf ordinances to reflect changes in the tumf network and the cost of construction in order to update the tumf program cconsistent with its previous findings made in the adoption of the ordinances enacting this chapter the city council has been informed and advised and hereby finds that if the capacity of the regional system is not enlarged and unless development contributes to the cost of improving the regional system the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of western riverside county with unacceptable levels of service furthermore the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional system will substantially impair the

welfare of all the citizens of corona by reducing the adverse effects of urbanization and development bit is necessary to enact and implement certain development fees to assure that all development within the city pays its fair share of the costs of providing necessary public facilities and infrastructure to accommodate such new development ca proper funding source for the costs associated with new development is a specific development or facilities fee for each type of facility related to the specific need created by the development and reasonably related to the relative cost of providing such necessary public facilities dthe development impact report and the addendum thereto justify the imposition of each development fee on new construction by analyzing the master facility plan as defined herein assigning the costs on a fairshare basis to the various types of development and assigning the resulting fee per dwelling unit andor commercialindustrial square footage based on the anticipated burden of such new dwelling unit andor commercialindustrial area on city facilities and infrastructure and the need created by such dwelling unit andor commercialindustrial area for new and expanded facilities and infrastructure ethe city anticipates that much of the funding for facilities and infrastructure attributable to commercial and industrial development will be provided such as property tax sales tax measure a funds community development block grants gas tax redevelopment tax increment intergovernmental revenues grants planned local drainage fund and conditions of entitlement approval nevertheless the development impact report identifies that commercial and industrial development do generate a portion of the need for certain facilities and infrastructure fthe primary purpose of the fees is to mitigate the impact on city facilities and infrastructure caused by increased demand for facilities and infrastructure from persons generated by new development gthe fees will be used to finance public facilities and infrastructure specifically streets roadways and traffic signals drainage facilities and infrastructure law enforcement and fire protection facilities library facilities public meeting facilities aquatic center facilities and park and recreation facilities hthe use of the fees to fund such public facilities and infrastructure is

including without limitation findings that in the case of deferral 1other properties to be benefitted by any fee will not be burdened by the review and delay in fee imposition   2alternative financing methods involving more than one owner have been proposed for review  and 3delay will result in a more fair funding arrangement  and in the case of waiver the owner will receive little or no benefit from the fee imposed and would therefore be required if the fee were imposed to pay more than his or her fair share for the benefit received `78   1999   1990   part 1989 appendix asouth corona

school land dedications `78   part 1984  school district findings and city council concurrence the governing body of the coronanorco unified school district has made findings pursuant to cal govt which findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence that conditions of overcrowding exist in one or more attendance areas within the district which will impair the normal functioning of educational programs in that district and that all reasonable methods of mitigating these conditions of overcrowding have been evaluated by the school board and no feasible method for reducing such conditions exists after considerable deliberation and study the city council concurs in these findings by the coronanorco unified school district board of trustees this chapter is therefore adopted pursuant to cal govt to establish an interim method of providing classroom facilities where overcrowding conditions exist within the coronanorco unified school district `78   part 1984  general plan finding the corona general plan provides for the location of public schools and this city council finds that the facilities to be constructed from the fees paid or the land dedicated pursuant to this chapter are consistent with the corona general plan `78   part 1984  limitations any land or fees received by the school district pursuant to these provisions shall be used only for the purpose of providing interim elementary or high school classroom and related facilities as defined by state law the location and amount of land to be dedicated or the amount of fees to be paid shall bear a

by the residential development being assessed however as required by state law any fees collected shall not exceed the amount necessary to pay five annual lease payments for the interim classroom and

development has entered into an agreement with the school district providing for mitigation of the districts conditions of overcrowding which would otherwise be aggravated by the proposed residential development  2in the judgment of the city council there are specific overriding fiscal economic social or environmental factors which will benefit the city thereby justifying the approval of a residential development otherwise subject to the provisions of this chapter without requiring dedication of land or payment of fees  or 3if both the city and the school district have approved conditions covenants and restrictions of record which prohibit the residence of minor children in the proposed residential development `78   part 1984  amount of fee the amount of any school facilities fee collected by the school district pursuant to this chapter shall be set by resolution of the city council after full consultation with the affected school district this amount shall bear a reasonable relationship to the needs of the community for interim elementary junior high and high school facilities and shall be based upon those needs and upon the need for schools caused by the particular residential development the amount shall not exceed that necessary to pay five annual lease payments for such interim facilities `78   part 1984  dedications upon mutual agreement between the residential developer the city and the school district the developer may dedicate land in lieu of paying fees pursuant to this chapter the fair market value of the land so dedicated shall be equivalent to the amount of fees which would otherwise be required when land is to be dedicated it shall be deeded directly to the school district if dedicated land is subsequently determined by the school district to be unsuitable for school purposes it may be sold by the school district and the proceeds applied to interim school facilities `78   part 1984  exactions earmarked all exactions

the end of each reporting period as well as on the facilities leased purchased or constructed during that reporting period in addition this report shall specify where conditions of overcrowding will continue to exist during the subsequent year the report shall be filed by april 15 and october 15 of each year `78   part 1984 chapter 1627 mitigation of local school impaction of need findings of benefit with mitigation policy reserved powers restrictions and requirements on school districts amount of fee effective date  findings of need in addition to the requirements of the boards of trustees of both the coronanorco unified school district and the alvord unified school district have requested assistance to help ameliorate what they assert to be the adverse effects of new residential developments on their educational facilities and services this council finds that in the absence of such assistance from developers of new residential subdivisions within the city of corona the coronanorco and alvord unified school districts will not have sufficient financial and other resources to provide adequate educational facilities and services to this citys residents and that therefore without such mitigating assistance such new residential developments would be inconsistent with the citys general plan would not comply with the california environmental quality act and would be inimical to the health and general welfare of city residents `78   part 1984  findings of benefit with mitigation this council also finds that new residential growth with proper mitigation of educational and other impacts can be beneficial to this citys existing economy and residents `78   part 1984  policy this council therefore establishes the following policy no tentative tract map

until its developers and either the coronanorco or the alvord unified school district have agreed in writing to a means by which the impaction caused by the construction and occupation of such project will be adequately mitigated and that any such subdivision or other permit for development approved by the planning commission be so conditioned to require such mitigation `78   part 1984  reserved powers nothing herein shall be construed as a delegation of the councils power and responsibility to determine the issue of mitigation of adverse environmental effects the council specifically reserves all rights provided to it by law including the right to determine from time to time by resolution the maximum dollar amount per residential unit which may be required to be paid as mitigation hereunder the right to determine any class of residential units to be exempted from the requirement of such mitigation because of special factual circumstances or the right to establish varying amounts of fees for certain types of development because of special factual circumstances `78   part 1984  restrictions and requirements on school districts the city council reserves the right to suspend the operation of this chapter during any period in which the coronanorco or alvord unified school district fails to aestablish and maintain a separate accounting fund in which all payments received as mitigation of school impaction shall be held inviolate until properly expended  bexpend such funds only for the construction of school capital facilities  and caccount periodically at least once each year for all sums received for school impact mitigation all sums expended from such mitigation fund and all amounts remaining in the fund `78   part 1984  amount of fee unless

therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish criteria and standards for the establishment and conduct of adult businesses which will protect the public health safety and welfare preserve locally recognized values of community appearance minimize the potential for nuisances related to the operation of adult businesses and maintain local property values it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish proper regulations and to provide for a reasonable number of approximately located sites for adult businesses within the city based upon the following findings a the city council has reviewed the detailed studies reports and letters prepared by other jurisdictions and its own staff with respect to the detrimental social health and economic effects on persons and properties surrounding adult businesses these studies included upland california 1992  garden grove california 1991  tucson arizona 1990  seattle washington 1989  austin texas 1986  oklahoma city oklahoma 1986

studies a summary of which is attached hereto as exhibit a substantiate the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses b based on the foregoing studies and the other evidence presented the city council finds that 1 adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates of those areas in which they are located and that surround them  and 2both the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adult businesses tend to result in the blighting and downgrading of the areas in which they are located c the studies conducted in various communities in other jurisdictions have demonstrated that the proximity and concentration of adult businesses adjacent to residential recreational religious educational or other adult businesses can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere dthe studies conducted in various communities in other jurisdictions have demonstrated that adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates and blighting of those areas in which they are located and that surround them ethe special regulation of adult businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to an increase in the crime rates or the blighting or downgrading of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas the need for the special regulation is based on the recognition that adult businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity with sensitive uses such as residential zones and uses parks schools churches or day care centers thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas fit is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration or location of adult businesses in a manner that would create such adverse secondary effects thus in order to protect and preserve the public health safety and welfare of the citizenry especially including minors the special regulation of the time place and manner of the location and operation of adult businesses is necessary gthe protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare require that certain distances be maintained between adult businesses and residential uses and zones churches schools day care centers parks and other adult businesses hthe need to regulate the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses such as residential religious educational recreational and other adult businesses are documented in studies conducted by other jurisdictions as listed elsewhere in this section ithe report of the state of minnesota attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  indicated that 1community impacts of sexually oriented businesses are primarily a function of two variables proximity to residential areas and concentration property values are directly affected within a small radius typically one block of the location of a sexually oriented business concentration may compound depression of property values and may lead to an increase of crime sufficient to change the quality of life and perceived desirability of property in a neighborhood  and 2the impacts of sexually oriented businesses are exacerbated when they are located near each other when sexually oriented businesses have multiple uses such as theater bookstore nude dancing peep booths one building can have the impact of several separate businesses j in consideration of the findings of the report of the state of minnesota attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated  it is appropriate to prohibit the concentration of multiple adult businesses within one building in order to mitigate the compounded adverse secondary effects associated with such concentrations as described above k the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexuallyoriented materials that are protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution and the relevant provisions of the california state constitution l the proposed parking standards are necessary in the interests of the public health safety and welfare to provide for an appropriate

regulations in this chapter do not preclude reasonable alternative avenues of communication the city council takes note of the proximity of at least 12 adult businesses within 30 minutes drive time of

city council recognizes that a sufficient number of appropriate locations for establishing an adult business in the city are provided considering the citys predominant residential character more than 60% of land within corona is zoned for residential land use the fact that there is already one adult business sited in the city angels gentlemens club and the fact that no formal requests to establish

standards  purpose  intent  construction athe purpose of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive and uniform set of standards and procedures for the placement design installation and permitting of telecommunications facilities consistent with applicable federal and state requirements the regulations contained herein are designed to protect and promote the public health safety and welfare and aesthetic quality and character of the city as set forth in the goals objectives and policies of the citys general plan while at the same time not unduly restricting the placement design installation and management of the telecommunications infrastructure within the city for the provision of advanced and competitive telecommunications services this chapter is not intended to and does not regulate those aspects of telecommunications facilities that are governed by the federal communications commission fcc to the extent that any provision of this chapter conflicts with any final adopted rules or regulations of the fcc this chapter shall be implemented consistent with such rules and regulations of the fcc bthe city council finds that typically satellite antennas are larger in size surface area and weight than other types of antennas used for telecommunications services because of the unique seismic activity and wind loadings prevalent in the region satellite antennas mounted or braced on buildings mounted on freestanding poles or mounted on roofs pose a unique threat to the structural safety of buildings and to the public in general these threats necessitate careful attention to the location height and method of installation in order to avoid injury to persons and property from fallen or windblown satellite antenna in addition other location restrictions and standards are necessary because satellite antennas depending on their size which are placed adjacent to public rightsofway or locations accessible to the public can create a tripping hazard block views to create a visibility hazard for motorists andor create an attractive nuisance cthe city council recognizes that under  101 and 207 of the 1996 telecommunications act 47 usc  253 the fcc has partially preempted local regulation of satellite antennas and receiveonly antennas 47 cfr   the federal limitations on local regulation of small and medium size satellite antennas and receiveonly antennas are set forth in   with permissible conditions and limitations imposed to reduce the safety risks identified in this section in addition where the city is authorized by federal law and this chapter to exercise discretion in regulating satellite antennas such regulatory decisions must have a reasonable and clearly defined health safety and aesthetic objective may not materially limit reception of telecommunications services may not impose excessive costs on the users of satellite antennas in relationship to the purchase and installation cost and may not create unfair competition among telecommunication services providers dthe city council finds that the regulations and design standards set forth in this chapter are necessary to protect the public health safety welfare and aesthetic interests and the enforcement thereof will not result in the imposition of excessive costs on users of satellite antennas in relationship to the purchase and installation cost the city council finds further that these regulations and design standards neither materially limit a persons ability to receive telecommunications services nor create unfair competition among telecommunications service providers ethe city council recognizes that  704 of the 1996 telecommunications act 47 usc 332c preempts local regulation of the placement construction and modification of telecommunications facilities on the basis of the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the applicable fcc regulations fthe provisions of this chapter in particular   are intended to comply with of the middle class tax relief and job creation act of 2012 47 usc  1455 and the fcc rule on acceleration of broadband deployment by improving wireless facilities site policies 47 cfr   gthe provisions of this chapter are not intended and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or to have the effect of prohibiting telecommunications services this chapter shall not be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent telecommunications services hto the extent that any provision of this chapter is inconsistent or conflicts with any other city ordinance or provision of the code this chapter shall control  otherwise this chapter shall be construed consistently with the provisions and

this section is to regulate noise and vibration in the interest of the public health safety and general welfare the city finds that certain noise levels and vibrations are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare and that the primary sources of noise in the city are freeways highways manufacturing uses railroads the airport and construction noise the noise element of the general plan contains the citys policies regarding noise and identifies noise contours for existing and future roadways and the corona municipal airport which are implemented by this chapter the general plan noise element shall govern all noise standards and policies 2in order to control unnecessary excessive and annoying noise and vibration in the city it is hereby declared to be the policy of the city to prohibit such noise and vibration generated from or by all sources as specified in this chapter it shall be the policy of the city to maintain quiet in those areas which exhibit low noise levels and to implement programs to reduce noise in those areas within the city where noise levels are above acceptable values it is the intent of the city to minimize noise impacts to adjacent land uses pursuant to the standards identified herein bdefinitions terms found in this chapter shall be defined as follows additional definitions are found in the noise element of the general plan 1aweighted sound level the sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound level meter using the aweighted filter network the aweighted filter network is designed to simulate the response of the human ear the aweighted sound level is expressed by the symbol dba 2ambient noise the composite of noise from all existing sources near and far the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location excluding any alleged offensive noise 3cumulative period an additive period of time composed of individual time segments which may be continuous or interrupted 4community noise equivalent level cnel the average equivalent aweighted sound level during a 24 hour day obtained after addition of five decibels to sound levels between  pm and  pm and the addition of ten decibels to sound levels between  pm and  am 5decibel db a unit for measuring the amplitude of a sound equal to 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measured to the reference pressure which is 20 micropascals 6impulsive noise a noise of short duration usually less than one second and of high intensity with an abrupt onset and rapid decay 7noise study an acoustical analysis performed by a qualified noise engineer which determines the potential noise impacts of a roadway land use or operation of equipment the noise study will generate noise contours and recommend mitigation for noise impacts which exceed the citys noise standards 8sensitive land uses those specific land uses which have associated human activities that may be subject to stress or significant interference from noise sensitive land uses include single family residential multiple family residential churches hospitals and similar health care institutions convalescent homes libraries and school classroom areas 9 simple tone noise a noise characterized by a predominant frequency or frequencies so that other frequencies cannot be readily distinguished when measured a simple tone noise shall exist if the onethird octave band sound pressure levels in the band with the tone exceeds the arithmetic average of the sound pressure levels of

ordinance identifies two separate types of noise sources transportation and stationary transportation related noise sources such as freeways airports and railroads are identified within this chapter and are mainly for the planning stages of project development the noise metrics used for this noise type is the community noise equivalent level cnel which is a 24 hour time weighted average noise level the other type of noise standard is for stationary noise sources such as industrial or construction noise that may be intrusive to a neighboring private property the noise metric used for stationary sources is defined as noise levels that cannot be exceeded for certain percentages of time the noise standards shown in table 1 are for regulating the impact of stationary noise sources to
