within the mx district the primary entrance to a building shall be located facing the public street entrances at a building corner that faces the street may be used to meet this requirement buffers fences and walls the intent in having special buffer fence and wall requirements is to provide quality separation between incompatible commercial uses and to provide physical and visual protection between commercial and residential uses landscape buffers are preferred over fences and walls where a separation is desirable a visually open look should be encouraged between similar uses visual screening is often more important than a physical separation and the planning commission may at its own option require special treatment of such areas buffer treatment may be required whenever a change occurs between residential and nonresidential uses additional landscaping and screening may be required at the discretion of the planning commission within the setback which separates the uses fences or walls will be reviewed for their effectiveness in screening a view and for their color and texture in relationship to building materials where differing uses are to be developed adjacent to

of noise and artificial lighting shall be minimized to protect existing residents service areas shall be properly screened outdoor lighting shall be designed to prevent exposure of light source to the

circulation patterns the placing of building and parking elements on a site shall be evaluated by the planning commission on the basis of the following factors type of land use and structure building height and configuration relationship to other buildings both horizontally and vertically natural land features such as slopes and vegetation physical features such as rail lines canals and controlled ingress and egress visibility from vehicular approaches and distant highways parking locations are strongly encouraged on the side and to the rear of any proposed structures with minimum parking between the front of the building and the street cooperation among neighboring land owners and tenants to share parking for the public andor employees is encouraged the availability of shared parking may be used as a justification for the approval of development design and configuration proposals that would otherwise not be approved parking shall not occur adjacent to any public street except when it has been established that such a location is needed or justified by other site or building entrance orientation the use is restricted to visitors andor key employees parking is 80% screened by fencing walls andor landscaping from the highway or street by either depressing the paved areas or using elevated landscape berms a minimum of 10 feet of landscaped screening consisting of mixed evergreen and deciduous trees shall surround the periphery of paved areas adjacent to buildings or property lines the number of trees for this area shall be determined by a standard of 1 tree per every 200 square feet of landscaping required parking requirements will be considered as maximum parking requirements residential units will require at least one and a half spaces per unit non

appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain manager in the enforcement or administration of this person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal authority may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction the floodplain manager shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to fema and the state office of emergency management upon issuing a variance variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing the relevant factors in d2 of this been fully considered variances may also be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on lots larger that onehalf acre or more as the lot size increases beyond the onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this ordinance the appeal authority may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this  variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result or the appeal authority finds that refusing the variance would result in the taking or damaging of private property for a public purpose without the payment of just compensation variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure prerequisites for granting variances in addition to the requirements for variances listed elsewhere in this shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief or is necessary to avoid the taking or damaging of private property for a public purpose without the payment of just compensation variances shall only be issued upon showing a good and sufficient cause  determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant and determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances any application to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
