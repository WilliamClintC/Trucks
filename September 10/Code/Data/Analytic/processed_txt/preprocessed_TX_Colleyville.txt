adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain as follows  8409 findings of fact the city council hereby finds and declares that 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  8409 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  8409 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading

deposit or estimate a refund of overpayment will be immediately made to the person from whom the deposit was received each single customer shall also be responsible for paying for cost and accomplishing the tapping of the sewer main or lateral and installation of the required tapping saddle service sewer and house sewer all materials used and methods of construction shall be in full compliance with the latest specifications as adopted by the city and the applicable ordinances of the city the person or persons actually performing the installation of the service sewer must be properly licensed plumbers in accordance with city requirement and shall obtain all permits particularly including a permit from the city prior to tapping the citys lateral sewer or other sewer and no sewer service installation will be considered as acceptable for service unless and until the installation has been inspected and approved by a representative of the city prior to and after completion of the trench backfill the permit of the city as evidenced by a copy of the receipt for payment of the connection charge shall be in possession of the person performing the installation of the service connection and shall be exhibited to the citys superintendent or inspector at his request system extensions to serve single customers or groups of independent single customers general this section shall apply only to single customers or groups of independent customers requiring system extensions to provide for connecting to the citys sewer and water systems including subdivisions which have not previously been served by city sewers but excluding extensions for subdivisions which are covered in section 6 the city will extend its water distribution main a distance of not more than 50 feet per connection in any dedicated street or alley without additional cost to the customer above the standard connection charges covered in section 4 the city will extend lateral sewers or sewer mains only upon the payment of actual costs by the customer as provided in section 4 should one or more single customers desire service which necessitates an extension of more than 50 feet per water connection or an extension of lateral sewers or sewer mains such customers may advance the funding required with provision for future refunding as additional customers pay for connecting to the system by the procedure set forth under section 5b following the city does not commit to a policy of funding system extensions from surplus revenues bond funds or other public sources of funds  however in the event such funds become available the city reserves the right to do so at its sole discretion in such cases priority of projects will be based upon the wellbeing of the public relative to health and sanitation as well as the willingness of the customers involved to participate in the cost method of procedure where one or more single customers desires to advance the funding necessary for the city to extend either its water or sewer systems or both to satisfy the requirements for points of service for their property they shall make the request to the city secretary in writing stating the lot and block number name of subdivision and street address of the property to be served and the type or types of service required each request shall be signed by all property owners initially requesting service and their signatures shall be identified with the property they desire to be served upon receipt of such request the city secretary will instruct the citys engineers to prepare an estimate of the cost of the extension to satisfy the requested point of service which shall include the actual cost of construction together with the cost of the repair of all streets and other public utilities required by the construction the estimated amount of construction as determined above for extending the distribution mains lateral sewers or sewer mains for the requesting customers plus the meter deposit prescribed for each of the initial customers requiring the extension as set forth in section 4 shall be deposited with the city by the individuals in proportions determined as hereinafter provided before construction is initiated by the city the city shall pay for the engineering administration field surveys and other contingencies each single customer participating in the system extensions under this section of the citys policies shall execute a written agreement with the city setting forth in detail the location extent total and single customer cost of the extensions and the name and address of the person to whom refunds are payable after all required deposits are posted with the city the applicants may stipulate that competitive bids be received from private contractors for performing the extensions otherwise it will be left to the option of the city whether the work is to be let by competitive bids or performed by the city forces for the amount of the estimate if bids are received on the work the amounts of the deposit will be adjusted by additional collections or refunds to the actual contract cost plus the applicable meter deposits such adjustments shall be made upon the completion of the work and prior to connecting the customer for service determination of proportions of extension charges assigned to respective individuals participating in extensions by groups where groups of single customers join together to accomplish system extensions for service provided above the proportion of the cost assigned to each participating customer shall be determined as follows 1 the participating customers cost shall be computed as follows the individual customers front footage divided by the summation of all the participating customers front footages receiving point of service by the extension project multiplied times multiplied by the total cost of street repairs other repairs and appurtenances 2 in addition to the extension costs thus determined the customers shall also pay the meter deposits provided for in section 4 and provide their own sewer service line andor water connection to the meter in the event an individual has prepaid to the city the sewer service connection fee pursuant to the policy established by the city heretofore the city shall pay that individuals share of the participants total extension cost subsequent connections to extensions paid for by single customers or groups of single customers as intermediate customers between the last previous point of service and the extended point of service request and pay the standard connection charges plus extension charges as required to satisfy the intermediate customers point of service requirement refunds will be made to the customers who paid for the extension until the full amount advanced to the city for the extension has been repaid refunds shall be made to the initial customer within 30 days after the new customer connection charges have been paid to the city and shall be divided among the initial participants in the same proportion as their participation in the extension no refunds will be made five years after the construction of the extension project has been completed nor shall refunds of less than $2500 per participating customer be made  alternate extension procedure available to permit the extension of sanitary sewer mains to serve existing residences the city may extend sanitary sewers to service new areas previously not served when the city determines that such extension is in the best interest of the public and the city 1 conditional requirements the city may require as a condition the following a a petition signed and submitted by 60 percent of the property owners requesting sewer service  andor b acceptable binding commitments andor deposits of funds sufficient to pay for 60 percent of the extension costs as estimated by the citys consulting engineer before authorization of the extension 2 access charges access fees will be charged as follows a per tap available to all properties affected by the line extension and not otherwise served by sanitary sewer limited to one tap per platted lot or tract b per tap access fee shall be computed by one of the following two methods i ten dollars per front foot as defined in section 1 hereof for front footage and as may be revised hereafter by resolution necessary to address changes in construction costs provided further that the front footage fee shall not be less than $100000 nor more than $200000 additional taps for system access requested after the original computation as determined herein shall be the same as would have been charged otherwise ii where lots are uniform in front footage and the equity of the individual case indicates that a single fee may be the most appropriate and efficient method of assessment the city council may act to adopt a per tap access fee based on an equal distribution of cost to be assessed to property owners for the extension project the formula per tap access fee shall be the number of front footages times $1000 divided by the number of lots or tracts abutting the sewer line no of front footages  $1000 total no of lotstracts   per tap access fee iii where the per tap access fee computed under part i hereof would exceed $150000 the city council may in lieu of charging the access fee provided for in part i hereof establish a fee of $150000 regardless of the additional cost necessary to serve the property in question  5394 c subsequent additional taps within the line extension limits shall be charged the same access fees as apply to those initially receiving sewer service as a result of a sewer extension 3 payment method customers shall be required to pay their per tap access fee in full prior to connecting the customers service line to the city sewer main unless otherwise allowed as provided for herein customers unable to pay in full prior to accessing the citys sewer main may be allowed to pay out their access charge when a an application for such payment method is completed and submitted on forms provided and approved by the city manager or his designee  b an interest charge of 912 percent per annum shall be charged for the payment period required  c maximum payment period offered shall be 60 months  and d the city reserves the option under such approved time payment method to bill with utility bills by separate statement or with authorized bank drafts executed by the sewer customers provided further that the city manager is authorized to waive andor revise payment methods

designed in accordance with the city of colleyville drainage master plan or as determined by the director of public works b runoff calculations  the selection of which method to use for calculating runoff depends upon the size of the contributing drainage area at the most downstream point of the project the rational method is acceptable for designing projects in which the drainage area is less than onehundred 100 acres a unit hydrograph method is required for projects with larger drainage areas 1 no matter which method is used to calculate runoff a developer or builder of residential property greater than one 1 acre in size or any property that was platted as a part of an overall tract which was greater than one 1 acre in size including churches and schools shall develop the property so that the rate of runoff created by the development as it leaves the property does not exceed the rate of runoff that is currently occurring in the existing conditions a developer or builder of commercial property greater than onehalf 12 acre must follow the above guidelines 2 runoff computations shall be based upon fully developed watershed conditions in accordance with the land use projections in the latest comprehensive land use plan for the city of colleyville the design engineer shall size drainage facilities by disregarding the detention effects of upstream property and calculating the runoff as if the offsite property was developed without any detention if an approved regional detentionretention facility is in operation the design engineer may size downstream drainage facilities based on consideration of the detention effects of the regional facility c drainage areas less than onehundred acres 1 computation of storm water runoff for drainage areas less than onehundred 100 acres shall be by the rational method which is based on the principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all

the small onsite detention facilities for maintaining the rate of runoff as if the property was undeveloped the detention effects of large regional detention facilities can be taken into account in unit hydrograph methods 3 circumstances that may require the use of a unit hydrograph method include sizing open channels reclaiming floodplains creating lakes or building other types of drainagerelated facilities on major drainage courses design engineers of these types of facilities should be aware that the requirement of designing for fully developed watershed conditions will mean that they will have to calculate these fully developed flows instead of using the flows calculated in the federal emergency management colleyville texas land development  engineering design standards
