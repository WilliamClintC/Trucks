the interim services fee imposed for additional city services pursuant to this article shall be proportionate to the cost of the services benefitting new development for the period of time commencing

large by interfering with the safe movement of normal vehicular traffic  and 2 according to the florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles 2007 florida traffic crash statistics report five hundred thirty 530 pedestrians were killed on florida roadways in 2007  sixtyfive 65 of those pedestrians were killed on roadways in broward county  and 3 as reported in the usdot national highway traffic safety administrations june 2008 national pedestrian crash report the city of miramar experienced four 4 pedestrian crash deaths in 2006 alone 4 based upon statistics collected by the surface transportation policy project the miamifort lauderdale area is one 1 of the most dangerous areas in the united states for pedestrians  and 5 numerous types of rightofway canvassers and solicitors may seek to operate within the city of miramar including but not limited to children adolescents and adults who seek to collect money for school and community activities  vendors who sell flowers newspapers and other products  and people who seek donations or distribute written information  and 6 rightofway canvassers and solicitors approach motorists and passengers in motor vehicles engaged in travel on roads and are particularly susceptible and vulnerable to serious injury or death due to the speed and number of motorists who operate vehicles on busy roads within the city  and 7 roads are primarily designed for vehicular traffic and are not suited to safely accommodate rightofway canvassers and solicitors  and 8 according to a local newspaper article published in 200 twentynine 29 rightofway canvasserssolicitors have been seriously injured and at least fourteen 14 more have been killed by motor vehicles during a fifteenyear period  many of those deaths occurred while the canvassersolicitor was sitting or standing in a median or on the side of the street including a sunsentinel newspaper vendor who was struck by a car while carrying papers on us 1 and broward boulevard in fort lauderdale on   a miami herald newspaper vendor who was standing on the median at federal highway and stirling road on   and a miami herald newspaper vendor who was selling papers on

frequently includes complex vehicle turn movements that demand a drivers strict attention  and 12 it is the intention of the city commission to use the least restrictive means to advance the significant governmental interests of traffic safety and public safety and consequently the city staff analyzed each of the major roads within the city and determined that the roads listed in subsection b below present an increased and significant danger for use by distracted drivers pedestrians and rightofway canvassers and solicitors and pose the greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use by rightofway canvassers and solicitors and therefore the city commission has determined that such activities and use by rightofway vendors and solicitors shall be prohibited on the roads listed in subsection b  and 13 it is the finding of the city commission that many other alternative channels of communication other than rightofway canvassing and solicitation on the prohibited roadways exist for persons who seek to exercise their first amendment freedoms such as but by no means limited to solicitation of funds or distribution of literature mail or at alternate locations such as houses of worship shopping areas and special events  the sale andor distribution of newspapers or office delivery vending machines and retail stores  and the sale of goods and services at retail stores internet and from vending machines  and 14 the city commission desires to preserve and protect the personal safety and quality of life of its residents and of those who use streets within the city both pedestrians and motorists alike  and 15 the city commission has reviewed the proposed regulations provided by this section and finds that such regulations accomplish the purposes intended while utilizing the least restrictive means  and 16 the city commission finds that it is in the best interests of the residents of the city to adopt this section b

purpose of these regulations is to promote the redevelopment of the overlay area along the state road 7 sr7 corridor into a quality mixeduse district these provisions offer development intensity bonuses that are specifically intended to promote the assembly of land and to serve as measured incentives to help assure the feasibility of converting the current development pattern along the corridor into modern commercial retail office or residential uses minimum land areas that exceed existing lot sizes are required to ensure that all new development contributes to a growth pattern that attracts highquality tenants a wide range of uses is permitted to encourage the market to create mixeduse buildings and to offer developers the flexibility to meet various market needs design

requirements a building or use must cease to utilize parking on the opposite side of the street to fulfill its parking requirements at the time when a building or use is constructed adjacent to said parking in the event that an onstreet parking space is adjacent to more than one property the property to which the majority of space is adjacent as determined by the community development director shall count however all house uses shall maintain a minimum of one onsite parking space onstreet parking not adjacent to any building or lot may count toward fulfilling the overall parking

stormwater runoff increase groundwater recharge create shade and reduce solar overheating a a cohesive planting theme should emanate throughout the tnd plantings layout and style should not conflict within the tnd b landscaping requirements shall adhere to the requirements of of the land development shade trees are recommended in the planting areas along all streets particularly in the absence of colonnades or awnings that provide shade directly over a sidewalk it is desirable for street trees opposite each other to have their branches grow into each other to create a canopy effect over the street d bufferyards shall not be required adjacent to areas that would offer a natural extension of the tnd or that are compatible with the tnd as determined by the community development director

streets or pedestrian accessways plaza border d seventyfive percent of the border of a square must be defined by streets except lanes square border h lighting the general rule for lighting in a tnd is to prefer a greater amount of smaller lights as opposed to fewer highintensity lights this is in keeping with the overall goal of maintaining the elements of a tnd street in a human scale but also allows for more aesthetic matters such as allowing people to see the night sky 1 height of freestanding lights for this section height includes the pole and fixture a lighting within the interior of parking areas of two or more acres shall not exceed 25 feet in height except along the perimeter where it shall not exceed 12 feet in height b lighting within the interior of parking areas of less than two acres shall not exceed 16 feet in height except along the perimeter where it shall not exceed 12 feet in height c street lights shall not exceed 12 feet in height d lighting in pedestrian and recreational areas shall not exceed ten feet in height e lighting within ballfields and recreational uses shall not exceed 40 feet in height shall be designed to be as inconspicuous as possible and shall not light surrounding uses excluding streets f in cases where the light fixture is placed below the highest point of the pole the pole may extend an additional three feet examples of lighting examples of lighting 2 color of light lighting elements that provide fullspectrum light white light should be used for all street lights so that colors at night are realistic this has the effect of deterring criminal activity and providing people with a better awareness of their surroundings white light sources include incandescent fluorescent mercury vapor and metal halide with metal halide being preferred 3 separation from plantings lighting that is meant to provide visibility for ground locations ie street lights parking lot lights etc should not be placed in a manner that illuminates the top of trees or is blocked by structures 4 decorative lighting lighting that enhances the architectural design of buildings and plantings is encouraged i transportation the tnd shall be built in a manner that encourages the viability of transportation mode alternatives to the automobile the design of the tnd should be of sufficient density and accessibility to encourage pedestrian or bicycle travel within the development and to allow coordinated mass transit nodes for travel outside of the development 1 transit since the highest levels of patronage for transit stations and stops are often found where such transit may be conveniently walked to tnd design should be inherently compatible with transit to properly plan for transit designers should try to have transit access as direct as possible to locations and buildings in the tnd each transit route should also have direct safe secure and pleasant pedestrian and bicycle access planned as a part of each route transit services should go directly into the center of each tnd neighborhood since tnd neighborhood centers typically have shops and services which provide people with a safe and pleasant environment while waiting for the transit to arrive mass transit mode is dependent on the number of persons likely to patronize the mode mass transit may consist of motorized vehicles buses trolleys shuttles light rail or heavy rail it is expected that mass transit will be limited to motorized vehicles within the city of miramars bounds therefore bus shelters and bays must be accommodated in the design of the tnd j income levels

oriented corridor district introduction a transit oriented corridor is generally characterized as a developed environment within a quartermile of a public transit system with building characteristics and public amenities that promote the safe movement of pedestrians the city of miramars future land use designation transit oriented corridor toc is a component of a regional initiative to revitalize the state road 7 corridor and its surrounding communities prior to the establishment of the toc future land use designation the city formed the citizens master plan which was created by the miramarwest park charrette conducted in february 2005 the citizens master plan was prepared by the treasure coast regional planning council the south florida regional planning council city officials and miramar department of community development staff on behalf of miramar stakeholders and residents in addition to the citizens master plan the city relied on the recommendations of the historic miramar study prepared by anthony abbate architect pa in 200 for development of the areas near state road 7 the tocd the goals of previous efforts with elements of the current traditional neighborhood development tnd and state road 7 overlay district standards to produce development standards for the tocd the tocd mixeduse development pedestrianoriented streets public mobility options mediterranean revival style architecture and opportunities for location of work play services and entertainment within walking distance  general this be known as the tocd the city of miramar the tocd promote the goals objectives and policies contained of the toc designation within the future land use element of the comprehensive plan specifically policy 117 and objective 9d of the future land use element are designed to maximize the development potential of state road 7 pembroke road miramar parkway and county line road the tocd the land development ldc provisions within the city of miramar for the area known as the tocd the tocd is generally described as the area bound to the north by pembroke road to the east by state road 7 to the south by county line road and to the west by southwest 66th 61st and 64th avenues to create the miramar envisioned by the citizens during the visioning process the city of miramars tocd modeled after the smartcode the smart released by duany platerzyberk & company and distributed by the nonprofit center for applied transect studies is a formbased land development code that addresses the physical form of buildings and community the opensource smartcode is a transectbased model code intended to be used as a template for adaptation by local governments formbased codes are an alternative to conventional zoning that support the disposition of a community mixeduse development and a sustainable and walkable environment as defined by the formbased formbased codes foster predictable results and a highquality public realm by using physical form rather than separation of uses as the organizing principle for these regulations miramars tocd specifically created to encourage compact firstrate projects based upon smart growth principles  to preserve the existing character of neighborhoods surrounding the state road 7 corridor  to regulate for highquality infill development and to create a predictable process for developers and the community to meet these goals the intent and purpose of the tocd to encourage and promote  public health and safety  mixeduse development  pedestrian mobility  public transit  preservation of neighborhoods

villa a building that occupies the center of its lot with setbacks on all sides this is the least urban of types as the front yard sets it back from the frontage while the side yards weaken the spatial definition of the public thoroughfare space the front yard is intended to be visually continuous with the yards of adjacent buildings the rear yard can be secured for privacy by fences and a well placed backbuilding andor outbuilding b sideyard specific typescharleston singlehouse double house zerolotline house twin a building that occupies one side of the lot with the setback to the other side a shallow frontage setback defines a more urban condition if the adjacent building is similar with a blank side wall the yard can be quite private this type permits systematic climatic orientation in response to the sun or the breeze if a sideyard house abuts a neighboring sideyard house the type is known as a twin or double house energy costs and sometimes noise are reduced by sharing a party wall in this disposition c rearyard specific typestownhouse rowhouse livework unit loft building apartment house mixed use block flex building perimeter block a building that occupies the full frontage leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard this is a very urban type as the continuous facade steadily defines the public thoroughfare the rear elevations may be articulated for functional purposes in its residential form this type is the rowhouse for its commercial form the rear yard can accommodate substantial parking d courtyard specific typespatio house a building that occupies the boundaries of its lot while internally defining one or more private patios this is the most urban of types as it is able to shield the private realm from all sides while strongly defining the public thoroughfare because of its ability to accommodate incompatible activities masking them from all sides it is recommended for workshops loading and schools the high security provided by the

miramar in recognition of the fact that beautiful communities enhance the health safety and welfare of the citizenry and improve the value of the properties within the community this goal can be created only deliberate search for proper design in all elements of the city on the part of the community leadership architects planners realtors and the building industry backed by an appreciation of the visual work by the people public action for improving community appearance as embodied community appearance board will provide the ultimate designers of individual structures within the larger contexts in which their particular works will be viewed since the beauty of a community involves the aesthetic quality of all one sees in moving about it goes far beyond the design of individual architectural facades zoning is the single most powerful legal enforcement of an overall urban concept but it does not fully plan building locations traffic movement or parklands  it does not create beauty aesthetic order or amenity the task of this board is therefore to preserve various elements of urban beauty and require that new projects enhance the existing it is the intent of this board to achieve a pleasant and comprehensible cohesiveness in our community development the method of achieving this goal is by the use of a community design plan the larger contexts referred to above which would indicate for the various parts of the municipality the aesthetic character to be encouraged and the means by which aesthetic character is to be attained and protected the community appearance board is composed of persons with experience in judging three dimensional forms and their interrelationships who have the ability to meet any particular designer on the grounds of his own aesthetic understanding the board acts in review of specific projects to ascertain whether proposals would enhance the community design plan or violate its spirit the enabling legislation for the board defines the objectives and procedures by which the aesthetic intentions are actually embodied in proposed projects and to comply with the architectural design standards described herein the standards must be
