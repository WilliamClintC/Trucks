periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to the lands because they are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood

manner as to minimize future floodblight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 23 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes the following methods are used in this article 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or

from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means 1 substantial physical damage to property  2 damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable  or 3 substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production c a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation d if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the control authority at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible e a user shall submit oral notice to the control authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment requirements within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days from the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the

recreational activities are controlled by governmental regulation the city of seguin supports the texas natural resource conservation commission tnrcc financially quality assessment fees these fees are used for the purpose of monitoring and testing the river water to detect prevent and control any source of pollution or misuse in the river basin the primary function of the city water treatment plant is to provide the public with a safe drinking water supply this responsibility starts with ensuring our source of water is of the best quality possible and to protect our source of supply now and for the future  4296 water quality a in no other industry do so many people depend on so few for so much to guarantee that the public receives the best product and service the texas natural resource conservation commission tnrcc an agency of the state of texas sets and enforces strict guidelines and standards in water treatment processes it requires all plant personnel active in the water treatment to be highly trained and certified b the city water treatment plant has always maintained these standards and has received a superior rating as a water treatment plant in the state of texas c the tnrcc requires annual quarterly monthly and daily testing of water quality to ensure that the water being provided to the consumer meets all water quality standards the majority of the water quality testing is performed in a statecertified laboratory while the daily routine testing is performed by qualified water plant personnel d all plant personnel at the treatment facility are required by the city and tnrcc to be licensed as certified operators this certification is accomplished by attending classes provided by the texas a & m extension service and passing an examination administered by the tnrcc competent trained water plant operators are the key to good water quality  4296 water treatment process a the city operates and maintains a water treatment facility in max starcke park the treatment facility is considered to be a full treatment process which is required by the us environmental protection agency epa and the tnrcc the tnrcc inspects the treatment facility annually to ensure all treatment processes are in accordance with the recommended standards b the water treatment plant pumps water from the guadalupe river to be processed treatment facility as water is pumped from the river a chlorine solution is injected at the discharge of the river pumps for the purpose of prechlorination prechlorination will kill bacteria viruses algae and other waterborne organisms before water enters any treatment unit c after prechlorination the water enters the clarifiers where the processes of flocculation and sedimentation occur to achieve this process a chemical aluminum sulfate is added to the river water which reacts with particulate matter such as silt this reaction is called flocculation flocculation is the formation of curdlike particles of chemical and mud as a result of a chemical reaction the curdlike particles called floc are heavy and will settle to the bottom of the clarifiers thus the process of sedimentation occurs during this process a chemical caustic soda is added to adjust the ph of the water this prevents corrosion of the pipes in the citys distribution system or plumbing fixtures in homes the clear water after the process of sedimentation flows to dual media filters where all remaining silt and organisms are removed after filtration the sparkling clear water is postchlorinated to ensure no bacterial organisms are present which would have been introduced during the treatment process and provide protection throughout the distribution system this water is now safe for human consumption and is pumped to the citizens for their use  4296 water storage and capacity a storage reservoirs and tanks are a necessary part of the city water system during periods of high consumption the storage tanks provide water to meet peak demand use and emergency situations the elevated storage tanks also provide adequate pressure uniformly across the city and allow the treatment plant to be operational at a consistent rate b the city maintains a reservoir which is part of the natural river channel behind the dam in max starcke park the city received authorization to maintain the reservoir in its 1914 water rights permit by the tnrcc the city can impound four hundred twentyfive 425 acrefeet of water 138500000 gallons and divert this water treatment plant for municipal use c the water treatment plant has a rated capacity to purify eleven million six hundred thousand 11600000 gallons per day the water that is purified is stored at the plant in a ground storage tank and clearwells the combined capacity of the clearwell and ground storage at the treatment plant is three million three hundred thousand 3300000 gallons this volume of water is held in storage at the plant to meet peak hour flow demand and emergency events d to meet the immediate needs of the public elevated storage tanks are located throughout the system to maintain pressure and supply as demand dictates the city has four 4 elevated storage tanks in the distribution system a onehalf million 500000 gallon elevated tank is located on east ireland street to meet the needs of the central area of town a one million 1000000 gallon elevated tank is located

divert seven thousand 7000 acrefeet of water per year from the run of the river flow of the guadalupe river for municipal purposes this certification of adjudication has an original priority date of 191 giving the city a senior permit over later permit holders the original 1914 water right permit authorized the city to divert seven thousand 7000 acrefeet of water at a rate of twelve 12 cubic feet per second cfs or five thousand three hundred eighty 5380 gallons per minute gpm in 1988 the diversion rate was increased to twentythree 23 cfs 10316 gpm to meet the projected increase in water use due to population increase the twentythree 23 cfs did not receive the same senior rights dated as the original twelve 12 cfs of  but carries the date it was granted  b these water right have been issued by the texas natural resource conservation commission and are recognized by the state of texas the texas natural resource conservation commission will require the city to comply with all terms conditions and provisions of the permit in turn the tnrcc will protect the citys water rights and the rights to divert water from the guadalupe river by using its branch division the south texas water master to enforce all water rights the city recognizes that its runofriver water right regardless of the priority date will not supply the citys needs during a repeat of the drought of record  4296 alternate water supply a the city recognizes the need of a water supply that will be available at all times even during droughts in order to supply water to its citizens the city of seguin has developed an alternate supply of water in the event the water flow in the guadalupe river becomes insufficient or ceases to meet pumping requirements for the city water system b the city has contracted with the guadalupe blanco river authority gbra for its commitment to supply seguin with stored water from the canyon reservoir the annual commitment from the water from canyon reservoir is for 3000 acrefeet of water this water will be delivered to the city upon request and be diverted from the river channel at a rate not to exceed 23 cfs the water diverted by the water treatment plant is metered to assure all available contracted water is utilized  4296 water conservation plan a introduction the city of seguin is dedicated to conserving one of the worlds greatest natural resources water the city has 13300 acrefeet of available water in its system for residential and industrial use approximately onethird of which is used by the city each year to reduce consumption of water by all customers the city promotes water conservation information water conserving landscaping xeriscape leak detection and repair universal metering rate structure recycling and reuse retrofit programs plumbing codes and implementation and enforcement b education and information water conservation will be promoted by informing water users about ways to save water inside homes and other buildings in landscaping and lawn uses and in recreational uses the city maintains a list of suggested ways that water can be saved daily in the home  bathroom kitchen laundry room appliances and plumbing equipment and outofdoor usage methods of informing the public shall include 1 radio spots a city personnel will provide radio spots on a weekly basis during peak demands these radio spots will keep the citizens up to date on river conditions total water used and encourage citizen support for conservation efforts b conservation tips will be announced on the radio c the city will use a variety of radio spots including ones developed successfully by other agencies d the city will encourage citizen participation by asking them to do radio spots on their best water conservation tips 2 newspaper a provide news releases on the water plant pumpage and storage conditions b provide articles and news releases on water conservation tips 3 pamphlets a pamphlets are available to the public on water conservation in city hall and will be made available at hardware stores and general merchandise stores b when a customer applies for new service conservation tips will be made available for their reference c utility bill messages and door hangers on conservation will be used periodically as appropriate d the city encourages water conservation during community events such as the guadalupe county fair earth day and national drinking water week 4 governmental access cable channel webpage and social media sites a provide daily news releases to keep citizens informed on conservation on the local access cable channel b provide articles on water conservation tips c provide current information on the city of seguin webpage d provide current information and important notices citys social media sites c water conserving landscaping in order to reduce the demands placed on a water system by landscape watering the city will encourage education and information on water conserving landscaping 1 the city encourages landscape architects to use adapted lowwaterusing plants and grasses and efficient irrigation systems in preparing all site and facility plans 2 the city encourages licensed irrigation contractors to use drip irrigation systems when possible and to design irrigation systems with water conservation features such as sprinklers that emit large drops rather than a fine mist and a sprinkler layout that accommodates prevailing wind direction 3 the city encourages commercial establishments to use drip irrigation for landscape watering when possible and to install only ornamental fountains that recycle and sue the minimum amount of water 4 the city encourages nurseries and local businesses to offer adapted lowwaterusing plants and grasses and efficient landscape watering devices such as drip irrigation systems 5 the city will provide waterconserving landscaping at a city facility or park to use as an example for the public d leak detection and repair the city currently has a leakdetection program which is maintained in the following manner 1 the city has invested in an automated meter reading water meter system to be able to monitor water use and to manage the system including the detection of possible leaks 2 if the meter reading is abnormally high a recheck is made to determine if there is a possible leak on the customers service 3 watersewer maintenance department personnel are on call 24hours a day and constantly monitor the water level in all water storage tanks operators can immediately recognize a major water main break when this occurs the water plant personnel notify the watersewer maintenance department so that immediate repairs can begin 4 watersewer maintenance department personnel are on call 24hours a day for repairs if needed when a citizen suspects a water main break by observing water running down the street they are encouraged to call the police department dispatcher so that the oncall personnel can be notified 5 most distribution system leaks are detected early because of the ground condition due to water on the surface and the amr meters e universal metering 1 the city of seguin accounts for water production and water loss by maintaining accurate master meters and a replacement program for distribution meters 2 master meters used to record water plant production purchase of wholesale water and delivery of water to major industrial users are calibrated semiannually the accuracy of these meters is plus or minus two percent accuracy of the manufacturers maximum flow qualified technicians are contracted to check calibration and provide documentation to the city 3 the amr meters that are not working properly or have abnormally high or low readings are replaced the city has in place a meter replacement program 4 the city of seguin meters all customers in their water distribution system meters have been installed on all city and recreational complexes to accurately account for all water used f rate structure the city has a conservationoriented water rate structure which was adopted  this structure has continued present date the citys rate structure encourages the wise use of water this residential rate has been structured to discourage excessive water usage while assuring that the rates will not place an excessive burden on fixedincome residents g recycling and reuse 1 the city of seguin water treatment plant generates wastewater during the treatment process wastewater comes from the backwash process of cleaning filter and sludge removal in clarification units the wastewater from the seguin water plant is stored in sludge basins and is then pumped to the starcke park municipal golf course to irrigate the golf course this reuse water is also pumped to both the city of seguin softball and baseball complexes during a wet season when the golf course and baseball fields do not need to irrigate the wastewater is recycled treatment process of the water plant 2 the city of seguin has two wastewater treatment plants the walnut branch plant has a discharge greater than 2000000 gallons per day a portion of the wastewater effluent is pumped to the rio nogales power plant as reuse water for use in generating electric power the rio nogales power plant also purchases potable water but the wastewater effluent purchase by the power plant reduces the amount of potable water needed by approximately 200000000 gallons annually 3 the discharge from the rio nogales power plant flows to the geronimo creek wastewater treatment plant where the discharge is treated this discharge has a high concentration of minerals and if discharged back to the walnut branch plant it would reduce the amount of effluent capable of being reused by the power plant h retrofit programs 1 the building codes adopted by the city of seguin contain within their guidelines retrofit recommendations that the city building official is enforcing 2 all local plumbing suppliers and hardware stores in seguin stock watersaving devices and encourage their use i plumbing codes the city has adopted the 2009 international residential the 2009 international building the 2009 international energy

art vii by changing the title from emergency water demand management plan to drought contingency and water emergency response plan introduction it is important to distinguish between water demand management planning from water conservation planning while water conservation involves implementing permanent water use efficiency or reuse practices water demand management plans establish temporary methods or techniques designed to be used only as long as an emergency exists an emergency condition can include drought plant or distribution system failure or deterioration of water quality in the water source  52196   7296 objective the objective of the emergency water demand management plan is to provide procedures for voluntary and mandatory actions to be placed into effect to temporarily reduce the demand placed upon the city of seguins water supply system during a water shortage emergency emergency demand procedures not only include conservation but also includes prohibition of certain uses  52196   7296   52014 purpose the purpose of this plan is to provide a means in which to regulate the consumption of potable water in the event that the source water supply becomes
