units footnotes  4  editors note adopted  repealed the former art iv  761776 and enacted a new art iv as set out herein the former art iv pertained to similar subject matter and derived from    e  state law reference condominiums mgla c 183a declaration of emergency pursuant to the authority vested in the city of somerville by of 198 as amended by of 198 and of the acts and resolves of 198 the city of somerville finds and declares that a serious public emergency exists with respect to the housing of a substantial number of the residents of the city of somerville this rental housing emergency has been created by the lack of sufficient new rental housing production by prolonged increases in housing costs at a rate substantially exceeding increases in personal income and by increased costs of new housing construction and finance in addition the critical undersupply of housing in general within the surrounding region further exacerbates the emergency conditions that exist within somerville it has also been created by the effect of conversion of rental housing into condominiums or cooperatives while these forms of home ownership may constitute an important and positive dimension in addressing the housing needs of the city of somerville absent sufficient new rental housing production such conversion necessarily reduces the stock of rental housing otherwise available a substantial and increasing shortage of rental housing especially for the elderly the disabled and persons and families of low and moderate income has been and will continue to be the result of this emergency unless the available stock of rental housing and the tenants who reside therein receive further protection from the consequences of conversion of said accommodations to condominiums and cooperatives than the law now affords this rental housing shortage will generate serious threats to the public health safety and general welfare of the residents of the city particularly the elderly the disabled and persons and families of low and moderate income it is therefore necessary that such emergency be dealt with immediately   title this ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the

convert the building or buildings to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership pursuant to section 764 however the eviction of a tenant for nonpayment of rent or other substantial violation of

converting the building to condominiums if a prior owner transfers property to a prospective purchaser where the owner knows or should have known that the prospective purchaser intends to convert the property to a condominium or cooperative unit and such prior owner seeks to evict the tenant in anticipation of conversion such eviction shall be deemed to be a condominium or cooperative conversion

owners expense to ensure proper operation highhazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately in other situations a compliance date of not more than 14 days after the test date will be established the owner is responsible for spare parts repair tools or a replacement device parallel installation of two

dual check device on a retrofit basis on existing service lines will be instituted at the time and at a potential cost to the homeowner as deemed necessary by the department 2 the owner must be aware that installation of a residential dual check valve results in a potential closed plumbing system within his or her residence as such provisions may have to be made by the owner to provide for thermal expansion devices andor pressure relief valves b strainers the department strongly recommends that all new and retrofit installations of reduced pressure backflow preventers and double check valve assemblies include the installation of strainers located immediately upstream of the backflow device the installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of backflow devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances occurring to the water supply system such as water main repairs water main breaks fires periodic cleaning and flushing of mains etc these occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will cause fouling of backflow devices installed without the benefit of strainers addendum 21491 streets sidewalks and other public places footnotes  1  editors note tables
