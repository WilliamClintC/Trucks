article 7 post construction stormwater runoff control 15701 title this of shall be known as the postconstruction storm water runoff control    121707 15702 purpose and findings a the purpose of this to minimize and prevent the discharge of pollutants from developed land into the surface waters of the city by establishing reasonable requirements for the treatment of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment activities b the governing body finds that land development and the associated increases in impervious cover can increase the quantity and nature of pollutants carried by stormwater runoff increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes aggravate stream channel erosion and sediment transport alter the hydrologic response of watersheds and degrade the ecological function of downstream rivers creeks streams lakes and other water bodies c further the governing body finds that stormwater treatment facilities and requirements can minimize those impacts by reducing pollutant levels carried in stormwater runoff removing or reducing the concentrations of those pollutants that are carried reducing stream bank erosion and by restoring stormwater runoff rates and volumes to levels closer to the predevelopment hydrologic regimes   121707 the city of leawood 15703 abbreviations the following abbreviations when used in these regulations shall have the designated

   121707 15702 purpose and findings a the purpose of this to minimize and prevent the discharge of pollutants from developed land into the surface waters of the city by establishing reasonable requirements for the treatment of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment activities b the governing body finds that land development and the associated increases in impervious cover can increase the quantity and nature of pollutants carried by stormwater runoff increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes aggravate stream channel erosion and sediment transport alter the hydrologic response of watersheds and degrade the ecological function of downstream rivers creeks streams lakes and other water bodies c further the governing body finds that stormwater treatment facilities and requirements can minimize those impacts by reducing pollutant levels carried in stormwater runoff removing or reducing the concentrations of those pollutants that are carried reducing stream bank erosion and by restoring stormwater runoff rates and volumes to levels closer to the predevelopment hydrologic regimes   121707 15703 abbreviations the following abbreviations when used in

district is narrow in scope and offers a very limited range of uses b principal permitted and special uses in district rec no building structure land or premises shall be used and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected constructed reconstructed moved or altered except for one or more of the following principal permitted or special uses 1 public golf courses and accessory driving

maintenance of uses and structures and as otherwise provided in  16282 fl flood hazard overlay district a statutory authorization finding of fact and purposes 1 approval of draft kansas chief engineer prior to adoption the following floodplain management regulations as written were approved in draft form zoning districts leawood development   by the chief engineer of the division of water resources of the kansas department of agriculture on  2 statutory authorization the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12 741 et seq and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the governing body of the city of leawood kansas ordains as follows b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of leawood kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards that consists of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators flood insurance study and illustrative materials of the most recent date as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height zoning districts leawood development   e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in b1  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922 a3  and to meet the requirements of 44cfr 603d and kar 5444 by applying the provisions of this  restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction 3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard d general provisions lands to which this apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city identified as numbered and unnumbered a zones ae ao and ah zones on the index map dated  of the flood insurance rate map firm as amended and any future revisions thereto in all areas covered by this no development shall be permitted except issuance of a floodplain development permit granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restriction as the city council or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in g and 16282i 1 compliance no development located within the special flood hazard areas of this city shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this other applicable regulations 2 abrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this greater restrictions the provision of this prevail all other ordinances inconsistent with this hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only 3 interpretation in their interpretation and application the provisions of this be held to be minimum requirements shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by kansas statutes 4 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes zoning districts leawood development   such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this not imply that areas outside floodway and floodway fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts
