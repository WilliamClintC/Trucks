feet  lam l residential overlay district development guidelines good urban design can help new developments relate to adjacent developments to form strong neighborhoods the land use pattern of a neighborhood plays a major role in determining its strengths and weaknesses most older neighborhoods are linked in the traditional grid street pattern which today is called a neotraditional pattern neotraditional concepts are encouraged in new infill development and in growth areas residential land use should reflect a strong emphasis on the implementation and enforcement of the zoning regulations and subdivision regulations while exploring innovative regulatory approaches in response to private sector development needs the following section contains guidelines based on neotraditional planning principles for new and infill development ord no 563 approved  3125 as amended  197 1 encourage the development of logical interconnected street grids and avoid angled street systems interconnected gridlike street systems allow for a more dispersed traffic pattern because there are multiple routes to move from one place to another within the city a grid configuration of streets helps to minimize peak hour traffic flows in addition these interconnected systems are more comprehensible and thus easier for visitors and residents alike to find their way around the city on the contrary angled street systems with no apparent repetition or order can be disorienting and tend to funnel traffic to collectortype roads even for short distance travel this situation contributes to unnecessarily heavy traffic on main roads at peak traffic periods it should be noted that a grid street pattern does not necessarily require all streets to be straight the design of the roadway system should work with the land the basic goal for the citys overall road layout is a system of northsouth roads that regularly intersect with eastwest roads 2 require the development of treelined streets street trees provide shade for streets and sidewalks improve aesthetics and generally encourage pedestrian use of sidewalks street trees also maintain a ceiling or canopy that further imbues a pedestrian scale to the streetscape 3 require landscaping primarily of mature trees and existing vegetation trees shrubs flowers and other elements of the surrounding environment of a housing area greatly contribute to the quality of life within that area shade wind breaks beautification and attraction of songbirds and other wildlife are all benefits of substantial plant communities within housing areas by far the easiest way to capture these benefits for the residents of a housing area is to preserve the existing vegetation of a site as it is developed rather than relying on newly planted materials to grow and mature slowly recreating an environment which already existed in many cases ord no 563 approved  3125 as amended  198 4 require grass or planting strips between curbs and sidewalks this space provides safety for pedestrians on the sidewalks and creates a visually appealing area 5 encourage a diversity of housing faade styles and colors in new or infill developments repetitive or redundant faade styles within residential developments tend to diminish the visual interest and perception of quality in an area providing several faade styles allows for more individual expression of interest and taste 6 encourage front porches on new houses front porches allow homeowners to comfortably spend more time near the front yard and street this creates a greater opportunity to know ones neighbors maintain a casual surveillance of the area and thereby maintain a safe residential neighborhood this also reinforces a smalltown village ambiance 7 sidewalks should be encouraged on both sides of residential streets one of the most significant elements of smalltown atmosphere and function is that residents can easily walk to other places within the community by placing sidewalks on both sides of streets pedestrian use is indicated as a priority in the community because of a prominent safe and accessible system 8 encourage bikehike paths connecting to existing or proposed trails the development of bikehike trails creates alternative modes of access and transportation for neighborhood children and adults links can provide access to parks community centers and shopping areas while reducing a familys reliance on the automobile 9 promote the creation of deeper lots for more green space deep residential lots allow for more green space within a residential community by providing room for more backyard shade trees landscaping and in instances where existing vegetation is nearby more beneficial wildlife habitat houses should not be allowed to be pulled back off of the streets because of deeper lots as this diminishes the smalltown pedestrian quality of the street environment yard setback requirements should also specify a buildto line 10

allowed in residential areas except privacy fences which prohibit visual access to property and makes casual surveillance by law enforcement and neighbors more difficult visual surveillance is an important part of creating a safe neighborhood environment 12 deemphasize garages extending out from house fronts garages which extend out from the front of a house create an emphasis on the
