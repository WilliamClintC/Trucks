no 116 and to provide for adequate police fire and general governmental services and facilities to serve new residential industrial and commercial development throughout the city the city council finds that the existing police fire and general governmental services and facilities will be inadequate to accommodate the needs generated by projected new residential industrial and commercial growth in the city and that additional services and facilities are needed to protect and promote the health safety and welfare of folsom residents and businesses this finding is based upon data included in august 1993 development impact fee update and the may 1996 supplement prepared by management services institute inc for the city hereafter the nexus studies and on such other information provided to the city council at the public hearing concerning the adoption of this fee b the cumulative and growth inducing environmental impacts of the facilities described in the nexus studies have been identified in the final environmental impact report eir prepared for the 1988 general plan prior to action on sitespecific projects subsequent environmental review will be undertaken as necessary pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa the city council finds that pursuant to of the ceqa guidelines no new effects would occur as a result of this action beyond those identified in the general plan eir and no new mitigation measures are required therefore the city council further finds that adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter is within the scope of the final eir prepared for the citys general plan project and certified by the city council in resolution no 2522 c pursuant to general plan policies 115 116 117 401 403 and similar policies and goals throughout the general plan it is the citys policy to require new development to pay its fair share of the cost to expand public facilities and services that will be necessary to serve residential industrial and commercial development the purpose of this chapter is to implement the requirements of the general plan and under the authority of of the california constitution and the authority of title 7 of the government to establish the appropriate method of ensuring that sufficient funding for police fire and general governmental services and facilities is available to serve residential industrial and commercial growth in the city d the failure to impose the conditions and regulations of this chapter relating to the payment of the capital improvement new construction fee on building permits would jeopardize residents of the community in that it would permit construction and development to proceed without adequate police fire and general governmental services and facilities or adequate means to finance such facilities and services e analysis of the land use expected at buildout of the city pursuant to the general plan makes it possible to estimate the number of dwelling units to be constructed the population generated by those dwelling units and the number of persons to be employed by commercial and industrial land users it is therefore possible to arrive at a fee based on population and jobs created which equitably spreads the cost of police fire and general governmental services and facilities to those who create the need for such facilities and services it is the intent of this chapter to create such a fee spreading the costs of police fire and general governmental services and facilities to those who create the need for such facilities and services without generating any surplus to the general fund f to determine the need for police fire and general governmental services and facilities created by new residents and jobholders and to spread the cost of such facilities among those who create the need for them the city conducted various studies identified herein as the nexus studies the nexus studies estimated the number and type of police fire and general governmental services and facilities to meet the needs created by new development and the cost of such facilities and services the fee established by this chapter shall be calculated in the manner called for in the nexus studies in order that the impact upon facilities and services is borne by the type of development causing the need for such facilities and services g the fee

purpose of this chapter is to further the policies goals and programs of the housing element of the citys general plan and to help facilitate the development of affordable housing within the city the city council finds that the city has become an important component in the economic makeup of the sacramento region and that the expected future expansion of nonresidential development within the city will increase the need for workforce housing the city council further finds that nonresidential development should contribute to the cost associated with providing affordable housing for the citys increased workforce these findings are based upon data included in the  affordable housing trust fund fee technical report prepared by economic & planning systems inc hereinafter nexus study b the city council finds that providing a variety of housing options to workers of all income levels is socially and economically beneficial to the city and its residents in that it would provide opportunities for important professionals such as teachers and public safety personnel to live and work in the city  it would reduce transportation expenses  and would allow a larger share of an employees income to be spent within the community c the city council further finds that the creation and establishment of a housing trust fund as a source of revenue to assist in the development of housing to meet the housing needs of the citys low very low and extremely low income households is consistent with the policies and goals of the housing element of the citys general plan and is necessary for the health and welfare of the citys residents accordingly it is the intent of the city council to establish a housing trust fund which shall be funded by an impact fee imposed on nonresidential development within the city it is further the intent of the city council to utilize the housing trust fund to foster a mix of household incomes in residential projects assisted by the housing trust fund and to disperse affordable housing projects throughout the city to achieve a balance of housing in all neighborhoods and communities d an analysis of land use expected at buildout of the city pursuant to the general plan makes it possible to estimate the undeveloped nonresidential building square footage and the number of persons projected to be employed by such nonresidential development these projections along with a calculation of the required subsidy per dwelling unit and other relevant assumptions were utilized in the nexus study to determine the amount of the housing impact fee it is the intent of this chapter to create a fee in accordance with the nexus study calculations which will spread the cost of providing affordable housing to those who create the need for such housing without generating any surplus to the general fund e the failure to impose the conditions and regulations of this chapter relating to the payment of the housing trust fund fee as a condition of issuance of building permits would jeopardize the general health and welfare of residents and the economic growth of the community in that it would permit nonresidential development to proceed without adequate workforce housing or an adequate means to finance such housing f the housing trust fund is intended to be utilized with other sources of funding including but not limited to fee deferrals fee waivers federal tax credits taxexempt mortgage revenue bonds community development block grants and home funds g the fee established by this chapter is intended to be in addition to

1996 update the studies are on file in the offices of the director and the city clerk 1 1997   part 1991  purpose the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this chapter are as follows a the general plan of the city and in particular the park and recreation element thereof requires that the city be provided in a time frame related to its development with an adequate level of park and recreation facilities so as to maintain not less than 5 acres of developed city parks per 1000 population which is below the existing ratio of park land to population b new development and the expansion of existing development within the city imposes a burden on the existing park and recreation facilities by adding additional population and employees and by creating a need for new park and recreation facilities to serve such development c analysis of the land use expected at buildout of the city pursuant to the general plan makes it possible to estimate the number of dwelling units to be constructed the population generated by those dwelling units and the number of persons to be employed by commercial and industrial land users it is therefore possible to arrive at a fee based on population and jobs created which equitably spreads the burden of park and recreation facilities to those who create the need for them and utilize them it is the intent of this chapter to create such a fee spreading costs of park and recreation facilities to those who create the need for such facilities without generating any surplus to the general fund it is a further purpose of this chapter to implement the general plan by assuring that adequate park and recreation facilities are financed and provided to serve the future needs of the city d the park capital improvement program estimated the cost of park and recreation facilities to serve the entire city is $37609000 of this amount $32555000 is to be funded by the park improvement fee imposed by this chapter the facilities to be funded by the park improvement fee include certain but not necessarily all of the facilities identified in the park improvement program park and recreation facilities to serve areas where the park improvement fee is not imposed shall be financed by other sources of revenue e in order to determine the need for park and recreation facilities created by new residents and jobholders and to spread the cost of such facilities among those who create the need for them the city conducted various studies the studies estimated the number and type of park and recreation facilities to meet the needs created by new development and the cost of such facilities based upon the studies residential development should bear 85 percent of the cost of the facilities and commercialindustrial development should bear 15 percent of such cost the fee established by this chapter has been calculated in the manner called for in the studies in order that the impact upon facilities is borne by the type of development causing the same f the studies indicate that land for park and recreation facilities will be provided by the quimby act dedications and inlieu fees and except as provided in that the fees established by this chapter will be utilized exclusively to provide facilities except in circumstances where the city and the subdivider have entered into a credit andor reimbursement agreement in accordance with the provisions of this chapter credit for subdivider installed park and recreation improvements to the dedicated land shall be allowed against the land dedication andor inlieu fees required by the quimby act and g the fee established by this chapter is in addition to any other fees or charges or taxes required by law or city code as a condition of development including but not limited to the

this chapter is to be collected for park and recreation facilities for which an account shall be established and funds appropriated and for which a proposed construction schedule shall be adopted i the failure to impose the conditions and regulations of this chapter relating to payment of the fee on building permits would jeopardize residents of the community in that it would permit construction and development to proceed without adequate park and recreation facilities or means of financing such facilities j the fee imposed by this chapter is necessary in order to assure compliance with the applicable general plan requirements that new development bear the cost for park and recreation infrastructure which is needed to serve such development k that for a period of greater than 10 days

includes an analysis of the feasibility and financing of 1 continued cityoperated intracommunity bus service  2 continued cityoperated commuter bus service to downtown sacramento andor service to the nearest rt metro rail station  3 extending rt metro service to folsom and the preservation of future rightsofway b based upon the information contained in the transit study the city council finds that existing transportation services will be inadequate to accommodate the needs generated by projected new residential industrial and commercial growth in the city and that additional transit facilities are needed to protect and promote the health safety and welfare of folsom residents and businesses this finding is based on the transit study and on such other information provided to the city council at the public hearing concerning the adoption of this fee c the cumulative and growth inducing environmental impacts of the facilities described in the transit study have been identified in the final

to establish the appropriate method of ensuring that sufficient funding for light rail transportation services is available to serve residential industrial and commercial growth in the city e the failure to impose the conditions and regulations of this chapter relating to payment of the fee on building permits would jeopardize residents of the community in that it would permit construction and development to proceed without adequate light rail transportation service facilities or means of financing such facilities f analysis of the land use expected at buildout of the city pursuant to the general plan makes it possible to estimate the number of dwelling units to be constructed the population generated by those dwelling units and the number of persons to be employed by commercial and industrial land users it is therefore possible to arrive at a fee based on population and jobs created which equitably spreads the burden of financing light rail transportation to those who create the need for such services it is the intent of this chapter to create such a fee spreading costs of light rail transportation service to those who create the need for such facilities without generating any surplus to the general fund it is a further purpose of this chapter to implement the general plan by assuring that adequate light rail transportation service is financed and provided to serve the future needs of the city g in order to determine the need for light rail transit service facilities created by new residents and jobholders and to spread the cost of such facilities among those who create the need for them the city conducted various studies the studies estimated the number and type of light rail transportation service facilities to meet the needs created by new development and the cost of such facilities the fee established by this chapter has been calculated in the manner called for in the studies in order that the impact upon facilities is borne by the type of development

identifying proposed growth within the city limits and further identifying the impacts of such growth upon public facilities within the city including the impacts on water supply and the water supply system b city of folsom general plan urban development policy no 116 policy on municipal services and facilities states in part that it is the policy of the city of folsom to require new development to bear the cost of its increased demandeffect on municipal services and facilities so as to not create a greater burden on existing residents   it is the policy of the city of folsom to require certain necessary improvements as a part of the development andor the payment of municipal services and facilities fees consistent with the proportional effect of the development on such services the city will periodically update its fees to reflect the cost of providing municipal services and facilities c general plan policies 401 402 405 further provide that it is the citys policy to require new development to pay its fair share of the cost to expand public facilities and services that will be necessary to serve residential industrial and commercial development d the city of folsom water master plan dated december 1998 water plan was adopted by the city council on  by resolution no 6028 the water plan analyzed the citys present and projected water supply and facilities demands and the costs of water conservation efforts within developed areas of the city e in order to further determine the need for water supplies and facilities created by new residents and businesses and to spread the cost of such facilities among those who create the need for them the city prepared the water impact fee study dated  this study utilizing information contained in the water plan estimated the amount and type of water supplies and facilities needed to meet the needs created by new development and the cost of such supplies and facilities f existing water supplies will be inadequate to accommodate the needs generated by projected new residential industrial and commercial growth in the city and additional water supplies are needed to protect and promote the health safety and welfare of folsom residents and businesses this finding is based on the water plan the water impact fee study and on such other information provided to the city council at the public hearing concerning the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter the water plan further provides that an additional supplemental water supply is needed to meet demands in dry years when surface water is limited andor unavailable g the city intends to enter into a subcontract with the sacramento county water agency for an additional water supply needed to meet the demands of new residential industrial and commercial growth fazio water the fazio water is part of the central valley project cvp water and has been obtained under public law 101 514  the primary contract and the subcontract further require that the city install water meters throughout the city h specific mitigation measures in the final environmental impact statementenvironmental impact report for the cvp water supply contracts under public law 101514  dated november 1998 cvp feiseir mandate that the city of folsom and the sacramento county water agency shall only execute the subcontract for the fazio water after the city notifies the agency that funding has been provided for the acquisition of alternative dryyear water supplies and for 10 years of water conservation implementation in the form of water meter retrofitting i the city further desires to participate in the regional effort to protect the lower american river which requires that in critically dry years the city limit the amount of surface water obtained from the american river and fill the balance of city needs with alternate water supplies j analysis of the land use expected at buildout of the city pursuant to the general plan makes it possible to estimate the number of dwelling units to be constructed the population generated by those dwelling units and the number of persons to be employed by commercial and industrial land users it is therefore possible to arrive at a fee based on population and jobs created which equitably spreads the burden of financing water supplies and facilities to those who create the need for such facilities it is the intent of this chapter to create such a fee spreading costs of water supplies and facilities to those who create the need for such supplies and facilities without generating any surplus to the general fund the purpose of this chapter is to implement the requirements of the general plan requirements and under the authority of of the california constitution and the authority of title 7 of the government to establish the appropriate method of ensuring that sufficient funding for water supply facilities is available to serve residential industrial and commercial growth in the city k the water impact fee will create a financing mechanism for the acquisition of alternative dryyear water supplies and for 10 years of water conservation implementation in the form of water meter retrofitting thereby allowing the city to fulfill the purposes set forth above in particular the fee established by this chapter is further necessary in order to assure compliance with the applicable general plan requirements that new development bear the cost for water supplies and related facilities which is needed to serve such development l the failure to impose the conditions and regulations of this chapter relating to payment of the fee on building permits would jeopardize residents of the community in that it would permit construction and development to proceed without adequate water supplies and related facilities or means of financing such facilities m the cost estimates set forth in the water impact fee study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the facilities and providing the water supplies specified therein and the fees which may be generated by new development will not exceed the total of these construction costs made necessary by such new development the fee established by this chapter has been calculated in the manner called for in this study in order that the impact upon supplies and facilities is borne by the type of development causing the same n based upon all evidence and testimony presented including the water impact fee study the city council finds that there is a clear and demonstrated relationship between the use of the fee provided for herein namely the acquisition of alternative dryyear water supplies and for 10 years of water conservation implementation in the form of water meter retrofitting and the types of projects upon which the fee is to be imposed namely new residential industrial and commercial development new residential industrial and commercial development will generate a need for additional water supplies and infrastructure as described in the water impact fee study o based upon all evidence and testimony presented including the water impact fee study the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the acquisition of alternative dryyear water supplies and for 10 years of water conservation implementation in the form of water meter retrofitting and the type of development projects upon which the fee is to be imposed namely new residential industrial and commercial construction from careful consideration of the matter the city council finds that 1 new development will adversely impact existing water supplies and facilities  2 will create a need for additional water supplies and related facilities for new development  and 3 the acquisition of water supplies and construction of related facilities set forth in the water impact fee study are appropriate to serve such new development in light of these impacts p based upon all evidence and testimony presented including the water impact fee study the city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee as provided for in this chapter and the cost of the acquisition of alternative dryyear water supplies and for 10 years of water conservation implementation in the form of water meter retrofitting made necessary by new development further the city council finds that the manner in which the fee is allocated upon each unit of new development is fair and does not exceed the cost of providing facilities generated by the construction of each unit of new development q the establishment of this water impact fee is exempt from the california environmental quality act ceqa pursuant to ceqa guidelines b3 and 152 in that there is no possibility that the establishment of this fee may have a significant effect on the environment and further because the purpose of establishing this fee is to assist the city in maintaining services within its jurisdictional boundaries this exemption is specifically based upon the following facts 1 the environmental impacts of the facilities described in the water impact fee study including cumulative and growthinducing impacts have been identified in the final environmental impact report the eir prepared for the 1988 general plan and certified by the city council in resolution no 252 and in the final environmental impact statementenvironmental impact report for the cvp water supply contracts under public law 101514  dated november 1998 and certified by the city council in resolution no 5854 2 the establishment of this fee will not create a need for additional water supplies and infrastructure nor is the construction of water supply facilities entirely dependent upon the establishment of this fee 3 prior to action on sitespecific projects subsequent environmental review will be undertaken as necessary pursuant to the california environmental quality act 4 development already is taking place in the jurisdictional boundaries of the city and additional water supplies will have to be acquired and infrastructure will have to be constructed to accommodate the new population and businesses regardless of whether this fee is established 5 the establishment of this fee does not commit the city to any definite course of action and does not dictate how funds will be spent or in any way narrow the field of options and alternatives available to the city r the city council has considered the effect of the fee imposed by this chapter with respect to the housing needs of the city as a whole and of the region particularly as required by the housing element of the general plan and the city council finds that this chapter does not unduly adversely affect the citys ability to provide for such needs s the fee established by this chapter is in addition to any other fees or charges or taxes required by law or city code or as a condition of development  part 1999  definitions

that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the planning commission for the city of folsom to protect its citizens from flooding the need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built at or below the base flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeal board in passing upon requests for variances the planning commission for the city of folsom shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that material may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding  6 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  7 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  8 safety access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  9 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 10 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges c granting of variance any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure at or below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction at or below the base flood level increases the risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land d records the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variances actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency e conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed at or below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the planning commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the planning commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter 5 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and c determine that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in this chapter  see public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in this chapter of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of e1 e5 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 7 upon consideration of the factors of b and the purposes of this chapter the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary

resource as well as for the maintenance of water quality flood control and groundwater recharge has made wetland and riparian habitat protection and enhancement vital to the general welfare of all residents therefore a wetland and riparian habitat management ordinance must be established for the preservation and enhancement of the citys wetlands and riparian habitats it is necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for these resource areas by discouraging development activities in wetlands and riparian habitat and those activities at adjacent sites that may adversely affect functions and values to encourage restoration and enhancement of wetland and riparian systems and to encourage creation of new wetland and riparian habitat it is the intent of the city to require site planning that avoids or minimizes damage to wetlands and riparian habitat and to require restoration or enhancement of wetlands or creation of new wetlands and riparian habitat to offset losses that are unavoidable in addition it is the intent of the city that activities in affected wetlands and riparian habitat not threaten public safety cause nuisances or destroy or degrade natural wetland functions and values the city requires that site planning and management of wetland and riparian resources meet the following performance standards a increase public awareness of wetland and riparian habitats as an important factor by incorporating wetlands and riparian habitats in the layout and patterning of the development  b increase the preservation and protection of the citys natural beauty
