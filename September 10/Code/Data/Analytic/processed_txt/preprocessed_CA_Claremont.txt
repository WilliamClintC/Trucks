to clients while allowing fortunetellers to provide their services to clients with only minimal restrictions c the sections of this chapter will make it more difficult for an unscrupulous fortuneteller to commit fraud or larceny but will not affect the nature of the information conveyed by the fortuneteller or the manner in which it is conveyed these sections require only minimal expense and effort on the part of the fortuneteller and will not therefore impose any undue burden on the fortunetellers practices d fortunetelling for entertainment purposes does not create the same risk of fraud and larceny by an unscrupulous practitioner as would the practice with an individual client because it is done with a group at a public place for the purpose of entertaining and not to deal with the private concerns of an individual 1407  fortunetellingdefinition fortunetelling means the telling of fortunes forecasting the future or furnishing any information not otherwise

to ever increasing demands  2 the continuation of californias economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses  3 it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource  4 landscapes are essential to the quality of life in california by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water preventing erosion offering fire protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development  5 landscape design installation maintenance and management can and should be water efficient  and 6 of the california constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use of water b the city hereby finds that 1 the city of claremont has established a water conservation ordinance that prohibits wasteful uses of water throughout the city by all water users  2 the wholesale water purveyor and regional water import agency have developed an allocationbased and tiered water rate structure that requires the local retail water provider to document water use for all water meters in the city  3 incentivebased water use efficiency programs have been actively implemented within claremont for many years  4 current local design practices in new landscapes typically achieve the state model water efficient landscape use goals  5 all water services within the city are metered  6 landscape plan submittal and review has been a long standing practice in claremont  7 the average rainfall in claremont is approximately 173 inches per year and the annual reference evapotranspiration rate annual eto is 513  and 8 the local water purveyor has implemented a tieredrate billing structure and enforcement of water waste prohibitions for all existing properties throughout its service area which includes the city of claremont in its entirety c consistent with these findings the purpose of the citys water efficient landscape to establish an alternative local ordinance that is acceptable under ab 1881 as being at least as effective as the state model water efficient landscape the context of conditions in the city in order to 1 promote the values and benefits of landscapes while recognizing the need to invest water and other resources as efficiently as possible  2 establish a set of procedures for planning designing installing and maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects  3 establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes  and 4 use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount note authority
