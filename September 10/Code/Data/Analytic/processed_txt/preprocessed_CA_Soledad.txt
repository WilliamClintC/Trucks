incompatible pollutants to publicly owned treatment works are required to adopt best practicable control technology currently available as defined by the administrator pursuant to b of the act where the citys treatment works was designed to and does achieve substantial removal of pollutants other than the four pollutants listed in the definition for compatible pollutants in f of the act bod suspended solids ph and fecal coliform bacteria  the city may at its discretion not require the user to achieve best practicable control technology currently available since this would lead to an uneconomical duplication of treatment facilities while the term substantial removal is not subject to precise definition it generally contemplates removals in the order of eighty percent or greater minor incidental removals in the order of ten to thirty percent are not considered substantial for some industrial categories it may be necessary to define pretreatment guidelines for problems that may arise as a result of the discharges into the citys treatment works however any adjustments required for particular industrial categories should be considered in connection with the citys requirements rather than in the national pretreatment standard limitations on wastewater strength in subsections a and b of this section may be supplemented with more stringent limitations pursuant to a if the city determines that the limitations in subsections a and b of this section may not be sufficient to protect the operation of the citys treatment works  or b if the city determines that the

install meters the charges and fees may be based upon an estimate of the volume to be discharged prepared by the city a rational method will be used to estimate the quantity of wastewater discharged and may consider such factors as the number of fixtures seating capacity population equivalent annual production of goods and services or such other determinations of water use necessary to estimate the wastewater volume discharged b for users who in the opinion of the city divert a significant portion of their flow from a community sewer the charges and fees may be based upon an estimate of the flow and volume to be discharged prepared by the user and approved by the city provided the user obtains a wastewater discharge permit and pays the applicable charges and fees the estimate must include the method and calculations used to determine the wastewater volume and may consider such factors as the number of fixtures seating capacity population equivalents annual production of goods

set forth below in individual sections is necessary to serve the public interest by reducing the risk to life andor property of the citizens of soledad because of the following conditions a the city is located in a seismically active area the city is in close proximity to the san andreas fault the longest and potentially most devastating earthquake fault in the state of california the san andreas fault is considered to be potentially dangerous to areas which lie within 50 to 100 miles of its trace and lies a mere 134 miles to the northeast of soledad although no active faults are located within the soledad planning area the loosely consolidated nature of underlying soils is likely to result in severe ground shaking and possible ground failure during strong earthquakes such factors also contribute to concerns regarding slope instability in the foothills and mountains surrounding the city seismic concerns require modification to the code provisions to ensure public safety and the integrity of existing and new structures b portions of the city are subject to flooding from the salinas river and major storm water flows from the northeast hillside area of the city during the 1990s the city incurred damage from flooding on two separate occasions after heavy rainfall flooding and drainage concerns require modifications to the code provisions to ensure public safety and prevent or minimize potential property damage from floodwaters c the city is subject to fire hazards the abundance of natural grasses east of the city limits west of the railroad tracks and along the salinas river basin when paired with the strong prevailing winds common to this region of monterey county presents a special risk to fire hazards these hazards require modifications to the code provisions to ensure public safety and prevent or minimize fire risks to property within the city additionally although not required by regional variations certain adjustments to the administrative provisions of

individual units the citys financing is almost always secured by a deed of trust recorded subordinate to financing from other institutions often the owners wish to refinance the senior institutional financing to obtain a lower interest rate while keeping the citys loan in place in such cases the new lender requires the city to subordinate its deed of trust to the new financing so the new financing retains priority in the event of default b generally the city will approve subordination requests when 1 the borrower is refinancing solely for the purpose of obtaining a lower interest rate  2 the borrower is taking no cash out of the transaction  3 the new institutional loan is fully amortized with no balloon payment  and 4 the subordination does not place the city loan at greater risk c generally the city will not approve subordination requests when 1 the senior institutional financing is deferred or only partially amortized and the borrower proposes to take cash out of the transaction  2 the new institutional financing may result in negative amortization unless the city is satisfied that there is adequate owner equity at least twenty to twentyfive percent and excellent credit history  3 the subordination places the city loan at significantly greater risk  4 the borrower is not in full compliance with the citys affordability requirements  or 5 the refinancing exceeds the value of affordability as determined by the calculation of value and resale price  part 2005   calculation of value and resale price the affordable units must remain affordable to very low low or
