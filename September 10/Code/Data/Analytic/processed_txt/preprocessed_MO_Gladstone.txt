support structures purpose the general purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement construction and modification of telecommunications towers support structures and antennae in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the public while at the same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace within the corporate boundaries of gladstone specifically this chapter is intended to 1 provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facilities and systems to serve the citizens and businesses of the city of gladstone  2 minimize adverse visual impacts of communications antennae and support structures use of careful design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  3 maximize the use of existing and new support structures so as to minimize the need to construct new or additional facilities  4 maximize the colocation of facilities on any new support structures and facilitate the fewest and least visible new structures capable of achieving these objectives  5 ensure that any new telecommunications tower or structure is located in an area compatible with the neighborhood or surrounding community to the extent possible  6 ensuring that regulation of telecommunications towers and structures does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service  1262009 general requirements the requirements set forth in this

from    adopted  cross reference utilities   et seq  zoning and planning title vii article 1  statutory authorization findings of fact and purposes statutory authorization the state of missouri has authorized cities of third class to enact ordinances they deem expedient to preserve the peace and good order and to protect the health of inhabitants in accordance with rsmo  floodplain management is deemed necessary in this regard therefore the city council ordains as follows in this chapter  7272015 findings of fact a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of gladstone missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for clay county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood  7272015 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in section a  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d by applying the provisions of this chapter to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard  7272015 article 2  general provisions lands to which chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of gladstone missouri identified as numbered and

by this chapter f exceptions the provisions of this chapter shall not apply to notices posted by order of any court or to notices to the public required by law to be posted in public places g legislative purpose and intent the city council makes the following findings of legislative purposes and intent 1 that the expression of political speech is an important and constitutionally protected right 2 that under certain circumstances it may be necessary to restrict or regulate the time place and manner of the expression of such speech in order to advance and protect other significant legitimate interests of local government 3 that political signs have certain characteristics that distinguish them from many of the other types of signs permitted and regulated by the city these characteristics include the fact that many of such signs intended to be temporary in nature do not meet the regular structural and installation requirements necessary to prevent them from being affected by weather and other natural forces and presenting a potential hazard to persons and property severe weather conditions including without limitation thunderstorms with accompanying high winds tornados ice accumulation and flooding are characteristic of local weather conditions with respect to the temporary nature of such signs the durational and illumination regulations provide a channel of communication on an election candidate or issue balancing the aesthetic and public health and safety concerns surrounding temporary structures 4 that the primary purpose of political signs placed along a roadway is to attract the attention of drivers and distract them from their primary responsibility of constant attention to traffic and road conditions this concern is especially acute in residential areas where young children present a significant potential hazard for drivers with respect to residential areas with their lower speed limits it is concluded that political signs not exceeding 26 inches 660 mm by 26 inches 660 mm on each side with no more than an aggregate sign surface area of 64 square feet 595 m 2  per lot is adequate to convey most political messages although it is recognized that certain individuals may wish to express political thoughts that require a larger area to adequately convey them a greater number of or larger and more complex messages would further distract drivers attention presenting an unacceptable safety risk and there exists in the community adequate other means for conveying such message in nonresidential areas motorists frequently see and reasonably expect to see larger signs so their attention is not as easily distracted and higher speed limits larger lot areas and a larger size sign can be allowed consistent with safety requirements further since permitted signage in residential areas is minimal the aesthetic impact of signs in residential areas is much greater than in nonresidential areas 5 that in addition to the safety and traffic interests affected by political signs the city council concludes that the unrestricted proliferation of political signs would create visual clutter have an adverse effect on the aesthetic quality of the city with accompanying adverse economic effects and detract from the desirable visual environment that the city has made a strong effort to create land use regulations 6 that the city council concludes that the interests to be protected by this regulation are sufficiently substantial to justify the contentneutral regulation of political speech represented by this section and that this section represents a reasonable accommodation of the citys interest with first amendment rights  2142005 offpremises advertising a rules and regulations notwithstanding the provisions of
