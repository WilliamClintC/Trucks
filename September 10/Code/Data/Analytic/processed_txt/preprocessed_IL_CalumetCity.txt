site development requirements of this chapter contains the land development requirements that manage the runoff of stormwater that leaves the development site it includes criteria for the amount of water that can leave a site and measures that must be taken to improve the quality of the water 3 floodplain development requirements of this chapter contains requirements for developments that will be located in the floodplain it includes criteria to protect the new development to minimize the impact of the development on flooding to other properties and to protect the flood conveyance channel 4 overlapping requirements a floodplains are part of the watershed all floodplain developments must also meet the site development requirements of article ii where applicable b the definitions in section 3434 and the administrative procedures in sections 3435 and 3436 apply to both articles ii and iii 5 development this chapter regulates all development as defined in section 3434 definitions a
