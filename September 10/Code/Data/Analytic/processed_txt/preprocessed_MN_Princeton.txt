county wisconsin  and adams county colorado  have conducted studies of the impact of adult establishments on their respective communities these studies have concluded that adult establishments have an adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhoods those impacts include increased crime rates lower property values increased transiency neighborhood blight and potential health risks the city council of the city of princeton is relying on such studies recognizing that the same or similar adverse impacts could occur in a small city such as princeton the findings are based upon the experiences of

adverse impact that adult establishments have on the surrounding area diminishes as the distance between populated areas and public gathering places and the adult city of princeton title 6 nuisances and offenses 649 establishments increases j a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult establishment a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to require that the adult establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexuallyoriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein k the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexuallyrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this l the barring of individuals with sexuallyrelated criminal convictions from the management of adult establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which may lead to the transmission of sexuallytransmitted diseases m the general health safety and welfare of the community is promoted by prohibiting

forth the methods and policies relating to local improvements and special assessments practiced in the city of princeton it is emphasized that the following summarization is general in nature and that certain circumstances may justify deviations from stated policy as determined by the city council a local improvement involves one or more of the following types of improvements 1 roadway grading and base 2 bituminous surfacing 3 curb and gutter 4 sidewalks and driveways 5 water trunks and laterals 6 sanitary sewer trunks and laterals 7 service connections 8 storm sewer trunks and laterals 9 all appropriate appurtenances associated with the above improvements are classified as follows 1 new developments  the construction of improvements related to newly developed areas normally made in conjunction with the plat approval process 2 rehabilitation  complete or partial reconstruction of the above mentioned improvements including bituminous overlays rehabilitation does not include routine maintenance which does not improve the structural integrity of a roadway such as sealcoating and crack sealing procedures for public improvements city of princeton 705 2nd street north subdivision mn 55371 rev 1094 7633892040 xi2 3 extensions  construction of improvements generally made to extend services to a certain area extensions normally pertain to water sanitary sewer and storm sewer trunks the following are general principles policies and procedures applicable to all types of improvement 1 project costs shall include the cost of all necessary construction work required to accomplish the improvement plus engineering legal financing and contingent costs 2 assessable costs are project costs minus the city share county share andor other credits 3 special assessments will be levied as soon as practical normally this will be within one year after completion of the project 4 pursuant to ms the city does not defer assessments to benefited areas outside of the city but rather assumes any nonassessable cost as the city share when property is annexed and served by the original improvement the city can create a new assessment to be reimbursed for all or any portion of the prior assumed municipal costs including interest related to the improvement 5 publicly owned properties including municipal building sites schools parks state and federal building sites but not including public streets and alleys are regarded as being assessable on the same basis as if such property were privately owned project initiation and hearing process this section intends to describe the initiation of improvement projects and the administration required to final county action pursuant to the requirements of msa 429 a project initiation 1 by petition petitions for initiating improvements will be prepared by city staff upon request such petitions circulated by the affected owners should bear the signatures of the property owners of at least 35% of the benefited property petitions may be requested and submitted at any time the normal time required for receiving processing scheduling hearing and preparing construction documents is six months projects for petitions received after february 1 will not be scheduled until the construction season of the following year 2 by council action if the council determines that an improvement is in the best interest of the city it can without petition initiate the improvement procedures for public improvements city of princeton 705 2nd street north subdivision mn 55371 rev 1094 7633892040 xi3 3 by 100% signed petition when a petition is signed by 100% of the property owners benefited by the improvement and there is no city cost participation the council may order the improvement without holding an improvement hearing 4 by developers agreement improvement projects for new development will be considered upon execution of a developers agreement signed by 100% of the benefited property owners the council may order the project without a public hearing b hearing process 1 improvement hearing after a petition is filed and its adequacy determined or the council initiates the project the city engineer is directed to study and report as to the feasibility of the improvement if after reviewing the report the council feels the project has merit a public hearing is scheduled notice published twice and all persons benefited by the project notified in writing when an improvement project is to be financed by the sale of improvement bonds there is a statutory requirement that at least 20% of the total costs of the project be assessed against the benefited property if after the improvement hearing at which all persons are heard the council feels that the project still has merit then the council will authorize the preparation of necessary plans and specifications and upon receipt and acceptance of those plans will authorize by resolution the advertisement for bids c final hearing assessment after the improvement is ordered and plans received or the improvement is completed or nearing completion a roll will be prepared and the affected property owners will be mailed a notice of assessment hearing stating the time and date that an assessment hearing will be held an assessment roll will be prepared and will be posted at the city administrators office for review prior to the assessment hearing all interested parties shall have an opportunity to be heard regarding the assessment necessary and proper adjustment to the assessment roll can be made by council at the time the hearing is being held if an appeal is to be made regarding the amount of the special assessment written notice must be filed with the council prior to or at the assessment hearing after the hearing the assessment roll is adopted by the council the property owners have a 30day period in which to pay their assessment in part or in full at the city hall interest free after this period the

at the time of land platting whether city installed or developer installed improvements see appendix for sample the developers agreement normally references means and methods of providing for public improvement construction as a standard the city of princeton has pursued policies by which all costs of the improvement are directly attributed to and fully paid by cost allocation or assessments against the development developer or properties requiring and benefiting by the improvement the policies are established with the intent that no developmental costs are incurred by existing lots or parcels by the existing residents or by the city in general the exception is for improvements which are determined to have an areawide benefit which exceeds the scope of the development at the time of platting the cost responsibilities for any development for trunk improvements shall be defined this responsibility includes trunk sanitary sewer facilities trunk water facilities including source supply storage and distribution components storm water drainage and control facilities arterial street park dedication pedestrian walkway systems and other public improvements existing or proposed of

specific council action for each development proposal based on perception by the council of the project viability and development benefit to the city the city may elect to sell bonds for such improvement and assess the costs of bond retirement against individual benefited land parcels for a period of repayment as seen appropriate typically the total project costs for improvements benefiting the development will be assessed on an equal basis against all buildable lots in the development for such city assessed developments and improvements the city development agreement requires a 25% down payment a bond or letter of credit to protect the city from potential project default and requires assessment payment concurrent with building permit issuance for such city assisted projects the city engineer provides design construction supervision and assessment certification services and other city staff provides legal fiscal and administrative input c public improvement work

as it is benefited by each separate improvement all property within district boundaries is to be included as determined by the city engineer in general all property will be assessed except lots or areas which are not able to be developed area shall include square footage within property lines excluding public road easements natural waterways swamps or other wetlands designated by the dnr 2 units generally used for sewer and water services in residential developments may be used for sewer and water laterals in existing residential developments the number of potential units possible by subdividing based on minimum lot requirements if the street in which sanitary sewer or water lines are to be installed is to be improved all services will be installed to service the maximum number of potential lots 3 adjusted front footage generally used for all improvements except for the above method for determining adjusted front footage see exhibit a the following formulas will be used to determine adjusted front footage a odd shaped or pie shaped area of the lot up to a maximum depth of 150 divided by 150 eg 15000 square foot lot on a culdesac   15000 divided by 150   100 adjusted b approximate rectangular lot  average of the front and back lot line method of assessment city of princeton 705 2nd street north subdivision mn 55371 rev 1094 7633892040 xii2 c rectangular lot  actual front footage d shallow lot less than 150  area of lot divided by 150 e corner lot  same as rectangular lot except credit against long side equal to 75% of the short side credit will be assessed against short side and lots adjacent to short side to the midpoint of the block f double frontage for double frontage lots 150 or less in depth a single adjusted front footage is computed by using method 1 2 3 or 4 if more than 150 in depth the area within the first 150 of depth abutting the primary access is divided by 150 to arrive at the first adjusted front footage the balance of the lot is then sued in computing the second frontage by using method 1 2 3 or 4 if the second frontage abuts a major arterial street where restricted access is desired by the city an exemption for the first 150 of such second frontage may be granted upon receipt by the city of a formal access restriction executed by the property owner such formal access restriction shall be in the form of a deed for planter easement running to the city of princeton with a minimum width of 10 see example 6 on  g neck for lots or parcels which have a small frontage on a street with a narrow strip running back 130 or more an adjusted frontage of 100 feet is assigned see example 7 on  h areas partially served by utilities  for any tract or parcel only partially served by water or sewer lateral only that part so served will be assessed and computed as adjusted front footage for the particular project for which the assessment is figured a parcel or lot may be wholly served even though the improvement may not run entirely past see examples 4 and 5 on  b typical method of assessment 1 streets  adjusted front footage 2 curb and gutter  adjusted front footage method of assessment city of princeton 705 2nd street

assessed for water and sanitary sewer laterals all other property more distant than 150 from the street rightofway may be subject to connection charges or future assessments all water and sewer lines regardless of size or designation are considered as laterals to adjacent property and will be assessed if they provide service to the adjacent property a corner lot which has a water or sewer line on its side line from which the lot may be served but not in front of the lot shall be assessed for the improvement based on lot frontage 4 sidewalk adjusted front footage method is used 5 street

when it is developed and is connected to the water andor sewer utilities this deferred charge or assessment will be levied as a connection charge and may be paid in cash or may be spread on the assessment rolls by submission of waivers of hearing from affected property owners these connection charges deferred assessments are computed by dividing the areas of the property subject to assessment by 150 and multiplying by 50% of the average assessment rate over the most recent five years records are kept and when assessments are processed strips of property 150 deep are recorded as levied future street construction in the area so designated would be subject to assessment for utilities but would receive full credit without interest for assessments previously paid assessments for any property lying within 150 of an existing street which has utilities installed but which has not bee previously assessed for utility construction will be calculated on the most recent assessment rate for the type of construction made this assessment will be spread or connection charge paid upon connection to the utility system 8 storm sewer the city engineer shall determine the drainage area to be served by the new storm sewer construction the square feet subject to assessment and the runoff factor contributed by each parcel the project cost is then divided by the sum of the runoff factor to establish the cost per square foot property will be assessed its square feet times the cost per square foot times the runoff factor the council reserves the right to adjust the assessment for certain properties depending on the circumstances without invalidating the above described method 9 method of payment interest on the assessments will begin accruing from the date of the adoption of the assessment roll the owner may pay the entire amount of assessment within 30 days of adoption of the assessment roll without interest otherwise the assessment shall be paid in equal annual installments typically 10 years plus interest as determined by the council typically 1% above the net interest rate of the bond issue annual payments will be remitted with the property taxes an owner
