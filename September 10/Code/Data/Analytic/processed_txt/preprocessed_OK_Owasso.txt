development pud is a special zoning overlay that provides alternatives to conventional land development upon approval it becomes a supplement to the existing zoning of the subject property a pud is also a means of encouraging creative development of land and promotes project design that is often unseen in conventional development a pud shall not be seen as a tool to circumvent the owasso zoning owasso subdivision regulations but rather as a tool for intelligent wellplanned and quality developments that fit within owassos existing neighborhoods and the context of the surrounding area a pud provides flexibility to allow for development on properties with unique physical characteristics by promoting innovative design and providing guidelines which ensure that development is beneficial to the city of owassos future growth while great flexibility is given to provide special restrictions which will allow development not otherwise permitted procedures are established herein to ensure against misuse of the increased flexibility  goals because a planned unit development pud allows greater flexibly than otherwise would be allowed with the base zoning there are specific goals that need to be accomplished with each application all puds shall be evaluated on their ability to accomplish the following a maintain and enhance the quality of life in owasso  b provide opportunities for urban infill  c maintain and promote a sense of community  d encourage development that otherwise could not occur on the site  e preserve and provide meaningful open space  f promote connectivity and compatibility with surrounding development  g inspire unique and thoughtful development  h support the development of strong neighborhoods  i provide amenities beyond conventional development  and j preserve the physical characteristics of the land  applicability a planned unit development pud may be submitted for any parcel of land located within any general zoning district or combination of zoning districts within owasso city limits in all cases the pud will be reviewed as to the proposed location and character of the uses and the unified treatment of the development of the tract the regulations of the general zoning district or districts remain applicable except as specifically modified pursuant to the provisions of this of a conceptual development plan is required prior to

density any proposed development that contains over twentyfive 25 units per acre shall provide an explanation of why the higher density would be appropriate and how the additional density would be mitigated amenities setbacks or other treatment all multifamily residential developments shall be accomplished pud  land use percentages in any residential planned unit development pud at least twenty 20 percent of the gross area of the tract shall be devoted to open space common areas or amenities rightsofway and utility easements on individual lots shall not apply to open space calculations if at least twenty 20 percent open space cannot be achieved the project may be required to provide additional amenities in order to mitigate the reduction in open space because all pud projects are unique the community development director or their designee shall determine if additional amenities are required in relation to the amount of open space provided 43  preservation of trees and other natural features planned unit developments puds shall be designed to preserve and enhance the existing physical characteristics of the land and its natural vegetation projects that require clear cutting or

can provide substantial justification to remove said trees tree preservation credits shall be applied to all landscaping plans if found to meet the requirements of this additional landscaping shall be required for projects that remove excessive healthy vegetation  screening and buffering screening is an important part of any planned unit development pud proposal especially when incompatible uses are proposed within the pud or exist in adjoining developments screening may be employed in the form of a fencing wood fencing shall have metal posts placed on the inside b walls stone brick splitfaced block or similar decorative materials shall be used c berms berms may be used in combination with vegetation or fencing to achieve the desired result d vegetation vegetation provides a

a minimum of twenty 20 feet in width vegetation and screening is required in buffer yards all residential pud shall contain decorative fencing along adjacent arterial roadways and shall also contain language covering the longterm maintenance of the fencing if wood fencing is to be used decorative columns of rock brick split face block or similar permanent material shall be used at regular intervals  transition of uses great care shall be given as to the location of the more intense uses or densities within the planned unit development pud transition should be achieved when possible by placing less intense uses along the perimeter of the pud area with more intense uses near the center of the pud for example if a pud is proposed in an area that abuts mostly acreage lots the pud should place larger lots meeting re or rs1 standards along the perimeter and move towards smaller lots within the core of the pud area or along arterial streets if transition cannot be achieved a large and wellvegetated buffer should be provided 44  conceptual landscape plan each planned unit development pud shall require a conceptual landscape plan at the time of submittal the conceptual

possible need for additional freeboard or protection from velocity induced erosion 26 k vertical alignmentlongitudinal slope in many cases the grade of the side ditch will follow the profile grade of the roadway these template ditches are generally constrained not only in profile grade but also in alignment and cross section by the geometric and safety standards applicable to the project in addition maximum and minimum allowable velocities will define the upper and lower bounds of the longitudinal slope for special ditches whose slope differs from that of the profile grade the engineer
