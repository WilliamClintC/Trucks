certified backflow inspector an individual that has completed the special training and demonstration of competency in the installation and testing of backflow prevention devices by the state of tennessee and attends and completes current criteria set forth by the state of tennessee for renewal of hisher current certification in installation and testing of backflow prevention devices 4 crossconnection any physical connection whereby the public water supply is connected with any other water supply system whether public or private either inside or outside of any building or buildings in such manner that a flow of water into the public water supply is possible either manipulation of valves or because of any other arrangements 5 crossconnection control administrator the individual designated in the town of jonesborough to direct and oversee the rules and regulations of 1see title 13 in this code for provisions relating to the administration of the water and sewer systems 822 jonesboroughs crossconnection program and be responsible for the enforcement and compliance with said program 6 double check  detection assembly dcda a specially designed unit that includes a line size approved double check valve with a specific bypass line equipped with a small water meter and a threefourths inch 34 double check valve assembly this assembly is designed for unmetered fire lines and the meter will detect small leakage or theft of water fire line 7 degree of hazard means an evaluation of the potential risk to public health and the adverse effect of the hazard upon the potable water system 8 health hazard an actual or potential threat of contamination of a physical or toxic nature to the public potable water system 9 interconnection any system of piping or other arrangement whereby the public water supply is connected directly with a piping system such as but not limited to sewer drain conduit pool storage reservoir auxiliary intake or other device which does or may contain sewage or other waste or liquid which would be capable of imparting contamination to the public water supply 10 nontoxic not poisonous  a substance that will not cause illness or discomfort if consumed 11 parallel devices two 2 devices side by side with approved plumbing to keep water from being shut off during repair or replacement  this is used where water service cannot be discontinued 12 person any and all persons including any individual firm or association and any municipal or private corporation organized or existing under the laws of this or any other state or country 13 post indicator valve piv the piv is a control valve whereby the fire department or maintenance personal can quickly turn off the sprinklers in cases where the building is inaccessible it gives the sprinkler company fire department or maintenance personnel a means to turn off the system without having to contact the water department the post indicator portion is an above ground device bolted on top of the sprinkler control valve the control nut wrench and indicator are visible from the street the purpose of the design is that the mechanism can be found quickly and because it shows open or closed at a glance the state of the system is known instantly 14 public water system the waterworks system furnishing water to the town of jonesborough for general use and which supply is recognized as a public water supply by the tennessee department of environment and conservation 15 reduced pressure rp or reduced pressure zone rpz this type devise is used for high hazard crossconnections it is comprised of two 2 separate check valves with a zone between the two 2 check valves the zone and relief valve assembly in a rpz device acts as both a fail indicator and a pressure vacuum breaker of sorts a check valve when working 823 correctly allows water to travel one 1 way only toward the customer and that is all however when the first check valve fails on a rpz device something different happens simply put if it is failing it cannot hold against backpressure or backflow so another way of saying that is when the first check valve fails the pressure between the zone or customers side of the check valve and the inlet or city side of the first check valve equalizes this causes the relief valve within the zone which is comprised of a spring that is pushing with a force of 2psi to open the relief valve spilling water out of the bottom of the unit when it reaches the ranges of 2psi it starts to open when the differential reaches 0psi the relief valve will be fully open this not only causes quick action by the owners of an establishment to expedite repairs in addition it will cause the pressure to drop within the zone area even further exponentially which is in a sense selfregulating because the pressure on the customers side of the first check valve or zone is then always going to be lower than the pressure on the city side of the first check valve or inlet simply put it makes it less likely backflow can occur until repairs are undertaken finally the second check valve merely acts as a redundant backup for the first check valve it is the first line of defense against backflow from the customer side however it does not have the abilities that the aforementioned accompanying relief valve offers 16 reduced pressure detector assembly rpda an assembly composed of a linesize approved pressure principle backflow prevention unit with a bypass containing a water meter and a reduced principle backflow prevention assembly the meter registers accurately at very low rates of flow and the unit is used to protect against high health hazard such as antifreeze or chemical suppression foam from fire vehicles that may be drawn or siphoned back into the water system

conversion occurs once the upland drainage area to the pond has been stabilized the sequence of construction shall include notes on when these activities are to take place the use of earth bermsdikes swales sediment traps outlet structures and sediment basins are strongly encouraged over the use of silt fence and straw bales for long term projects and where concentrated runoff is present all disturbed areas that will not be disturbed again within fourteen 14 days shall be temporarily or permanently stabilized with seed mulch andor other appropriate measures within fourteen 14 days of grading or clearing operations ceasing it is very important that disturbed soil be stabilized as soon as possible to prevent sediment runoff for slopes  or steeper they must be 1112 temporarily or permanently stabilized within seven 7 days of grading ceasing on those slopes 15 a stone construction exit per the tennessee sediment control handbook shall be provided for all construction ingressegress points for all construction projects including single lot construction this is required in order to prevent mud sediment and debris on jonesborough streets and public ways at a level acceptable to the public works director or building inspector mud sediment and debris brought onto streets and public ways must be removed by the end of the day by machine broom or shovel to the satisfaction of the public works director failure to remove said sediment mud or debris shall be deemed a violation of this chapter it is the contractors responsibility to prevent sediment from leaving the construction site and this includes sediment leaving the site by way of runoff flowing out the entrance or by vehicular tires carrying the sediment into the street if there is runoff flowing down the construction exit to the street a mountable stone berm or equivalent measures shall be used to direct the runoff to sediment control devices adjacent to the exit the use of smaller stone or gravel other than shown in the tennessee sediment control handbook is not permitted 16 proposed structures  location to the extent possible and identification of any proposed additional

approved standards the stormwater plan shall contain measures that will ensure development construction or site work will meet or exceed the following standards 1 the development fits within the topography and soil conditions in a manner that allows stormwater and erosion and sediment control measures to be implemented in a manner satisfactory to the jonesborough planning commission development shall be accomplished so as to minimize adverse effects upon the natural or existing topography and soil conditions and to minimize the potential for erosion 2 plans for development and construction shall seek to minimize cut and fill operations construction and development plans calling for excessive cutting and filling shall be justified to the jonesborough planning commission 1113 3 during development and construction adequate protective measures shall be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills fills shall not encroach upon natural water courses their flood plains  or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other properties 4 preconstruction vegetation ground cover shall not be removed destroyed or disturbed prior to obtaining a grading permit perimeter sediment controls shall be in place prior to the start of clearing or grading operations 5 developers shall be responsible upon completion of land disturbing activities to leave slopes and developed or graded areas so that they will not erode such methods include but are not limited to revegetation mulching riprapping or gunniting and retaining walls bank cuts and fills should preferably be  slopes or flatter  however they shall not exceed a  slope without planning commission approval and must be permanently stabilized regardless of the method used the objective is to leave the site as erosion and maintenance free as is practical 6 provisions are implemented that accommodate any increased in stormwater runoff generated by the development in a manner in which the predevelopment levels of runoff for the two and tenyear storm events are not increased during and following development and construction the board of mayor and aldermen reserves the right to require stormwater management to maintain predevelopment levels of runoff for the 25 50 100year storm event when it is determined that it is in the best interest of the town to consider partnering with the developer to further reduce stormwater flows onto adjoining properties or if a known flooding problem exists downstream any stormwater detention or retention pond shall also be designed to pass the 100year storm peak attenuation to the 100year predevelopment rate is not required pond without over topping any portion of the dam this can be accomplished principal spillway and emergency spillway which shall be installed on virgin soil and not to be placed on fill material or the dam if it is not feasible to place the emergency spillway on virgin soil then the principal spillway shall be designed for the 100year storm to the extent necessary sediment in runoff water must be trapped by the use of sediment basins silt traps or other sediment control measures until the disturbed area is stabilized structural controls shall be designed and maintained as required to prevent pollution the town strongly encourages the use of sediment trapsbasins and earth bermsdikes for sediment control measures silt fence may be used but should not always be the first or only device considered all off site surface water flowing toward the construction or development area shall to the extent possible be diverted around the disturbed area by using berms channels or other measures as necessary limiting the amount of runoff especially concentrated runoff from flowing construction site can be extremely helpful in preventing or significantly reducing sediment 1114 runoff under no circumstances unless a drainage easement is obtained may be diverted off site runoff be redirected onto off site properties or be diverted onto an off site propertys existing drainage way in a manner that would cause harm to the property 7 all grading

the town of jonesborough wishes to minimize the negative effects of development on our environment on our economy and on our health while at the same time reducing development costs for the developers and maintenance costs for the town and the developer all efforts should be utilized to implement site design and nonstructural stormwater management practices 1117 to reduce and minimize runoff in new development efforts to enhance infiltration passage or movement of water into the soil surface reduction of hard surfaces minimizing the concentration of runoff and lengthening of the time of concentration should be a priority the following bmps and stormwater credits can be applied to the peak and water quality stormwater calculations thereby reducing the size and cost of the stormwater bmps a natural area conservation the preservation of forest wetlands pasture land and other sensitive areas of existing vegetation thereby retaining predevelopment hydrologic and water quality characteristics if these areas are undisturbed and placed in a recorded protective easement these areas may be subtracted from the total site area when calculating water quality volume the post development curve numbers for these areas can be modeled as forest in good condition b disconnection of rooftop runoff rooftop runoff that is disconnected from another impervious surface and directed over a pervious area will infiltrate into the soil or be filtered by the surface material the longer the flow path of the water from the pipe across vegetated areas the greater the filtering and infiltration of the runoff which in turn improves water quality and reduces downstream runoff if the lot is graded to disperse the rooftop runoff as sheet flow least fifty feet 50 of thick grass or other thick vegetation or least twentyfive feet 25 of existing woodlands fifty percent 50% of the rooftop impervious area draining vegetation may be modeled as grass in good condition when calculating the post development curve number if reforestation or planted landscape beds equal in area to fifty percent 50% of the rooftop area is placed in the path of the disconnected rooftop runoff then the remaining fifty percent 50% of the rooftop impervious area may be modeled as grass in good condition when calculating the post development curve number if the rooftop runoff is discharged into a properly designed and constructed bioretention facilityrain garden onsite one hundred percent 100% of the rooftop impervious area draining to the device may be modeled as grass in good condition when calculating the post development curve number in addition under both conditions listed above the total impervious area in the water quality calculations may be reduced relative to the impervious area reduction associated with the curve number credit if downspouts need to be piped away from building foundations to prevent damage to the foundations the pipes must outfall at least ten feet 10 preferable further from any property line if the downspouts are piped and the runoff cannot disperse in accordance with the above requirements no stormwater credit is available 1118 c disconnection of nonrooftop impervious runoff rooftop runoff that is disconnected from another impervious surface and directed over a pervious area will infiltrate into the soil or be filtered by the surface material the longer the flow path of the water across vegetated areas the greater the filtering and infiltration of the runoff which in turn improves water quality and reduces downstream runoff discharging runoff from impervious surfaces onto pervious surfaces use of pervious pavers permeable paving surfaces rain gardensbioretention facilities grassed swales use of open road sections in lieu of curbed roads and by grading the site so that runoff travels from an impervious surface to a pervious surface before being collected in a drainage system all of these increase filtering and infiltration of stormwater before the flows become concentrated and this in turn improves water quality and reduces downstream runoff which means pipes swales ditches and stormwater facilities can be smaller avoid sending runoff from one impervious surface directly onto another impervious surface place pervious surfaces between impervious surfaces along the runoff path if the site is graded to disperse the impervious runoff as sheet flow least fifty feet 50 of thick grass or other thick vegetation or least twentyfive feet 25 of existing woodlands fifty percent 50% of the impervious area draining vegetation may be modeled as grass in good condition when calculating the post development curve number if the impervious runoff is discharged into a properly designed and constructed bioretention facilityrain garden onsite one hundred percent 100% of the impervious area draining to the device may be modeled as grass in good condition when calculating the post development curve number d sheet flow maintain sheet flow for as long as possible before the runoff has to be collected in a stormwater conveyance system sheet flow increases infiltration and lengthens the time of concentration which in turn improves water quality and reduces runoff downstream spread out concentrated flows created by the development before they are discharged offsite using stilling basins level spreaders directing runoff or other means so the runoff returns to predevelopment characteristics to meet the adequacy of outfall provision of this chapter and to improve water quality and reduce runoff downstream e

at minimum the landscape plan shall indicate 1 the size location number and type of species involved in proposed frontage landscaped areas landscape islands within parking lots and screening and buffers the jonesborough urban forester or qualified staff shall when possible undertake a field review of the site plan area and mark specimen trees that should be preserved when possible because of one of the following a the tree represents a quality specimen of its species and would require numerous years to duplicate  b the tree represents a hardtofind native species  c the location of the tree provides a natural buffer from adjoining properties or facilities contractors or developers are expected to explore ways to preserve these designated trees and provide reasonable justification

measures or the performance base equivalents shall apply 1 species intended for preservation on the landscape plan shall be clearly marked with protective fencing or some other approved barrier that is placed at the designated distance on the approved site plan or a distance approved by the urban forester or qualified staff prior to the initiation of excavation species designed for preservation should be protected prior to the beginning of grading or the establishment of building pads or paved areas 2 no soil should be placed around trees that are intolerant of fill and are to be saved dogwoods birches oaks and sugar maples and most conifers are for example intolerant to fill because their roots are often near the surface 3 stockpiling of soil resulting from grading shall be located only in open areas no material or temporary soil deposits shall be placed within four feet 4 of shrubs or ten feet 10 of trees designated for preservation 4 no soil shall be disturbed in a ten foot 10 radius or if greater within the drip line of the trees to be preserved 5 barriers used to protect existing plantings shall be selfsupporting ie not supported by the plants they are protecting a

specimen trees and existing plantings to encourage for the preservation of a specimen tree or significant wooded area setback requirements along side and rear property lines may upon review and approval by the board of zoning appeals be reduced by as much as twentyfive percent 25% also the number and size of required parking spaces may if approved by the planning commission be modified to encourage the preservation of existing plantings jan 8 197  78 as amended by oct 8 197  3 and replaced by #200115 dec 200 and #200909 sept 2009 11609 general landscape design standards 1 general size specifications at the time of planting all required trees shall have a minimum trunk diameter of at least two inches 2 as measured at six inches 6 above the ground and shall be nursery grown all required trees shall have a minimum height of six feet 6 when planted all required shrubs used for buffering shall have a minimum height of two feet 2 when planted and shall be capable of reaching a minimum height of three feet 3 within three 3 years of planting all shrubbery shall be nursery grown 2 tree types tree type may vary depending on overall effect desired however where ten 10 or more new trees are required a mixture of more than one 1 species shall be provided to create a natural look and guard against the possibility of disease obliterating all required trees as a rule trees should be indigenous relatively fast growing not particularly susceptible to insects and disease longliving and require little care a list of acceptable tree species is maintained by the urban forester or other staff and trees not found on the list may be credited as a required tree provided that the tree and townscape board is provided with justification for the species from a developer or the urban forester or qualified staff and the board approves the species submitted 3 general spacing standards proper spacing distances depend on the tree type its growing habits and whether freestanding specimens or an interlaced canopy is desired as a general rule unless a canopied effect is desired eg for buffering a good guide is to space trees so as to exceed the farthest extent of branch development at maturity required shade trees shall generally have a minimum horizontal separation from other required trees of eight feet 8 in all cases required trees whether new or existing shall be spaced so that they will not interfere with utilities obstruct vision clearance or obscure streetlights jan 8 197 art 8 as replaced by #200115 dec 200 and #200909 sept 2009 11114 11610 prohibited plantings 1 utility considerations as noted in other sections of this chapter consideration shall always be given to the placement and type of plantings particularly trees involved in a landscape design so that such plantings will not interfere with utilities specifically it shall be unlawful for any person to plant the following a within any recorded sewer or water easement any species prone to clogging water or sewer lines with roots including but not limited to poplar box elder silver maple american elm catalpa siberian elm cotton wood black walnut and weeping willow b within any recorded easement for overhead electric or telephone lines any species known to reach a mature height greater than twenty feet 20 2 vision clearance considerations all species shall be located so that they provide for vision clearance vision clearance shall be evaluated on both the existing physical characteristics of a species and its anticipated physical dimensions at maturity as added by jan 13 198 and replaced by #200115 dec 200 and #200909 sept 2009 11611 buffering 1 intent buffer yard requirements are designed to provide physical separation and visual screening between adjacent land uses that are not fully compatible such as duplexes and service stations buffering is also necessary to create privacy soften glare filter noise and modify climatic conditions 2 applicability buffer yards are required where development of a new higher impact use resulting from either a new use of a vacant lot change in ownership or tenancy abuts an existing lower impact use impact use classifications are discussed in the subsequent  11612 entitled classification of buffer areas in cases where the use classification is uncertain the planning commission shall make a decision based on the specific situation character of the use and the surrounding andor proposed plan of development for example the use of publicowned buildings which is permitted in all zoning districts will have very different impacts on abutting properties depending on the nature of the use as a result buffering for these kinds of uses shall be evaluated on the basis of the most similar private sector use and the uses prevalent in the surrounding neighborhood the jonesborough regional planning commission and the jonesborough board of mayor and aldermen may increase buffer yard requirements where it has approval authority 3 appeals whenever class 3 buffers are required if at the time of site plan review it is determined that the required buffer cannot reasonably be expected to provide visual screening within five 5 years of installation the jonesborough regional planning commission in conjunction with the building inspector may require a different type of buffer than those specified below if 11115 applicant disagrees with the findings heshe may appeal those findings to the board of mayor and aldermen 4 impact classification n no impact 1 any use unless otherwise listed below which is permitted in r1 or r1a zoning district  2 cemeteries  3 golf courses  4 parks and similar uses l low impact 1 any use unless otherwise listed below which is permitted in r2 r3 r4 b1 zoning districts  2 community and neighborhood recreational facilities and similar uses m medium impact 1 any use unless otherwise listed below which is permitted in the b3 and b4 zoning districts  2 gasoline service stations  3 convenience stores  4 parking garages  5 auto repair garages and similar uses  and 6 miniwarehouses h high impact 1 any use only permitted in the m1 or m2 zoning districts  and 2 any proposed development which would create more than 500 parking spaces proposed use classification adjoining use classification no impact n low impact l medium impact m high impact h no impact none 1 2 3 low impact none none 1 2 medium impact none none none 1 high impact none none none none example a new apartment complex a low impact use located in an r3 zoning district will abut an existing single family residential a no impact use area the developers of the apartment complex the high impact use will be responsible for creating and arranging for the maintenance of a class 1 buffer however if this apartment complex were to abut any equal or lower impact use the developers of the complex would not be responsible for creating any new buffer area 5 planting schedule plantings approved in the landscape plan in buffer or setback areas along residential or commercial lots adjoining properties not in the development area must be planted prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the structure constructed in developments involving multiple structures or phased construction the required buffering must be planted within or adjoining individual lots before the structure constructed is occupied 11116 the building inspector has the authority to issue a temporary certificate of occupancy on a lot by lot basis if buffer planting could truly not have been undertaken because of weather or some other legitimate restriction or roadblock in such case the developer or owner must sign an agreement stating the date the buffer planting will be completed failure to meet the agreement deadline will constitute a violation of the chapter with each day being considered a separate violation as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200909 sept 2009 11612 classification of buffer areas class 1 a class 1 buffer area is designed for those abutting uses which are only mildly incompatible for example an apartment complex abutting a duplex as a result the buffer requirements associated with the class 1 buffer are minimal one of the following three options would be created as an acceptable minimum buffer option a1 one 1 row of evergreen trees spaced no greater than eight feet 8 on center species which may require different spacing standards may be approved provided adequate documentation is submitted to justify a variation option b1 one 1 row of evergreen trees with a minimum width spaced no greater than twelve feet 12 on center and a minimum of four 4 shrubs provided per tree 11117 option c1 a solid barrier brick or masonry wall or wooden fence or equivalent at least six feet 6 in height where a landscaped berm is used and would be periodically mowed for maintenance purposes no slope shall exceed twentyfive percent 25% berms planted with ground cover and shrubs may be steeper  however no slope shall exceed fifty percent 50% class 2 class 2 buffer areas are designed to provide greater shielding than is provided in the class 1 class 2 buffers are for incompatible uses which because of noise lighting smell etc require larger buffers for example a proposed commercial use abutting an existing singlefamily neighborhood would require a class 2 buffer the class 2 buffering requirements could be met by completing at a minimum one of the following options option a2 a minimum buffer strip width of twelve feet 12 with a row of trees no greater than twelve feet 12 on center and with no less than six 6 shrubs per tree 11118 option b2 a minimum buffer strip width of twelve feet 12 a minimum six foot 6 high fence specifically approved by the planning commission with a row of trees not greater than twelve feet 12 on center and with no less than two 2 shrubs per tree option c2 a minimum buffer strip of twelve feet 12 with a double row of buffer trees with a minimum row separation of eight feet 8 planted a maximum of twelve feet 12 on center class 3 the class 3 buffer is designed for abutting uses which are completely incompatible for example a development which will have a high level of noise light traffic industry large development abutting a low density residential neighborhood would be required to construct a class 3 buffer along the abutting property lines at minimum class 3 buffer requirements could be met by adhering to one of the following options option a3 a buffer strip with a minimum width of twentyfive feet 25 and with no less than three 3 rows of buffer trees with a minimum row separation of eight feet 8 and spaced no more than sixteen feet 16 on center 11119 option b3 a minimum six foot 6 high fence specifically approved by the planning commission with two 2 rows of tree with row separation or no more than eight feet 8 and space no less than twelve feet 12 on center the buffer strip shall be a minimum of twenty feet 20 as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200909 sept 2009 11613 protective screening 1 applicability excluding the development of individual singlefamily or twofamily detached dwelling units protective screening shall be provided in all zones 2 screening requirements a protective screen in the form of a masonry wall wood fence or opaque landscaping to prevent public view from any street rightofway excluding alleys or adjoining property shall be provided for the following a dumpsters 11120 b all mechanical equipment which is larger than five feet 5 by five 5 by four feet 4 high shall be screened mechanical units smaller than this shall not require screening if they are located to the side or rear of the building and are not visible from a collector arterial or freeway as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200909 sept 2009 11614 parking lot landscaping 1 intent the purpose of landscaping within and around parking areas is to a enhance a developments property value and business opportunities by making it more inviting to customers or visitors b provide shade for comfort when walking and after returning to the parked vehicle as well as to reduce heat build up produced by asphalt surfaces on hot days and to buffer winter winds c muffle noise in and around the development and the parking area d filter the air by absorbing exhaust gases and giving off pure oxygen e protect water quality by modifying the rate of erosion storm water runoff into natural and manmade drainage areas f break up the mass of pavement associated with parking lots which will provide sense of human scale slow traffic lot and provide safe pedestrian routes from the building to the automobile g minimize the hazard of nighttime headlight glare for drivers and pedestrians 2 applicability parking lot landscaping shall be required for all uses which involve the creation of more than twenty 20 off street parking spaces either as a new use or by expansion where parking spaces are not paved and striped parking lot landscaping shall be provided as required by this section for uses which designate more than four thousand 4000 square feet of the site for parking purposes interior landscaping shall not be required for parking garages or other enclosed parking structures such use however shall be buffered as required 3 planting requirements where parking lot landscaping is required one 1 shade tree or two 2 ornamental trees and at least two 2 shrubs per required tree shall be planted for every ten 10 parking spaces or in the case of existing parking lots which are enlarged every additional ten 10 spaces unmarked lots shall have one 1 shade tree or two 2 ornamental trees and at least two 2 shrubs per required tree for every two thousand 2000 square feet of area designated or used on a daily basis for parking 4 standards for trees used specifically in parking lot landscaping any trees used for parking lot landscaping shall meet all of the following minimum requirements 11121 a shall have a clear trunk of at least six foot 6 above finished grade to provide for maximum vision clearance b shall be able to thrive in existing soil and should be tolerant of excessive heat deicing salt and the oils and other chemicals often found in additional volume in parking lot environments c shall be species with strong wood which is not prone to breakage in wind or ice storms d shall be fruitless or otherwise free of parts that fall and could damage vehicles clog drains or make pavement slippery e shall not interfere with either above or below ground utilities f shall have pavement cut outs of sufficient size for tree survival and growth approved by a professional landscaper when landscaping is placed in a previously developed and paved portion of a site 5 spacing requirements trees required for parking lot landscaping may be clustered however in no case shall any individual parking space be greater than seventyfive feet 75 from the trunk of a required parking lot tree and no more than one hundred twentyfive feet 125 from two 2 or more required parking lot trees distances shall be measured in a straight line from the dbh to the nearest portion of the individual parking space parking lot landscaping shall not extend more than fifteen feet 15 beyond any area designated or commonly used for parking furthermore in no case shall parking lot landscaping be counted toward fulfilling any other landscaping eg buffering requirements of this chapter 6 interior planting islands  dimensions where interior planting islands are used to meet the requirements of this section each island shall be no less than three feet 3 wide at its greatest point in any dimension each planting island shall be bordered by a minimum six inch 6 concrete raised curb or wheelstop to prevent damage to required landscaping where a tree is located within a planting island there shall be provided at least sixty 60 square feet of pervious land area for each tree within the island required trees shall be planted so that the base of the tree as measured six inches 6 above the ground shall be at least three and onehalf feet 3 12 behind the curb or traffic barrier to prevent damage to the tree by auto bumpers where an island is parallel to parking spaces the island shall be at least nine feet 9 wide to allow ample radius for car doors to swing open 7 interior planting islands and parking space dimensions where parking spaces abut planting islands the required length of parking spaces may be reduced by up to two feet 2 also general parking space dimensions may be reduced and an area designated for compact vehicles established within this area parking spaces for ninety degree 90 angle parking may be reduced to no smaller than seven and onehalf feet by fifteen feet 7 12x15 in order to free up space needed to meet any of the parking lot landscaping requirements of this 11122 chapter in all cases any modifications to parking space dimensions shall be specifically approved by the planning commission as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200909 sept 2009 11615 frontage landscape areas 1 intent in addition to parking lot landscaping and buffering requirements plantings shall also be provided along the public road frontage for those applicable situations noted below in order to a better define parking areas b shield views of parked cars to passing motorists and pedestrians c create a pleasing harmonious appearance along the roadway d promote individual property values and pleasing community atmosphere 2 applicability any new family multifamily commercial or industrial development which will front along the same public street for at least fifty 50 linear feet shall be required to plant frontage landscaping along that frontage frontage landscaping shall also be required where an existing lot of record is used by an existing multifamily commercial or industrial entity and is combined with adjacent property to create at least fifty feet 50 of additional public road frontage in which case frontage landscaping shall be required along that additional frontage 3 requirements landscaping along any public road frontage shall be within a strip which is at least ten feet 10 wide this strip shall include at least one 1 shade tree or evergreen tree or two 2 ornamental trees for each fifty 50 linear feet of public street frontage required trees may be clustered or spaced in any manner desirable to the developer and owner provided such spacing does not interfere with utility line locations in vision clearance between required trees additional landscaping in the form of shrubs berms masonry walls or other landscaping or combinations of landscaping acceptable to the planning commission shall be provided this landscaping shall be at least three feet 3 in height or in the case of plantings capable of reaching three feet 3 in height within three 3 years and shall be spaced so that no nonlandscaped gaps excluding driveways and sight line exist which are greater than six 6 linear feet plantings other than trees shall be at least eighteen inches 18 high when planted a gap greater than six 6 linear feet may be permitted by the planning commission where a clear safety concern is demonstrated or a more natural look would otherwise be conveyed as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200909 sept 2009 11616 completion bond in order to ensure the acceptable completion of required landscaping the building inspector may withhold a certificate of occupancy until required plantings are installed per the approved landscape plans if a certificate of occupancy is desired and it is not an appropriate time 11123 of year for planting a completion bond irrevocable letter of credit or similar security measure shall be provided by the developer to the town of jonesborough if landscaping is not planted according to the approved landscape plan the town shall retain the right to cash the bond or security measure after providing written notification to the developer in order to complete the landscaping as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200909 sept 2009 11617 maintenance required landscaping plantings that are a requirement of this landscape ordinance shall be maintained on an ongoing basis such plantings that are required or those that are preserved must be removed and replaced with plant species meeting the landscape ordinance requirements if such plantings are not living within one 1 year after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or the release of a performance or completion bond the jonesborough tree and townscape board may determine that a required landscape planting with tree losses needs to be addressed and may notify the code enforcement officer andor building inspector of the need to evaluate compliance concerns and possibly issue a notice of corrective action and appropriate timetable persons found not to be meeting this maintenance requirement are in violation of this chapter and subject to fine each day of violation shall be considered a separate offense enforcement shall be the responsibility of the code enforcement officer or the building inspector the planning commission reserves the right to require a maintenancereplacement bond in an amount up to one hundred ten percent 110% of the projected cost of the landscaping in an approved landscape plan for a period up to two 2 years in those situations in which the experience with a developer has been such that there is doubt about the commitment of the developer to meet the maintenance requirements of this chapter and a bond is needed to provide the necessary protection as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200909 sept 2009 11618 continued maintenance requirements property owners shall remain responsible for maintaining in a healthy and orderly manner required plantings approved in a landscape plan specifically this shall mean that 1 all plant growth in landscaped areas be controlled by pruning trimming or other suitable methods so that plant materials do not interfere with public utilities restrict pedestrian or vehicular access or otherwise constitute a traffic or pedestrian hazard 2 all planted areas shall be maintained in a relatively weedfree condition and clear of undergrowth 3 all trees shrubs ground covers and other plant materials shall be replaced if they die or become unhealthy because of accidents drainage problems disease or other causes 11124 also where manmade materials are used alongside landscaping such materials shall be maintained in good repair including where applicable periodic painting or finishing subsequent building permits may be withheld if after written notification landscaping either required or preserved is not properly maintained as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200204 march 200 #200513 june 200 and #200909 sept 2009 11619 application procedures

than ten 10 business days before the regular meeting date in order to be on the commissions agenda the tree and townscape board shall review all landscape plans prior to action by the commission and submit comments recommendations questions and concerns a minimum of five 5 days before the regular meeting date of the commission the planning commission will render an acceptance denial or conditional acceptance when plans are approved subject to certain conditions such conditions may be satisfied by working with the building inspector or other such enforcement officer designated by the board of mayor and aldermen provided such conditions are classified as minor as described in the following  11620 entitled minor changes to approved or conditionally approved plans as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200513 june 200 and #200909 sept 2009 11620 minor changes to approved or conditionally approved plans minor changes made to approved landscaped plans shall be first approved by the building inspector before any such changes may be made to these original plans where such proposed changes would clearly compromise the intent and purpose of this chapter such changes shall be deemed as major and shall be presented to the jonesborough regional planning commission for a decision as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200909 sept 2009 11621 application procedures  expansions of andor alterations to existing developments when a use of a property is expanded or changed so as to require landscaping the applicable provisions of the previous  11617 entitled maintenance required and  11618 entitled continued maintenance requirements shall apply so that the town of jonesborough is provided with a security that the landscaping will be installed and maintained as required in this chapter where required landscaping can only be provided in existing paved areas pavement cutout shall be of sufficient size to ensure the survival of the species adequate space shall be provided to permit air and water to the root system in general the site should be prepared by digging or rototilling an area twelve inches 12 deep and typically five times the

commission where such work is not initiated the plans shall be resubmitted to the planning commission for approval of the proposed landscaping as added by #200115 dec 200 and replaced by #200513 june 200 and #200909 sept 2009 11623 alternative methods of compliance in cases where a strict interpretation of the requirements of this chapter may by reason of topographical conditions practical difficulties or undue hardship the developer may appear before the planning commission to present an alternative method of compliance in all cases such alternative means of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall only be permitted by the planning commission if they remain true to the intent of the landscape ordinance the jonesborough regional planning commission would evaluate the petitioners request for alternative compliance based upon whether one or more of the following conditions clearly would apply 1 the development has obvious space limitations or is on an unusually shaped parcel 2 topography soil vegetation or other site conditions are such that full compliance is impossible impractical or unnecessary 3 due to a change of use of an existing site the required buffer yard is larger than can be provided 4 obvious safety considerations are involved 5 an alternative plan as demonstrated by a landscape specialist would clearly improve the environmental quality traffic safety and the overall aesthetics of the town to an extent much greater than would be possible by adhering to the provisions of this chapter in all cases if an alternate means of compliance is permitted such compliance shall approximate the requirements of this chapter to the greatest extent possible as added by #200909 sept 2009 11624 conflict if the provisions of this chapter conflict with other ordinances or regulations the more stringent limitation or requirement shall govern or prevail to the extent of the conflict as added by #200909 sept 2009 11625 severability if any section

1 where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director of environmental services may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with section 22e and 22f 2 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director of environmental services may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 3 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director of environmental services shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with tennessee rule 1200414065 4 a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section a categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the town of jonesborough upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of subsection 2 of this section are met b criteria i either a the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or b the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters ii credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate 1327 additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere iii credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section iv credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the wwf discharges the town of jonesborough may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result 5 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the town convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the des the town may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in sections 22e1a e1e below a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must i employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  ii currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  iii provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effiuent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  iv not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and v have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for
