971 title this chapter shall be known as the middlesex township impact fee program  972 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish the middlesex township impact fee program including a transportation capital improvements plan to ensure that the transportation system is available and adequate to support existing volumes of traffic and traffic projected to be generated by new growth and development to advance this objective the middlesex township impact fee program shall be based upon the imposition of an impact fee payable to the township at the time of building permit issuance additionally the program identifies existing deficiencies due to pass future trip generation attributable to new development the program will provide a continuing generation of funds necessary for the township to initiate and complete capital transportation improvements as needed in support of new growth and development such a program will involve participation by developers as well as local state and federal governments through the impact fee program the township is establishing a process whereby future traffic needs can be addressed in a timely manner and the impact of increased traffic volumes can be minimized to the extent possible  973 findings the board of supervisors hereby finds and declares that 48editors note see 53 ps  10101 et seq  8925 impact fees  973   974 definitions as

at service levels necessary to support residential and nonresidential growth and development b transportation service levels will be provided by the township utilizing funds allocated via the capital budget capital improvements programs and impact fees c the aggregation of development in the defined transportation service areas intensifies the demand for transportation improvements designed to accommodate traffic volumes at a d level of service for township intersections and a c level of service for township road segments as defined by the transportation research board of the national academy of science which is the minimum acceptable level of service to accommodate such development and the intensity thereof d the development potential of properties in the defined transportation service areas is reflected in the roadway sufficiency analysis adopted by resolution no 0432 and the townships comprehensive plan and is implemented via subdivision and land development and zoning e to the extent that new development in the transportation service areas places demands upon the transportation system those demands should be satisfied by the establishment of an impact fee program that distributes the responsibility for financing the provision of such transportation facilities among the township state and federal governments and developers f the amount of the impact fee to be imposed shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the municipalities planning ps  10501a et seq as amended and this chapter applying the engineering standards set forth in trip

14010  article i general provisions  1441 short title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the middlesex township stormwater management   1442 statement of findings the governing body of middlesex township finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of middlesex township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues f federal and state regulations require certain townships to implement a program of stormwater controls these townships are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  1441 solid waste and recycling  1442   1443 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and welfare within middlesex township butler county by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in  1442 of this chapter intended to  1444 statutory authority g nonstormwater discharges to township separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth a meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa to protect maintain reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the commonwealth b manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems c preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible d maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources e maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses f preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams and prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds g manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source with a minimum of structures and a maximum use of natural processes h provide procedures performance standards and design criteria for stormwater planning and management i provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and permanent stormwater management facilities and best management practices bmps that are constructed
