under investigation is operating at normal routine conditions and as necessary at other conditions including but not limited to design maximum and fluctuating rates c general requirements all tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures 1 the noise control officer shall to the extent practicable identify and document all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement prior to taking any noise measurements the noise control officer shall explore as is reasonable under the circumstances the vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that could affect measurements to establish the approximate location and character of the principal sound source and to select suitable locations from which to measure the sound from the source in question 2 except as otherwise provided in this measurements shall be taken at or near the nearest real property boundary of the property receiving the alleged offending sound 3 the noise control officer shall conduct an external calibration of the sound level meter using an acoustic calibrator immediately before and after a series of measurements at each test site the noise control officer shall also conduct a calibration check at least once every hour during the measurement period to ensure continuing accuracy of the meter 4 unless the sound level meters manufacturer specifications allow adjustments to be made to compensate for the following factors no outdoor measurements shall be taken a during periods when the wind speed including gusts exceeds 15 miles per hour  b without a windscreen recommended by the meters manufacturer properly attached to the meter  c under any condition that would cause the meter to become wet such as rain snow fog or condensation  or d when the ambient temperature is out of the meters range of tolerance 5 no measurement may be taken on private property without the permission of the owner or the owners representative or in the absence thereof without a search warrant or court order 6 during measurement the meter and microphone must be taken from a distance of at least three feet above the ground or from any reflective

trafficcontrol devices  appendix a zoning article i  general provisions intent and purpose a regulation of the location size placement and certain features of signs is necessary to enable the public to locate goods services and facilities in the city without difficulty and confusion to encourage the general attractiveness of the community and to protect property values therein accordingly this chapter is enacted to establish regulations governing the display of signs which will 1 promote and protect the public health safety comfort morals and convenience  2 promote aesthetics in the city  3 protect the environment  4 enhance the economy and the business and industry of the city by promoting the reasonable orderly and effective display of signs and thereby encourage increased communication with the public  5 restrict signs and lights which overload the publics capacity to receive information or which increase the probability of traffic congestion and accidents by distracting attention or obstructing vision  6 reduce conflict among signs and lights and between public and private information systems  and 7 promote signs which are compatible with their surroundings are appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain and are expressive of identity of proprietors and other persons displaying signs b as these or any regulations can only establish the mechanical limits of signage and not enforce a level of visual quality in sign design anyone planning a sign is strongly encouraged to consider 1 the character of the proposed sign not only in and of itself but also in terms of the effects such a sign will have upon the character of the surrounding area 2 the way in which the sign will be read and whether its size location configuration and character are appropriate to its intended audience or whether a more appropriate sign could better serve its intended purpose and at the same time be less visually disruptive 3 the character of the sign structure that is the physical means of supporting the sign and whether that structure could be made an integral part of the sign rather than a separate and frequently distracting element c the underlying intent and structure of the murfreesboro sign that only those types sizes locations and illuminations of signs that are specifically identified in the subsections of 226 may be constructed erected applied or maintained within the city of murfreesboro and that all others are prohibited notwithstanding this intent and structure certain types and sizes of signs are specifically prohibited for clarity and emphasis this underlying intent and structure allows the city to study new techniques and new technologies and then determine whether and if so to what extent they should be allowed to be incorporated into signs within the city it is not possible to specifically prohibit or even to regulate that which has not yet been brought to the attention of city officials or that which has not been invented or even conceived accordingly the chief building officials authority to render interpretations as provided in 23e includes the authority to determine

categorical pretreatment standards  users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 1 where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with c4 2 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 3 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director may impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e 4 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in c4a c4a below a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must  employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit   currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment   provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions   not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and  have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits b an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must  maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits   continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device   continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph 22f1c of this notification of a revised production rate the director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and  continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraphs 22e1a of this long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the director  will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor   upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and  may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to the industrial user must also be in compliance with regarding the prohibition of bypass 5 the director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the director when converting such limits to concentration limits the director will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by paragraph 26 of this ordinance see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the director will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 6 once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived see 40 cfr 4036c7 7 where categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4day average limitations the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation d state pretreatment standards users must comply with tennessee department of environment and conservation pretreatment standards rules e industrial user production levels any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the director within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate see 40 cfr 4036c9 f local limits 1 the director is authorized to establish instantaneous daily maximum or monthly average local limits pursuant to 40 cfr 4035c the ability of the wastewater treatment facility to function effectively and meet effluent limitations is contingent upon the incoming wastewater flow being within the plant protection criteria parameters additional substances may be added to the plant protection criteria whenever there is a reason to suspect the presence of such substances in quantities such as to interfere with the proper functioning of the treatment facility or its ability to meet effluent standards or when the effluent limits for discharge of wastewater plant effluent are changed policies for the control of regulated discharges in order to achieve and maintain plant protection criteria shall be proposed by the director and recommended by the board to the city council which shall adopt them by resolution such policies shall include provision for any regulated discharger to request and receive a hearing before the board in regard to establishment of discharge conditions or violations thereof the director may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentrationbased limitations of the adopted plant protection criteria 2 grease oil and sand interceptors and grease bins shall be provided when in the opinion of the director they are necessary for

city of murfreesboro tennessee city finds that the further development of cable communications may result in great benefits for the people of the city the city further finds that public rightsofway to be used by a franchisee for the operation of a cable system are valuable public property acquired and maintained by the state and the city the city further finds that the grant of a franchise to use

part of the citys basic infrastructure cable communications systems permanently occupy and extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rightsofway in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them the city finds that public convenience safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the city or such persons as the city so designates to protect the public and to ensure that any cable communications franchise granted is operated in the public interest 2 further it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the citys residents but can provide a variety of broadband interactive communications services 3 in light of the foregoing the following goals among others underlie the provisions set forth in this a cable service should be available to as many city residents as possible b a cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cablerelated needs of the city c a cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so as to maximize the integration of new technology into existing system facilities d a cable system should be responsive to the cablerelated needs and interests of the city and its residents and should promote the widest possible diversity of cable services to the public e a cable operator should pay fair and reasonable compensation to the city for the use of local public rightsofway 4 the city intends that all provisions set forth in this construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes and that any franchise issued pursuant to this construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral

each individually developed parcel or project within the gateway design overlay districts should incorporate existing site specific characteristics such as vegetation topography hydrology and views topography vegetation and hydrology are closely interrelated and have a direct effect on each other disruption to any one updated  app a153 appendix a  zoning element will have repercussions to the others which must be carefully considered 2 views and topography site planning and design must be sensitive to views both into and out of development parcels because viewsheds are directly related to the topographic conditions and roadway alignments of a site the impact of grades on views should be considered to and from rightofways as well as adjacent properties the preservation and enhancement of desirable views should be realized creative placement of all site elements on the site 3 grading and drainage each site development will need to consider grading and drainage in terms of preservation or creation of topographic features the relation of existing and proposed grades to wetlands rivers or drainage ways tree masses and stormwater detention areas as well as the relationship between buildings surface or structured parking roads service courts and adjacent properties to each other and to the site will have a significant influence on the success of the development in terms of its overall impression and aesthetic appeal stormwater will be detained in accordance with the standards for drainage design and stormwater management of the city construction details general concepts and standards to be applied to drainage planning and design are an integral part of these regulations the design intent for treatment of stormwater drainage is to preserve and enhance existing drainage ways new drainage ways shall be designed to appear natural and blend with the landscape this includes the use of broad grassed swales aesthetic stormwater quality facilities with very gentle side slopes the use of natural stone weirs or the creation of naturalistic streambeds headwalls and other drainage structures should be used sparingly the sensitive integration of these types of structures into the landscape setting will be a major criteria used by the city in determining the appropriate and acceptability of design proposals in this regard all development parcels shall consider and apply stormwater drainage techniques that minimize culverts underground structures or other visually and environmentally intrusive techniques in favor of a lower impact approach no modification of existing drainage ways shall be allowed without specific prior written consent of the city engineer detention ponds andor water quality facilities may be required and will be preliminarily designed and coordinated at master plan stage such detention and water quality facilities should be designed to serve multiple sites and should serve as regional facilities to the extent possible detention and retention areas shall be landscaped and screened by use of a combination of vegetation earth berms walls andor other materials consistent with of this article final design of these elements will be required at final design review stage 4 circulation and parking plans for vehicular circulation and parking must consider safety and aesthetic factors relative to the movement of vehicles this includes efforts to minimize conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians to limit paved areas and to screen and soften the visual impact of parking areas both interior updated  app a154 appendix a  zoning and perimeter a street design a consistent streetscape treatment along public rightsofway enhances the appearance of the public domain and provides an attractive unified
