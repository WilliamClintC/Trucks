safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise

provided buffer may be reduced accordingly b up to onehalf of the width of an abutting alley may be counted toward the buffer width requirement but the landscaping density requirements shall not be reduced c whenever the proposed use abuts vacant land buffer requirements shall be based on the zoning of the abutting property or the use projected by the comprehensive plan whichever requires a
