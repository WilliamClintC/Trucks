and some of the residential areas are undeveloped or are areas for potential redevelopment  that the city can maintain a favorable competitive economic position in northern virginia despite the creation of nearby large shopping centers if the city continues to develop its assets of location civic awareness and financial strengths which in recent years have been evidenced by good planning excellent buildings both public and private improvements of streets and sidewalks cityowned parking lots and other demonstrations of how a small city can engage in effective beautification it is also the finding of the city council that the land values of the residential and commercial districts of the city will be enhanced by the prohibition of overhead utility structures accordingly it is the finding of the city council in order to ensure the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city that it requires the installation of all new utility facilities underground further it may be

city wherever feasible is important to the environmental wellbeing of the city enhances property values encourages desirable forms of economic development and provides a stabilizing influence for the communitys cultural and social life the council further finds that visual evidence of the communitys history architecture and characteristic way of life is valuable for educational cultural and recreational purposes b the council finds that residences structures and sites of historical architectural and cultural interest and significance are scattered throughout the small two square mile area of the city such residences and structures consist of a very few built during the colonial period a somewhat larger number built before the civil war and a considerable number built in the period between the civil war and world war i many of these are listed in the citys architectural inventory of 196 as amended the council also finds that structures built as residences during or before 1910 are in general of historic architectural and cultural interest  and that the significance of these structures may be either as noteworthy landmarks recognized for their individual merits or as elements that contribute to the particular qualities of a scene neighborhood or locality which has significance c the council further finds that because of the reasons stated above and because of the scattered location of these structures and sites of historical architectural and cultural significance the entire city should be designated as a historic and cultural conservation district d the council therefore declares that it is the policy of the city to preserve and protect its architectural cultural and historical heritage and to encourage and assist preservation of historically architecturally and culturally significant sites buildings and structures e the purpose of this division is to establish a historic and cultural conservation district it is the intent that the

10  adult uses declaration of policy within the city it is acknowledged that there are some uses often referred to as adult uses which because of their nature can have a negative impact on nearby property particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to a residential neighborhood thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods these special regulations are itemized in this division the primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing the concentration or location of adult uses in a manner that would create such adverse effects the definition of adult uses is found in section 8702  definitions for the purposes of this division certain words and phrases shall have the meanings assigned to them in section 8702 of this except in those situations where the context clearly indicates a different meaning the term person shall mean any individual firm partnership corporation company association or joint stock association  special use permit required for adult uses a special use permit is necessary for the establishment of an adult use as defined in section 8702 in any of the zoning districts where the use is permitted special use permits required for adult uses may be approved only by the city council a special use permit for an adult use may by issued by the city council after finding that the location size design and operating characteristics of the proposed adult use will be compatible with and will not adversely affect or be materially detrimental to the neighboring uses  location and extent of adult uses the following restrictions apply to the location and extent of adult uses in the city 1 except pursuant to subsection 5 below no special use permit shall authorize an adult use less than 500 feet from
