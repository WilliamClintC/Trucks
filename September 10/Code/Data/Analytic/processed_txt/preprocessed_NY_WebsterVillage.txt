sewers refer to of this chapter d all sewers shall satisfy requirements of a final exfiltration or infiltration test before they will be approved and sewage flow accepted from them by the village this test consists of filling the pipe with water to provide a head of at least five feet above the top of the pipe or five feet above groundwater whichever is the highest point of the pipeline test and then measuring the loss of water from the line by the amount which must be added to maintain the original level in this test the line must remain filled with water for at least 24 hours prior to the taking of measurements exfiltration shall be measured by the drop of water level in a standpipe with a closed bottom end or in one of the sewer manholes available for convenient measuring when a

intervals for either type of test shall be as ordered or approved but in no event shall they exceed 1000 feet in the case of sewers laid on steep grades the length of line to be tested by exfiltration

adopted at time of adoption of see ch 1 general provisions art i  1301 introduction  purpose a land disturbance activities and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites b during the construction process soil is the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water this eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates maintenance andor repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of waterways in addition clearing andor grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of the village of webster improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow regulation of land disturbance activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development c as a result the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard public health protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the village of webster
