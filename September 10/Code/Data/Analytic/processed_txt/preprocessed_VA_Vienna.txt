granting of variances generally is limited to a lot size less than onehalf acre deviations from that limitation may occur however as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing a variance increases variances may be issued by the board of zoning appeals for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level in conformance with the provisions of this section 3 variances may be issued for

of zoning appeals shall satisfy all relevant factors and procedures specified in sections of chapter 18 zoning and consider the following additional factors a the danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments no variance shall be granted for any proposed use development or activity within any floodway district that will cause any increase in the 100year flood elevation b the danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others c the proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these

comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area j the safety of access by ordinary and emergency vehicles to the property in time of flood k the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site l the historic nature of a structure variances for repair or rehabilitation of historic structures may be granted upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure m such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this chapter 5 the board of zoning appeals may refer any application and accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities and the adequacy of the plans for flood protection and other related matters 6 variances shall be issued only after the board of zoning appeals has determined that the granting of such will not result in unacceptable or prohibited increases in flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense  and will not create nuisances cause fraud or victimization of the

the board of zoning appeals shall notify the applicant for a variance by written order that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the 100year flood elevation increases the risks to life and property and will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance 9 a record shall be maintained of the notification specified in subsection 8 of this section as well as all variance
