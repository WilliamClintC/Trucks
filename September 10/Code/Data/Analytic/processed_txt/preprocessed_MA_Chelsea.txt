fulfill parking demands noted in subsection f1 of this section that occur at different times of day is strongly encouraged minimum parking requirements in subsection f1 of this section may be reduced by the paa if the applicant can demonstrate that shared spaces will meet parking demands by using accepted methodologies eg the urban land institute shared parking report ite shared parking guidelines or other approved studies c notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein any minimum required amount of parking may be reduced upon a demonstration to the reasonable satisfaction of the paa that the lesser amount of parking will not cause excessive congestion endanger public safety or that lesser amount of parking will provide positive environmental or other benefits taking into consideration 1 the availability of surplus offstreet parking in the vicinity of the use being served andor the proximity of a bus or an mbta transit station  2 the availability of public or commercial parking facilities in the vicinity of the use being served  3 shared use of offstreet parking spaces serving other uses having peak user demands at different times  4 age or other occupancy restrictions which are likely to result in a lower level of auto usage  5 impact of the parking requirement on the physical environment of the affected lot or the adjacent lots including reduction in green space destruction of significant existing trees and other vegetation destruction of existing dwelling units or loss of pedestrian amenities along public ways  and 6 such other factors as may be considered by the paa g design standards 1 site design and building orientation a buildings and landscape elements should be sited to reinforce the street edge by aligning building faces and taller vertical landscape elements along the setback line the setback should be generous enough to allow for tree plantings but shallow enough that the buildings help create a coherent street wall that will inform future patterns of development b required open space should be sited such that it is visually accessible from the street thereby creating a visual amenity for the community where possible c in order to strengthen and define street form corner buildings should align to both street frontages this is especially important at the corner of highland and library streets where the lack of development on corner parcels creates a particularly undefined intersection d parking areas should be sited behind buildings driveways should be located on side streets where possible and garage entries should be located behind buildings or on side streets where possible garage entries facing streets should have doors designed to be compatible with a pedestrian scale and aesthetic characterized by windows panels or other articulations e all curb cuts should be designed so that driveways slope up from the street to the level of the sidewalk curb cuts should not be designed so that the drive is set at the street elevation sidewalks are meant for safe passage of pedestrians curb cuts set at the street elevation not only require pedestrians to step down at every cut but also promote vehicles entering and exiting the drive at faster speeds than those that would be used if the sidewalk were designed so that the pedestrian had the rightofway 2 building character and design a buildings should have the primary entrance oriented to the street on which the building fronts b in order to enhance security interior living spaces should be oriented so that windows give visual access to either the street or any onsite open spaces c to improve the pedestrian scale of the district and reflect the pattern and character of surrounding buildings buildings should include articulations such as cornices bay windows dormers peaked corner turrets or other vertical articulations that add interest and dimension to the building facades larger articulations can be used to create visually accessible open spaces that can be used to satisfy the open space requirements for example a ushaped building with the open part of the ushape landscaped and facing the street long building facades should be broken up with multiple entrances creating the feel of a row of individual buildings d windows should be individual openings in the facade with welldefined lintels and sills rather than band windows e building material should be clapboard painted in light colors larger buildings may be masonry to fit in with older industrial buildings f building tops should be shaped with attention to their view against the sky and to adjacent structures buildings with flat roofs should have a cornice mechanical penthouses and other projections or roof elements that are visible from the street should be architecturally integrated with the overall building design g attention should be paid to the design of front doors with covered front entries or other details to provide interest 3 landscape and screening elements a where space allows sidewalks should be ten feet from curb to back of sidewalk with street trees planted in a continuous fourfoot tree lawn or individual fourfoot tree pits sidewalk width should match adjacent parcels or for fullblock parcels adjacent blocks but never less than a minimum width of five feet b where sidewalks are less than eight feet street trees or other landscaping should be planted in the front setback to create a greener street edge and help mitigate the lack of open space in the neighborhood landscaping should be planted at a sufficient density to make an immediate impact on the pedestrian environment c in order to visually screen surface parking from the street without reducing visual access and security 1 except to allow egress to the property at driveways and walkways where possible surface parking areas should be screened from the street by continuous planting strips a minimum of five feet deep and planted at a density sufficient to create a continuous screen with plantings at least 18 inches but no more than four feet tall 2 in addition to planted screens continuous fencing should be installed on the street side of the planting strip fencing should have black metal pickets at least 18 inches but no more than four feet tall aligning with architectural elements of the adjacent building facade 3 trees may be planted within planting strips provided they do not disrupt the continuity of the required screening and that limbs are removed below a height of 12 feet d in order to promote a sustainable and natural landscape environment plant materials should be restricted to native and noninvasive species h application for plan approval 1 preapplication prior to the submittal of a site plan application a concept plan may be submitted to help guide the development of the definitive site plan for project buildout and individual elements thereof such concept plan should reflect the following a overall building envelope areas  b open space and

than 18 years old 141% usually obtained them by buying them in a store ie convenience store supermarket or discount store or gas station  2  whereas the us department of health and human services has concluded that nicotine is as addictive as cocaine or heroin 3 and the surgeon general found that nicotine exposure during adolescence a critical window for brain development may have lasting adverse consequences for brain development 4 and that it is addiction to nicotine that keeps youth smoking past adolescence 5  whereas a federal district court found that phillip morris rj reynolds and other leading cigarette manufacturers spent billions of dollars every year on their marketing activities in order to encourage young people to try and then continue purchasing their cigarette products in order to provide the replacement smokers they need to survive and that these companies were likely to continue targeting underage smokers  6  whereas more than 80 percent of all adult smokers begin smoking before the age of 18 more than 90 percent do so before leaving their teens and more than 35 million middle and high school students smoke  7  whereas the institute of medicine iom concludes that raising the minimum age of legal access to tobacco products to 21 will reduce tobacco initiation particularly among adolescents 1517 and will improve health across the lifespan and save lives  8  whereas sales of flavored little cigars increased by 23% between 2008 and 2010 9 and many noncigarette tobacco products such as cigars and cigarillos can be sold in a single dose  enjoy a relatively low tax as compared to cigarettes  are available in fruit candy and alcohol flavors  and are popular among youth  10  whereas the federal family smoking prevention and tobacco control act fsptca enacted in 200 prohibited candy and fruitflavored cigarettes 11 largely because these flavored products were marketed to youth and young adults 12 and younger smokers were more likely to have tried these products than older smokers 13  neither federal nor massachusetts laws restrict sales of flavored noncigarette tobacco products such as cigars cigarillos smokeless tobacco hookah tobacco and electronic devices and the nicotine solutions used in these devices  whereas the us food and drug administration and the us surgeon general have stated that flavored tobacco products are considered to be starter products that help establish smoking habits that can lead to longterm addiction  14  whereas the us surgeon general recognized in his 2014 report that a complementary strategy to assist in eradicating tobacco related death and disease is for local governments to ban categories of products from retail sale  15  whereas the us centers for disease control and prevention has reported that current electronic cigarette use among middle and high school students tripled from 2013 to 2014  16  whereas nicotine solutions which are consumed via electronic or batteryoperated delivery smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes are sold in dozens of flavors that appeal to youth such as cotton candy and bubble gum  17  whereas the massachusetts department of environmental protection has classified liquid nicotine in any amount as an acutely hazardous waste 310 cmr   whereas in a lab analysis conducted by the fda electronic cigarette cartridges that were labeled as containing no

students in massachusetts who reported the use of cigars within the past 30 days is 108% in 2013  19  whereas data from the national youth tobacco survey indicate that more than twofifths of us middle and high school smokers report using flavored little cigars or flavored cigarettes  20  whereas in massachusetts youth use of cigars and smokeless tobacco 123% is higher than the rate of current cigarette use 107% for 2013 and has remained elevated since 2009  21  whereas research shows that increased cigar prices significantly decreased the probability of male adolescent cigar use and a 10% increase in cigar prices would reduce use by 34%  22  whereas the sale of tobacco products is incompatible with the mission of health care institutions because these products are detrimental to the public health and their presence in health care institutions undermine efforts to educate patients on the safe and effective use of medication including cessation medication  whereas educational institutions sell tobacco products to a younger population who is particularly at risk for becoming smokers and such sale of tobacco products is incompatible with the mission of educational institutions that educate a younger population about social environmental and health risks and harms  whereas the massachusetts supreme judicial court has held that  the right to engage in business must yield to the paramount right of government to protect the public health by any rational means 23  now therefore it is the intention of the chelsea board of health to regulate the sale of tobacco products b authority this regulation is promulgated pursuant to the authority granted to the chelsea board of health by massachusetts general laws which states boards of health may make reasonable
