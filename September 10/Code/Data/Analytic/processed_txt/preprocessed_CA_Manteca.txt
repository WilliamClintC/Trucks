on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare  2001  appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san joaquin county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  2001  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or chapters f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon the consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems

management program  findings the city council hereby finds and determines as follows a the revised community growth management program growth program is adopted pursuant to the citys police powers under of the california constitution and is intended to promote the health safety and general welfare interests of the residents of the city as specifically set forth herein b the city council has recently adopted the 2003 general plan general plan as updated the general plan contains growth management and other related goals and policies c this growth program is consistent with the general plan and has as its purpose the implementation of the growth management goals policies and other policies contained in the general plan d the sewer treatment plant expansion for the phase three expansion is scheduled to be completed in 2004 the phase three expansion is forecasted to provide capacity for approximately eight years of growth e the city council finds it necessary to continue to coordinate phase three sewer treatment capacity with the number of building permits issued for residential commercial industrial and other development to ensure that new development does not exceed the amount of available sewer capacity and to distribute a limited resource equitably to this end the city council shall adopt by this growth program for phase three a sewer allocation system which shall distribute available sewage treatment capacity between residential commercial industrial and other development f further while the city has immediate sewage treatment capacity constraints which must be addressed the city also has short and longterm general plan goals and policies which must be implemented to this end the city must be able to critique and rate development proposals point rating system to ensure that those projects which best further the goals and policies of the general plan may use the sewage treatment capacity available g it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to implement and advance the goals and policies of the general plan by establishing a mechanism and approach by which a steady orderly and balanced rate of annual residential commercial industrial and other development growth in the city can be achieved and advancing the housing opportunities of the region in which the city is situated while balancing that desired growth and new housing need against the existing and projected public service facility and protection needs of the citys residents and the existing and projected city fiscal environmental and public service resources and constraints in an effort to among other things 1 protect against premature development in the absence of necessary sewage treatment capacity in phase three by ensuring that capacity is available and effectively staged financed and allocated in a manner which will protect against the overextension of existing facilities  2 protect against premature development in the absence of other necessary services facilities and protections by ensuring that those services facilities and protections provided by the city andor other service agencies operating in the city can be properly and effectively staged and financed in a manner which will protect against the overextension of existing facilities  3 provide quality housing opportunities for all economic sectors of the community and region and provide incentives to developers to include low and moderateincome housing in their developments  4 provide a balance between residential commercial industrial and other development  5 provide a balance between single and multifamily residential development in order to implement the residential mix goals and policies of the general plan  and 6 provide a short and longrange growth rate commensurate with the citys historical and projected growth needs h in 198 the city council met with and received input from various community individuals and groups regarding future annual growth rates and determined that a longerrange average annual residential growth rate of up to 39 percent will best serve the needs and desires of the entire community the city council by adopting this growth program affirms that residential growth rate for phase three sewer capacity with some exceptions those exceptions include 1 infill development as defined as follows a residential lots which are legal lots of record or are part of a major subdivision with no more than four remaining undeveloped lots that meet the criteria of subsection h3 of this section  b residential lots which are created by a minor subdivision and which minor subdivision as a whole meet all of the criteria of subsection h1c of this section  c residential development projects that have no more than four units and are surrounded on at least three sides by developed property one of which may be a street except in the case of as defined in title 166 which shall be surrounded on at least two sides by developed property one of which may be a city street  or d a second unit constructed on the same lot as an existing principal residence 2 affordable housing any residential unit or project that meets the affordable housing criteria as defined in this chapter shall be exempt from the growth cap 3 redistributed allocations allocations are deemed redistributed when approved in one year but not used until subsequent years in the event an allocation is granted within the 39percent growth cap in any one year that allocation shall not be calculated against a future years 39percent growth cap since it will have already been counted toward one years cap 4 highdensity development as subject of catchup provision approved by city council in any one year a single development may exceed the 39percent growth cap if it is for highdensity development and approved by the city council to exceed the 39percent growth cap for that year in the event such a project is approved by the city council the growth cap shall then be reduced in the following calendar year so that the combined residential sewer allocations for the two years does not exceed an average of 39 percent for the two years 5 nonlowincome agerestricted senior housing any agerestricted senior housing project as defined in this chapter that enters into a development agreement with the city shall be entitled to receive a maximum of three hundred project allocations per year beyond the 39percent growth cap such project allocations shall come from the agerestricted senior housing category in the land use distribution chart as outlined in this chapter i the residential growth cap of 39 percent shall apply to the provision of project allocations in any one calendar year unless otherwise provided herein and not on actual building permits issued the 39 percent shall be calculated in january of each year multiplying the total number of housing units in the city of manteca as of december 31st of the previous year by 39 percent providing the total number of project allocations available in the following year this process provides for an overall average of 39 percent residential growth over the life of the phase three wastewater quality control facility treatment expansion j the general plan and this chapter will not have a substantial adverse effect on the citys regional fair share as set forth in the general plan and is compatible with state housing goals and regional housing needs because 1 the annual residential growth rate allowed by this chapter under phase three sewer allocation coupled with the growth experience of the city prior to the adoption of the first growth program will cumulatively allow more overall residential development housing opportunities than that contemplated for the city of manteca  2 the point rating systems to be established pursuant to this chapter will provide incentives to developers to include lowincome housing in their development proposals likewise the exemption of affordable housing projects from the 39percent growth cap shall provide additional incentives for developers to provide such housing  3 the general plan contains goals policies and implementation programs for the provision of housing to meet the needs of all income groups in manteca k this growth program presents a reasonable balance and accommodation of the public heath safety and welfare interests advanced by growth management on the one hand and the public health safety and welfare interests advanced by the continued provision of safe sanitary and affordable regional housing on the other hand because it advances the interests listed in subsection j of this section l to the extent this chapter may be determined to reduce the housing opportunities of the region the findings contained in subsection j of this section as to the public health safety and welfare interests promoted by the adoption of this chapter particularly the interests in assuming that adequate sewage capacity is available are found to justify any such reduction in the housing opportunities of the region m in order to implement the goals and policies of the general plan and to accomplish the above findings and determinations which are consistent with those general plan goals and policies the city must be able to control the rate distribution and economic level of proposed development on both a yeartoyear and longterm basis to this end this chapter shall be in effect from and after its effective date date that phase three sewage capacities will have been depleted and new sewage capacities will be available  3 2005   2004  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to implement the goals and policies of the general plan those goals and policies contemplate without limitation any ordinance
