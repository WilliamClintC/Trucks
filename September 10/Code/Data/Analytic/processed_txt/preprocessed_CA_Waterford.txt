efficiently than traditional irrigation methods d reduction of water use conservation protects and promotes the public health safety and welfare by conserving a vital resource that is subject to everincreasing demands e reduction of water demands conservation will reduce the per capita amount of water used by city customers and also will reduce the citys costs for electrical energy equipment

governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges d nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate e generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items c1 10 have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases f upon consideration of the factors of subsection c of this section and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter g the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal insurance administration upon request     conditions for variances a variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section b variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result c variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief d variances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances e variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety f any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the regulatory flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain board in the office of the stanislaus county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land  dwelling unit maintenance  definitions

requirements for the maintenance of all land whether improved or vacant owners and occupants of some properties within the city permit conditions to exist which are below the minimum conditions required by title 8 and title 17 of this code and therefore injurious and inimical to the public health safety and welfare of the residents of the city and contribute substantially and increasingly to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and commercial areas the abatement of certain uses and abuses of property as described in this chapter reasonably relates to the proper exercise of police power to protect the health safety and general welfare of the public abatement of conditions less than those required by title 8 and title 17 of this code will promote health safety and welfare

the city that is injurious to health indecent or offensive to the senses or an obstruction to the free use of property so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property and endangers the health or safety of others   state housing law the city may a declare that a public nuisance exists whenever any member of the public creates causes commits permits or maintains any condition or performs or causes to be performed any activity that falls within the scope of the definition of public nuisance as set forth in of the california health and safety   and b commence any action or proceeding set forth therein to abate the public nuisance to pursue all other remedies against the violator to seek the imposition of all penalties against the violator and to recover any and all costs from the violator   unsecured buildings it is unlawful and constitutes a public nuisance for any responsible party or owner of any property in the city to fail to install or to fail to use reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized entry into any vacant or uninhabited building upon such property except when the owner or responsible party is personally upon the property all exterior openings such as doors and windows affording entry into any building upon such property shall be reasonably secured against unauthorized entry into such building   vacant buildingsdeclaration of purpose the council finds that neglected vacant buildings are a major cause of blight in residential and nonresidential neighborhoods vacant buildings often attract transients and criminals including drug users and prostitutes use of vacant buildings by transients and criminals who may employ primitive cooking or heating methods creates a risk of fire for the vacant building and adjacent properties vacant properties are often used as dumping grounds for drug paraphernalia furniture tires garbage junk and debris and are often overgrown with weeds and grass creating a wide variety of health and safety concerns in addition vacant buildings which are simply boarded up for long periods of time with plywood or other materials to prevent entry by transients or vandals very often discourage economic development disrupting neighborhood stability retarding appreciation of property values and promote visual blight conditions all of which interfere with the rights of neighboring property owners and occupants to the full use and enjoyment of their property the city currently expends resources monitoring and responding to vacant buildings because of the numerous health welfare safety and economic problems caused by neglected vacant buildings there is already a substantial cost to the city for monitoring neglected vacant buildings whether or not those buildings are boarded up as well as substantial toll on the citizens who are affected by the nuisance conditions created therefore the city council finds there is an urgent need to refine the process by which these

are intended land subject to flooding or deemed by the planning commission to be uninhabitable shall not be platted for residential occupancy areas subject to flooding as defined by the most current flood hazard maps for the city shall be noted on the final map with subject to flooding  c all subdivision designs shall attempt to achieve a variety of lot sizes in order to accommodate a full range of housing styles sizes and price ranges in conformance with the housing element of the waterford general plan it shall be expected that a greater variance in lot sizes will exist in larger subdivisions consisting of twentyfive lots or more the integration of housing for all sectors of the community within all areas of the city and to avoid development patterns which result in large sectors of the city which are immediately identifiable as low income or upper income  d no lot shall be divided by a city or special district boundary line division of the lot by a tax code boundary

which shall be included as part of the landscape maintenance district  h no remnants of property with the exception of onefoot control lots and approved nonbuildable sites shall be created which do not conform to lot requirements or which are not required for public or private utility open space or parkland purposes  i all lots shall conform to the requirements contained in this code   walls and fences each lot located on the exterior boundary of the subdivision shall have a wall or fence adequate to prevent access between the lot and adjacent properties subject to the approval of planning director and in compliance with this municipal   noise attenuation a a subdivider as a condition of approval of a tentative map for a subdivision located within an area subject to high traffic noise levels shall comply with the following standards consistent with the general plan and this municipal  noise attenuation considerations in general three basic techniques provide noise attenuation a barriers and earth berm the least desirable method of noise attenuation is a noise barrier or wall improper design can result in an increase in noise deflection thereby making the roadway undesirable to pedestrians and other forms of nonmotorized transportation diffracted path transmitted path and reflected path are the redistribution of the sound energy when a barrier is introduced between the source of the noise and the receiver if no barrier exists between the noise source and adjoining areas the sound will travel in a direct path from the source diminishing only with distance but if a barrier is introduced some attenuation is possible at shorter distances the amount of sound that passes a barrier barrier transmission depends upon the barrier material weight and stiffness and the holes or openings in the barrier in the case of the latter ones any openings or holes may seriously degrade the noise reduction since the sound pressure increases upon striking the barrier wall and this results in an amplification of the transmitted sound materials that provide good sound absorption are concrete masonry brick and granite among others b site and improvement design site and structure design techniques are preferred means to minimize noise impacts on noise sensitive uses techniques such as building placement increased landscaped setbacks orientation of noisetolerant components ie parking utility areas maintenance facilities between the noise source and the receptor and the use of a combination of noise barriers and landscaped berms etc are the most effective means of reducing noise impacts builders and designers should consider alternative architectural designs as a means of meeting noise reduction requirements such as use of noise tolerant rooms kitchen garages bathrooms to shield other noise sensitive rooms or areas living rooms bedrooms i locate bedrooms away from major roadways  ii for building faades use architectural design techniques and materials that will help shield noise  iii avoid balconies or operable windows facing major travel routes c acoustical construction acoustical construction reduces the interior noise level of a building but would not reduce exterior noise levels acoustical construction is recommended when barriers or site design cannot provide all the attenuation necessary acoustical construction techniques include use of double or sound wall placement double pain windows sound insulation that absorbs noise 2 general design considerations a sound walls should be made of materials which have a good sound absorption rate b a combination of sound wall and an earth mound or berm should be utilized along road ways to provide landscape areas and improved noise attenuation c landscaping shall be included in all wall designs to improve the visual impacts of a wall reduce potential for graffiti and reduce noise reflection d wall design should avoid design that provide a flat even alignment and smooth surface to improve acoustic reflection and visual impacts b noise standards on the basis of noise design studies conducted for the proposed subdivision and with special design and noise attenuation as may be required to be implemented the development can be reasonably expected to conform to the following noise standards as set forth in the waterford general plan table  allowable noise standards

commission may grant variances from the provisions of this chapter when findings can be made that all the following conditions exist if the variance is approved a that the variance granted shall be subject to such conditions as will assure that the adjustment thereby authorized shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the same vicinity  b that special circumstances applicable to the subject property including size shape topography location or surroundings the strict literal application of the provisions of this chapter are found to deprive the subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity  c under the circumstances of any particular case the requested variance rather than the sections at issue in this chapter actually carries out the spirit and intent of the provisions of this chapter  d in the determination of the planning commission the overall project will be substantially improved

adopted specific plan and comparable regulations of this code the specific plan will prevail   authority specific plans are authorized by california government et seq which specifies minimum contents and provides for fees and an additional environmental review procedure    applicability a specific plan zoning may be considered for areas within the existing city limits or where areas are considered for annexation the specific plan zoning may be used on any size of land mass but normally will be applicable for sites of fifty acres or larger to be considered for application of the sp zoning district an area should possess one or more of the following characteristics a rapidly andor newly urbanizing with significant new demand for public facilities and services b possessing unique physical cultural or locational conditions in particular significant natural resources to be preserved or utilized but including any other unusual conditions which warrant special care in planning  c

marginal   delineation of specific plan areas it is not necessary for specific plan areas to be delineated on the general plan land use map on the zoning map a specific plan district will be delineated in a manner similar to that of any other zoning district except that each sp zoned area shall also bear a number which distinguishes it from other specific plan areas in most cases an adopted specific plan will create zoning categories unique to that plan  those zoning categories will be described within the plan itself rather than on the zoning map or in this code the zoning categories created by the specific plan will be placed on the zoning map as information to the general public   procedure a a specific plan shall be adopted by ordinance or resolution following public hearings before the planning commission and city council for subject areas which are expected to benefit by updating signage for example supplementary documents such as design standard may also be adopted by ordinance or resolution application for other entitlements may be made simultaneously with the specific plan application in some circumstances simultaneous applications may in fact be necessary b prior to or concurrent to adoption of a specific plan the plan area must be zoned sp and assigned a number as required in the zoning and specific plan applications may be processed

of the specific plan an initial study shall be prepared for all subsequent application to determine whether a supplement or an addendum to the eir must be prepared or if the project is exempt from further environmental review   expiration and extension since specific plan applications are flexible expiration will be determined on a casebycase basis like other city regulations most specific plan approvals will not expire unless replaced by a subsequently adopted specific plan or rendered obsolete by adoption of a conflicting general plan amendments and conflicting goals and policies of the general plan in some cases however limiting the duration of an approval may be appropriate  ie when the specific plan is linked to another entitlement which expires such as tentative subdivision map the ordinance or resolution adopting a specific plan shall specify the duration of the specific plan and any means of extension which may include an evaluation of an applicants due diligence in

and congestion and to promote over all community well being and economic vitality these standards are intended to accommodate and foster pedestrian usage by combining commercialretail uses and residential uses in the same buildings or in close vicinity of each other the interaction of these different uses during day and evening hours provides a dynamic that can not usually be created with typical single use zones this concept harkens back to a village where people lived and worked in close proximity this concept also tries to reduce dependency upon the automobile makes pedestrians a focal point and encourages human interaction smaller scale buildings and a vibrant sidewalk environment b for projects in those zoning districts where mixeduse developments are allowed the following design review standards shall apply c these standards shall be applied to both new development proposed on vacant land and the retrofitting of existing improvements and building to mixed uses   types of mixed use development mixed use developments may be proposed in two ways a establishment of a new permitted or conditionally permitted use within a zoning district where mixed use development is allowed b establishment of a mixeduse development that proposes a new development or complex that will accommodate mixed uses typically these would be proposed in any commercial or industrial zone and be approved as planned community pc in accordance with or a specific plan district sp in accordance with   mixed use land use standards a schedule 421 below prescribes the land use regulations for districts within which mixed uses are allowed unless otherwise not allowed in the specific zoning district within which the mixed use development or use is proposed the regulations for each use are established by letter designations as follows p designates use classifications permitted in residential districts l designates use classifications that are permitted subject to certain limitations t designates use classifications that are permitted to be conducted for a limited period of time and that require a temporary use permit pursuant to au designates a use classification permitted in the

site plans and architectural designs in mixeduse proposals the architectural site plan review committee will make urban design decisions based on the following guidelines to promote visual quality in these areas of the city b site plan review will examine the location intensity and type of uses proposed within a mixed use proposal and address the relationship of proposed uses to surrounding uses in the neighborhood and immediately adjacent to the project site or building   overall proposal design a mixeduse proposal should create a new diverse and pedestrianfriendly neighborhood environment with a mix of housing shopping workplace and entertainment uses and nodes for transportation access all within a short walk of each other a range of types sizes amenities and uses will enhance a series of inviting functional public spaces including shopping streets and pedestrian friendly streetscapes open spaces courtyards trails residential office and retail in mixeduse buildings the design principles for buildings and streets are taken from traditional small towns that provided a closein community life b to foster pedestrian usage in the mixeduse proposal the construction of new sidewalks must be a minimum of ten feet in width whenever feasible c properties or development projects abutting major streets in the district should have zero to tenfoot setbacks from the rightofway

accommodate bus stops and similar amenities as approved by the city engineer and local transit system operator   overall architectural design where new construction is proposed the following design standards are encouraged where existing development is to be used for mixeduse concepts redevelopment should examine opportunities to conform to these standards a building design concepts should respond to the site plan by forming street edges and by encouraging active safe street life offering a variety of activities buildings should recognize site patterns and help define entries to interior courtyards building entrances and public spaces to encourage family and community activities b use architectural styles that are associated with traditional neighborhood design and newer multifamily designs that delineate separation of the units commercial architectural styles should mimic the old main street concept c the architectural designs should utilize a variety of roof forms to create diverse elevations residential units office and commercialretail spaces should overlook the streets and courtyards as part of a unified and defined sense of space d parapets cornices shed roofs dormers and other secondary roof forms create variety in the units and break up the massing of the overall buildings varied roof heights and roof elements also serve to reinforce the diverse experience of the streetscape vertical elements such as bays and decks which sometimes carry to the ground and to upper levels help to create variation in the facade that modulate the building facade e the materials used in design of the buildings should also reinforce the diverse experience of the elevations roof colors should be coordinated to complement the color schemes f plaza or courtyard materials can be used to create a community space use of color and scoring as patterns in the hardscape landscape creates diversity provides color and softens the building and hardscape environment while benches or seating areas play areas and public art help residents and visitors enjoy the space and environment making it a place where people want to visit shop live and recreate   residential

implement crime prevention design cepted principal in project design a purpose cepted design principals recognize that the physical environment can be manipulated to produce behavioral effects that will reduce the fear and incidence of crime while improving quality of life secondly cepted principals provide a conceptual framework derived from this insight which serves to develop and ensure a better designed property it is development of this design that crime and loss is kept to a minimum that is because cpted believes that crime and loss are byproducts of human functions that are not working properly b strategy there are three overlapping cpted design strategies 1 natural surveillance is a design strategy that is directed at keeping intruders under observation 2 natural access control is a design strategy that is directed at decreasing crime opportunity the primary thrust of an access control strategy is to deny access to a crime target and to create a perception of risk in offenders 3 territorial reinforcement is an umbrella design strategy that realizes that physical design can create or extend a sphere of influence so that users of a property develop a sense of proprietorship over it territorial strategies will often embody natural surveillance and natural access control strategies c implementation cepted principals shall be implemented in the city of

prevention design cpted standards a review projects for conformance with and implementation of cpted design strategies 1 natural surveillance is a design strategy that is directed at keeping intruders under observation 2 natural access control is a design strategy that is directed at decreasing crime opportunity the primary thrust of an access control strategy is to deny access to a crime target and to create a perception of risk in offenders 3 territorial reinforcement is an umbrella design strategy that realizes that physical design can create or extend a sphere of influence so that users of a property develop a sense of proprietorship over it territorial strategies will often embody natural surveillance and natural access control strategies b natural surveillance design standard 1 design space to facilitate observation by increasing visual permeability ie the ability to see what is ahead and around measure the need for privacy andor limited sightlines against the need for personal safety 2 is this level responsive to the needs for observation place vulnerable activities such as cash handlingchild care and others in places that can be naturally wellmonitored develop potential for eyes on the street by strategically aligning windows work stations and other activity generators towards these areas of vulnerable activity 3 has the need for observation been carried consistently throughout the project take special care to ensure that each phase of the project enhances and complements natural surveillance opportunities created in the design phase this is particularly critical with respect to the landscaping and lighting phases as an example multifamily houses can be strategically designed and placed to maximize observation to the entrance of the streets and the neighboring homes c natural access control design standard 1 does the design decrease criminal opportunity by effectively guiding and influencing movement provide for eyes on the street strategic placement of entrances windows etc direct normal access to observable areas and prevent access to unobservable areas design space to provide people with a sense of direction while giving them some natural indication as to where they are and are not allowed 2 will safety be compromised by limiting access provide a limited number of access routes while allowing users some flexibility in movement 3 does the design develop natural access control opportunities without considering their impact on natural surveillance take special care to ensure that natural access control opportunities enhance and complement natural surveillance objectives as an example multiple entrances into this parking lot can be replaced by a single well observed entrance that includes a fence and control gate d territorial reinforcement design standard 1 does the design act as a catalyst for natural surveillance and access control opportunities enhance the feeling of legitimate ownership by reinforcing existing natural surveillance and natural access control strategies with symbolic or psychological barriers accomplish this by demonstrating the transition between public semipublic and private space so that unwanted intrusion elicits a protective response that offenders will perceive this is often easily accomplished with the strategic use of bollards and signs 2 does the design create ambiguous spaces minimize the creation of ambiguous spaces a space is ambiguous when it lacks any sort of clue as to what it is for and who it is for accomplish this by identifying potential leftover spaces for instance landscape areas take some positive design action to develop this space so that users of the property take responsibility for it 3 will the design create heavy or unreasonable maintenance demands design space to allow for its continued use and intended purpose create durable environments that limit the need for maintenance especially where it affects natural surveillance and access control   appeals any action taken by the committee and the planning commission in considering a site plan application may be appealed to the city council pursuant to the

listed in the specific purposes of the offstreet parking and loading regulations are to a ensure that offstreet parking and loading facilities are provided for new land uses and for major alterations and enlargements of existing uses in proportion to the need for such facilities created by each use b establish parking standards for commercial uses consistent with need and with the feasibility of providing parking on specific commercial sites c ensure that offstreet parking and loading facilities are designed in a manner that will ensure efficiency protect the public safety and where appropriate insulate surrounding land uses from adverse impacts   basic requirements for offstreet parking and loading a when required at the time of initial occupancy of a site construction of a structure or major alteration or enlargement of a site or structure offstreet parking facilities and offstreet loading facilities shall be provided in accord with the regulations prescribed in this chapter except that for the purposes of these requirements major alteration or enlargement shall mean a change of use or an addition that would increase the number of parking spaces or loading berths by not less than ten percent of the total number required prior to the alteration or enlargement b nonconforming parking or loading no existing use of land or structure shall be deemed to be nonconforming solely because of the lack of offstreet parking or loading facilities required by this chapter  provided that facilities being used for offstreet parking and loading as of the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this title shall not be reduced in number to less than that required by the provisions of this chapter c spaces required for alteration or enlargement the number of parking spaces or loading berths required for an alteration or enlargement of an existing use or structure or for a change of occupancy shall be in addition to the number of spaces or berths existing prior to the alteration enlargement or change of occupancy unless the preexisting number is greater than the number prescribed in this chapter in this case the number of spaces or berths in excess of the prescribed minimum shall be counted in determining the required number of spaces or berths d spaces required for multiple uses if more than one use is located on a site the number of offstreet parking spaces and loading berths to be provided shall be equal to the sum of the requirements prescribed for each use if the gross floor area of individual uses on the same site is less than that for which a loading berth would be required by table 541 but the aggregate gross floor area of all uses is greater than the minimum for which loading berths would be required the aggregate gross floor area shall be used in determining the required number of loading berths e joint use offstreet parking and loading facilities required by this chapter for any use shall not be considered as providing parking spaces or loading berths for any other use except where the provisions of collective provision of parking apply or a joint facility exists such a facility shall contain not less than the total number of spaces or berths as determined individually subject to the provisions of subsection g of this section or fewer spaces may be permitted where adjoining uses on the same site have different hours of operation and the same parking spaces or loading berths can serve both without conflict a determination of the extent if any to which joint use will achieve the purposes of this chapter shall be made by the planning director who may require submission of survey data necessary to reach a decision f location and ownership parking in an r district required to serve a residential use shall be on the same site as the use served parking required to serve a nonresidential use may be on the same or a different site under the same or different ownership as the use served  provided that parking shall be within the following distances of the use served measured from the near corner of the parking facility to the entrance of the use served via the shortest pedestrian route customervisitor spaces employee spaces 200 feet 400 feet facilities for offsite parking shall be restricted to that use by a recorded deed lease or agreement for a minimum period of ten years from the

chapter are provided no use may be continued if the parking is removed unless substitute parking facilities are provided g r districts no offsite parking for a nonresidential use shall be permitted in an r district unless the nonresidential use served is permitted or conditionally permitted in the r district where the offsite facility is to be located h reserved parking spaces for multifamily residential uses no more than one parking space shall be reserved for the exclusive use of an individual unit unless additional parking is provided above the amount required by this section such additional parking may be assigned for the exclusive use of an individual unit i common loading facilities the offstreet loading facilities requirements of this chapter may be satisfied by the permanent allocation of the prescribed number of berths for each use in a common truck loading facility  provided that the total number of berths shall not be less than the sum of the individual requirements as a requirement of approval an attested copy of a contract between the parties concerned setting forth an agreement to joint use of the common truck loading facility shall be filed with the application for a zoning permit j computation of spaces required if in the application of the requirements of this chapter a fractional number is obtained one parking space or loading berth shall be required for a fraction of onehalf or more and no space or berth shall be required for a fraction of less than onehalf k uses smaller than two thousand square feet deviations from regular parking standards may be approved by the planning director for uses smaller than two thousand square feet circumstances which would warrant such consideration and possible approval include 1 a shared parking arrangement which meets the findings in  submission of data substantiating that a particular use meets the findings in  ample onstreet parking 4 a reduction in the standard parking requirement would result in an onsite benefit such as preservation of heritage trees substantial landscape screening a unique structure or other similar site attributes   offstreet parking and loading spaces required

it is very difficult to meet the states legal requirements for granting zone variances variances are also not permitted for uses of property not authorized in a particular zone b minor deviations are minor adjustments from setback standards and may be considered with more leniency than variances based on criteria in subsection c3 of this section application for and action on zone variances from development standards are considered at a public hearing by the planning commission with notice as provided in similar to conditional use applications applications for minor deviations are acted on by the planning director after notice is given to adjacent property owners 2 minor deviation criteria the planning director may grant a minor deviation from zone code setback requirements for property subject to the finding the deviation does not grant such property privileges not enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity under identical zoning classification and further that the minor deviation
