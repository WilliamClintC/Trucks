conservation subdivision is a technique that concentrates development in one or more compact areas on the site in exchange for conserving open space and natural areas elsewhere on the site the minimum lot sizes setbacks and frontage requirements for the zone are relaxed in order to create open space on the site the municipal ordinance typically permits the same amount of development that is already permitted the key difference is that this technique requires new construction to be located on only a portion  typically half  of the parcel this new construction should incorporate buffers landscaping and design features to preserve the rural character of the zone in which it is located the remaining open space is permanently protected under a conservation easement held by a land trust the municipality itself or under such terms as the parties may agree traditional subdivision  development of entire parcel with lots conservation subdivision  development of portion of site with same

subdivisions applications submitted to the town of holden planning board shall be conservation subdivisions a policy it is the policy of the town of holden to require the use of conservation subdivisions in order to preserve a sense of space provide for sustainable agriculture and forestry as well as recreational land preserve other resources identified in the town of holden comprehensive plan and harmonize new development with the traditional open wooded agricultural rural and village landscapes of the town this performance standard is intended to implement that policy by providing incentives that afford flexibility to landowners in road and lot layout and design and road frontage requirements and by allowing the planning board to expedite procedure and to waive or reduce certain otherwise applicable standards and provisions of this subdivision incentives are designed to encourage greater flexibility and more innovative approaches to housing and environmental design for the development of single and multifamily residential areas that will promote the most appropriate use of land and will preserve as permanent open space agricultural or forestry land important natural features wildlife habitat water resources ecological systems and historic and scenic areas for the benefit of present and future residents b purposes to qualify for approval as a conservation subdivision the planning board must find that the proposed conservation subdivision will achieve the following purposes that are applicable to its specific circumstances 1 long term protection and conservation of existing natural and other resources and landscapes identified in the comprehensive plan including but not limited to a statedefined critical areas and unique natural features located on the parcel to be subdivided  b historic land use patterns and historic structures  c points of visual access to or from water bodies scenic vistas and points of access to water bodies  d contiguous stands of mature trees  or e other significant open space areas 2 maintenance or establishment of compatibility with surrounding land uses and the overall rural character of the town as envisioned by the comprehensive plan  3 provision of adequate buffers for adjoining properties where needed  4 contribution to townwide open space planning by creating a system of permanently preserved open space both within large parcels of land and among such parcels throughout the town and by encouraging linkages between open space areas  5 conservation of land suitable or actively used for agriculture and forestry uses particularly where the conservation subdivision borders active agricultural or forestry land or land suitable for the same  6 conservation of traditional land uses  7 creation of choices in the type of environment business or residential and type of housing available that will be a longterm asset to the town of holden  8 construction of affordable housing  9 provision of recreation facilities including active and passive recreational space in the most suitable locations for use consistent with the other purposes of this performance standard  10 attainment of planned variety and coordination in the location of structures and building forms and relationships  and 11 avoidance of strip development along the towns road networks c grouping contiguous parcels in order to increase design flexibility two or more contiguous parcels of land under the same or different ownership including parcels separated by a public or private road may be grouped together as one conservation subdivision if the planning board finds that such grouping will benefit the town and that it helps achieve the purposes set forth in paragraph b d maximum number of lots allowed see also paragraph f the maximum number of lots allowed shall be calculated in the following manner 1 determine the land suitable for development of the parcel according to general performance standards land not suitable for development of the town of holden subdivision   then 2 divide the land suitable for development by the minimum lot size required in the zoning obtain the maximum number of lots allowed  then 3 subtract the land area that would be needed for internal roads if it were not a conservation subdivision and recalculate the maximum allowable number of lots by a multiplying the required frontage in the zone by the gross number of lots determined in #2 above divide by two this method assumes a doubleloaded street and multiply by the 50 foot right of way for example if the required frontage is 300 feet and the gross number of lots is 1o 300 x 10   3000 multiply the required frontage by the gross number of lots 30002   1500 divide the result 3000 by 2 to account for doublefrontage lots 1500 x 50   75000 square feet multiply the result 1500 by the frontage to get 75000 b subtract the resulting square footage obtained in 3a above from the land suitable for development  and c divide the revised land suitable for development figure by the lot size requirement in the zone to obtain the maximum number of lots allowable 4 density bonus when the planning board determines that a density bonus is warranted multiply the result obtained in 3c by 115 if the proposed development will provide for one of the following 4a or 4 b below or 120 if the proposed development will provide for both of the following 4a and 4b below and round to the nearest whole number a density bonus may be allowed by the planning board for a affordable housing acceptable to the town that meets the standards for affordable housing contained in the current affordability index for the town of holden prepared by the maine state housing authority when at least 10% of the housing units in the proposed subdivision or provided by the subdivider elsewhere in town will be affordable and mechanisms acceptable to the town are proposed to ensure that such units remain affordable  andor b public access to usable open

sought to be preserved  3 in locations least likely to block or interrupt scenic historic and traditional land use views as seen from public roadways and great ponds  4 within woodlands or along the far edges of open agricultural fields adjacent to any woodland to reduce encroachment upon agricultural soils to provide shade in the summer and shelter as well as solar gain in the winter and to enable new residential development to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features  5 in such manner that the boundaries between residential or business lots and active agricultural or forestry land are well buffered by vegetation topography roads or other barriers to minimize potential conflict between residential or business and agricultural or forestry uses  6 in locations where buildings may be oriented with respect to scenic vistas natural landscape features topography and natural drainage areas in accordance with an overall plan for site development  7 in locations that provide compatibility in terms of physical size visual impact intensity of use proximity to other structures and density of development with other permitted uses within the land use district  8 in locations such that diversity and originality in lot layout and individual building street parking layout are encouraged  and 9 so that individual lots buildings street and parking areas shall be designed and
