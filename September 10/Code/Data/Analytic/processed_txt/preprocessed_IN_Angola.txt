provisions  purpose ait is recognized that storm sewers and their respective receiving drainage ditches tiles streams channels wetlands lakes and other drainage ways serving the city of angola may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff resulting when land use changes from agricultural or other open uses to a more urbanized use covering previous uncovered or undeveloped land it is further recognized that deposits of sediment from developments during and after construction can reduce capacities of storm sewers and drainage systems and result in damages to receiving streams and lakes bstormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and increased runoff flows and velocities which overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increases the cost to the public to manage stormwater cinadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge da program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the city of angola and all the people of the state of indiana their resources and the environment estormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality fpublic education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater gfederal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their municipal separate storm sewer systems ms4 under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes hnonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the state of indiana by the city of angola itherefore it shall be the policy of the city of angola adopted by the common council and administered by the board of public works and safety the board that the storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff and the control of erosion and sediment shall be required of all new development any redevelopment and other new construction in the city including residential subdivisions and planned unit developments and the paving of areas that were previously undeveloped or stonegravel materials because topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for storm runoff vary with almost every site the requirements for storm drainage tend to be an individual matter for any project it is recommended that each project be discussed with the city engineers office or the ms4 operator at the earliest practical time in the planning stage 01  conflicting ordinances the provisions of this article shall be deemed as additional requirements to minimum standards required by other ordinances of the city in the case of conflicting requirements the most restrictive shall apply when stormwater runoff from proposed developments redevelopments and other new construction will outlet directly to a steuben county legal drain or other natural drainage way the proposed development redevelopment and other new construction may also need to comply with the steuben county storm drainage and erosion control the board may therefore also require a letter from the steuben county drainage board indicating that the stormwater and erosion and sediment control plans have been submitted to and approved by the steuben county drainage board 02  compliance with other ordinances in addition to the requirements of this article compliance with the requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances with respect to submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats improvements plans building and zoning permits construction inspections appeals and similar matters and compliance with

authorization the indiana legislature has in ic3674 local planning and zoning granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions therefore the city of angola does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations udo 533a1  findings of fact athe flood hazard areas within the planning and zoning jurisdiction of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages udo 533a2  statement of purpose it is the purpose of the floodplain standards to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or flood velocities brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development that may increase erosion or flood damage eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands fmake federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the planning and zoning jurisdiction of the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program udo 533a3  objectives the objectives of the floodplain standards shall be ato protect human life and health bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public dto minimize prolonged business
