title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title

on ground water as its sole source for public drinking water protection of the quality of ground water is essential to ensure future prosperity and health the purpose of this chapter is to provide standards for location construction maintenance rehabilitation sealing abandonment and destruction of all wells test wells and certain exploration holes so the quality of the ground water is not polluted contaminated or otherwise impacted in a manner which will jeopardize the health safety or welfare of the citizens of the city the intent of these standards is to prevent mixing or transfer of degraded waters into aquifers of good quality water or open borings these standards are written to address the specific hydrogeologic conditions of the city  1990 prior code  291   applicability the standards set forth in this chapter apply to all new and existing water wells monitoring wells cathodic protection wells test wells and those exploratory holes deeper than twenty feet within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city  1990 prior code  292   special ground water protection the city is underlain by various geologic units which consist of unconsolidated and consolidated sediments that contain permeable layers or aquifers of varying depth and dimension intermixed with low permeability sediments the citys water supply relies on the production of ground water from three aquifer zones which are separated by low permeability layers these three aquifers are called the shallow intermediate and mehrten layers of lower permeability are common but three distinctive and generally continuous layers are known these low permeability layers are called the shallow confining layer the corcoran clay and the foot clay deeper aquifers of good quality water may also exist and must be protected recent pollution and contamination by organic chemicals has been found in the shallow and intermediate aquifers because it has been determined that ground water problems are known to exist all ground water within the citys sphere of influence is hereby designated pursuant to authority granted under the state of california water as requiring special ground water protection the intent of

to demonstrate after installation of the proposed alternative grease control device its effectiveness to control fog discharge visual monitoring of the public sewer for at least three 3 months at its own expense a variance may be granted if the results show no visible accumulation of fog in the fses sewer lateral andor tributary downstream sewer lines any variance issued pursuant to this section may be revoked at any time in the discretion of the city engineer b conditional waiver of requirement to install grease interceptor a conditional waiver of the requirement to install a grease interceptor may be granted for fses that the city engineer determines to have negligible fog discharges and an insignificant impact to the public sewer although a waiver from installation of a grease interceptor may be granted the fse may be required to provide space and plumbing segregation for future installation of a grease interceptor the city engineers determination to grant or revoke a conditional waiver shall be based upon but not limited to evaluation of the following conditions 1 quantity of fog discharges as measured or indicated by the size of the fse based on water usage menu

waiver of grease interceptor installation requirement with a grease disposal mitigation fee where the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible and no equivalent alternative grease control device can be installed an fse may be granted a waiver of the grease interceptor requirement upon the payment of a grease disposal mitigation fee as described in additional requirements may also be imposed to mitigate the discharge of fog into the public sewer the city engineers determination to grant the waiver upon the payment of a grease disposal mitigation fee will be based upon but not limited to evaluation of the following conditions 1 there is inadequate space for installation andor maintenance of a grease interceptor 2 there is inadequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor andor between the grease interceptor and the sewer lateral or the public sewer 3 the fse does not qualify for a variance from the requirement to install a grease interceptor pursuant to subsection a d application for variance or waiver of grease interceptor installation requirements an fse may submit to the city of merced industrial waste division an application for a waiver or variance from the grease interceptor requirements in the fse bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor is not feasible or otherwise

adopt the following floodplain management regulations  11172008   findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city of merced are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effort of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss  11172008   purposes it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  g to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and h to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions  11172008   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective biers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  d controlling fill grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  11172008   definitions unless

that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature though these standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in general a properly issued variance is granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners the city of merced desires to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  11172008   appeals board a the city council of the city of merced shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter b the city council shall hear and

with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges d any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the city engineer that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land e the city engineer will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report

level providing that the procedures of have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf  acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall only be issued upon 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a hereof are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety g upon consideration of the factors in subsection c of the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter  11172008   severability this chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable should any

future needs and is approved the data sources and methodology upon which fees are based are available for public inspection at the city clerks office during regular business hours the amount of the fees imposed have been based upon reasonable estimates of capital costs of public facilities expansions that will in probability be incurred by local government as the result of new development the

imposed do not exceed the proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be incurred by the city of merced in accommodating new development the following factors have been considered in determining proportion share 1 the need for public facilities capital improvements required to serve new development based on a capital improvement program that shows deficiencies in capital facilities serving
