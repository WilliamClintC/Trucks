polystyrene products in order to promote the public health reduce solid waste disposal and litter protect air quality and the ozone layer protect wildlife livestock and the environment  1989 findings the city council finds acurrent available evidence shows that polystyrene foam food or drink containers create or contribute to significant health and litter problems in the city bpolystyrene foam or drink containers are an ubiquitous and lightweight source of litter because they are not biodegradable they constitute a significant portion of accumulated litter cthe light weight of polystyrene containers enables them to fly into waterways and livestock enclosures where they may be ingested causing illness or death to wildlife and domestic animals or livestock dmedical evidence suggests that styrene a toxic chemical may leach into food or drink from polystyrene foam containers jeopardizing the public health eavailable evidence shows that chlorofluorocarbons are sometimes used as blowing agents in polystyrene foam manufacture which damage the ozone layer protecting the earth from dangerous ultraviolet radiation and may create lowerlevel air pollution while some polystyrene foam manufacturers have begun to use less dangerous blowing agents which are less damaging to the environment air quality and ozone protection continue to be threatened fin addition polystyrene foam food containers present a solid waste management problem such containers require solid waste disposal in landfills which may experience fires evidence suggests that uncontrolled incineration of polystyrene foam may release toxic emissions threatening air quality and public health complex chemical reactions may occur releasing potentially harmful emissions or leachates gthe presence of polystyrene foam in waste streams is particularly problematic because there is currently no market for the recycling of the polystyrene foam halternatives to polystyrene foam food or drink containers are readily available in the form of paper or nondisposable packaging ithe collection of polystyrene litter and the disposal of polystyrene waste results in direct costs to the city jthe city council supports a ban on all uses of polystyrene not deemed absolutely critical until such bans are in effect responsible action to reduce polystyrene use and alert the public to the potential dangers of these

of california has recognized by the adoption of special legislation regulating tenancies of mobilehome owners in mobilehome parks that there is a significant distinction between tenants of mobilehome parks and other dwelling units and the council likewise has recognized that tenants of mobilehome parks unlike apartment tenants or residents of other rental stock are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment in a residence the space for which is rented or leased as distinguished from owned the physical removal and relocation of a mobilehome from a rented or leased space within a mobilehome park can be accomplished only at substantial cost and inconvenience with the concurrent ability to find another location and in many instances the removal requires a separation of the mobilehome unit from appurtenances which have been made permanent thus creating severe damage and depreciation in value to the mobilehome as a result of the absence of vacant spaces and park restrictions on accepting mobilehomes that are not new it is virtually impossible for mobilehome owners to move their mobilehomes from one park to another park within the city bthe city council finds and declares that the existing mobilehome parks in the city are the only lands designated for mobilehome parks by the 19852005 sonoma general plan and no new sites for mobilehome parks are anticipated  that the average value of a mobilehome $47527 is less than 20 percent of the average value of a home in sonoma making mobilehomes an important source of affordable housing for the community  that 30

annual income of $15350 or less as determined by the us government department of housing and urban development cstudies and hearings have shown that there is presently within the city and surrounding areas a shortage of spaces for the location of mobilehomes resulting in a low vacancy rate space rent increases at the time of sale or other transfer of a mobilehome within a park have been shown to be as great as a 50 percent increase over the pretransfer rent in some mobilehome parks rent increases in the past decade have been substantially in excess of the increases in the consumer price index drapidly rising and large incremental increases in space rent have resulted in an atypical market depression in the resale value of mobilehomes within the city ebecause of the shortage and potential for rapidly rising rates regulation is necessary to assure that economic hardship to a substantial number of mobilehome park tenants in the city many of whom are senior citizens on low fixed incomes does not occur fpursuant to studies and hearings conducted by the city council and city staff the city council has determined it necessary and in the public interest to establish a mechanism to assist in the resolution of disputes that may arise from time to time between tenants and management of mobilehome parks regarding the rates charged for the rental or lease of space gtherefore the city council does accordingly find and declare that it is necessary to establish a means to provide protection to mobilehome park tenants from unreasonable rent increases while at the same time recognizing the need of mobilehome park management to receive a fair return and to receive rent increases sufficient to cover increased cost of repairs maintenance service insurance upkeep and other amenities

general purpose the purpose of architectural review of signs is to ensure that their design and placement will be compatible with the buildings on or near to which they are located and will further the unique and pleasant atmosphere of sonoma variety of attractive signs the applicant should be aware of sonomas character before designing a sign and should design it with the style of the building and the ambience of the town in mind a sign should be architecturally a part of the design of the building that it is identifying rather than a feature independent of and in conflict with the design of the building the following guidelines should assist the designer in determining what would be appropriate and what would not be appropriate these guidelines have been categorized into various elements of signage including size material color letter style lighting placement and logos symbols or pictures these elements however must fit together to create the sign which in turn must be considered on the basis of its total appearance note these design guidelines are general and should be used only as a guide in designing a sign they are based on the existing buildings in town but may not cover every situation size although the maximum size of the sign is controlled by this title the size of the sign shall be considered in relation to the building mass involved and the other elements mentioned herein especially the signs placement a flat wall sign can be considerably larger than other types of signs as flat signs are not generally obtrusive projecting signs normally encroach into the rightofway and need less size to be noticeable detached freestanding signs are the most obvious type of sign and therefore also need considerably less size than a wall sign nor are they dependent on a building structure for placement but can be placed to the best advantage on the site larger signs are justified in areas where business is primarily dependent upon vehicular traffic while smaller signs can be sufficient for pedestrian traffic areas a sign out of proportion in size with others in the area is not to be encouraged even though possibly within the maximum of this title any sign permitted to exceed the maximum sign size as established by this title by reason of any additional size permitted must be determined to be unobtrusive necessary and not out of proportion to other signs in the area materials materials should be considered in relation to the building involved as well as to the town in general sign materials chosen should be geared to the architecture and materials of the building for which the sign is being designed adobespanish style buildings for adobe and spanish style buildings where stucco cement block slumpstone and so forth are the main components natural wood with painted or carved lettering is the most appropriate sign material as it was the signing material used with this type of construction in historical times brick and stone buildings a brick or stucco building of the early 20th century style is most adaptable to a painted wooden sign or even exposed neon tubing on plastic a permit for a neon sign will be granted only in exceptional cases when the design of the sign is especially pleasing and appropriate with the building wooden or old west buildings wooden victorian style buildings echoing the late 19th early 20th century and old west period are generally most compatible with painted or natural wood signs at times some alternate material might be made to resemble wood or can have a similar effect for example plastic may be made to resemble natural or painted wood in color but the total effect is rarely that of the copied material great care should be taken in designing plastic signs with interior illumination because such signs may be incongruous with historic architecture when plastic is to be used careful attention should be given to all of the other elements of design a number of the 19th and 20th century buildings have made excellent use of painted signs on the windows again great care should be taken when using this signing method as when used improperly it can present a cluttered appearance to the window when used properly this signing method can be very appropriate and emphasize the period of the building color the colors of a sign should be harmonious and complementary to the colors of the building on or near which it is to be located fewer colors will generally produce the most attractive sign the colors should also be reasonably compatible with the general character of sonoma psychedelic or phosphorescent colors really do not belong in sonoma in some cases the color of the sign can make a rather incompatible material more compatible with the building letter style the letter style to be used on a sign should also be based on the architectural style of the building simple block letters are generally most compatible with the mexican style buildings more intricate lettering is generally appropriate for the wooden victorian style there are numerous styles of lettering that could be used including old english stencil cloister and quill script block lettering would also be appropriate for the victorian and early to middle 20th century buildings for those buildings more recently constructed and having no particular architectural style simpler letter styles are probably the most desirable lighting it must be recognized that illuminated signing is a development of the 20th century however it is recognized that illuminated signs have some advantage over some nonilluminated signs in identifying businesses at night generally illuminated signs are inappropriate except for businesses which normally operate in the evening hours for those cases where illumination is determined essential by the design review and historic preservation commission it shall be as subtle as possible whenever a sign is to abut a residential area the illumination times and location of the sign will be carefully considered exterior illumination illumination from concealed lights is the most appropriate means of illumination for most signs it is also the most preferable method of illumination for maintaining the historical integrity of the sign and the building such flood lights should not be excessive in brilliance and must be shielded flood lights must be concealed in some manner landscaping or a building feature is often used interior illumination interior illumination is generally most appropriate for smaller signs or signs a distance away from the plaza area within the plaza area large interior illuminated signs are not complementary to the character of most of the shops though smaller signs might be designed with careful attention to the other elements so that they would be harmonious with the area the less white or lightcolored surface there is on a sign the less glaring an illuminated sign will be darker colors will tone down the lighting of a sign considerably illumination levels shall be kept to the minimum necessary to provide legibility at normal sight distances no interiorly illuminated sign is allowed in any residential zoning district placement proper placement of the sign basically depends on the movement of the possible customer traffic within the area and the type of business involved if the business is on an arterial street the sign will have to be obvious to fast moving vehicular traffic projecting or detached signs or more obvious wall signs are therefore appropriate if the business is in or on the fringes of a heavily traveled pedestrian area small projecting signs or flat wall signs are adequate to identify the business to the slower traffic which is probably giving their entire attention to the stores they are passing detached permanent signs are in most cases unnecessary and unattractive in pedestrianoriented areas it has been found that small sidewalk signs placed during business hours may add interest and direct foot traffic to shops  however specific guidelines have been established to prevent an excessive number of signs second story or multiple suites will be encouraged to share sidewalk sign space to eliminate congestion where a sidewalk sign already exists there will be as a general rule 18 feet between it and any adjacent sidewalk sign  however each case will be studied individually a judiciously placed projecting sign may offer better identification than a sidewalk sign in some locations placement of a sidewalk sign shall be as approved by the design review and historic preservation commission the placement of signs should also take into consideration the architectural style of the building for spanish style buildings flat wall signs very small projecting signs and low profile detached signs are in keeping with the historic feeling and aesthetic appearance of the building flat wall signs and smaller projecting signs as well as painted window signs are most appropriate for wooden victorian style buildings larger freestanding signs generally tend to fail to carry the historical continuity of sonoma and should be considered carefully before being proposed architectural treatment of the supporting mechanism of the signs can make them more compatible with the building involved and with the rest of the town this can be accomplished by mounting the sign in a planter covering the post with various building materials or using materials for the entire sign which have been suggested earlier as being complementary to the building involved roof signs are regulated stringently by this title placement of a sign on a roof interrupts the architectural lines of a building oftentimes making the building appear cluttered roof signs should be used only when the silhouette of the sign is not in conflict with the silhouette of the rooflines of the building the placement of any new sign or replacement of an existing sign shall not obstruct the visibility of an existing sign whenever it can be avoided logos symbols and pictures for certain types of businesses a logo or symbol is an integral part of identification such as the various oil company logos the mortar and pestle symbol for drug stores and the cocktail glass for an onsale liquor establishment for such businesses it will normally be appropriate for such symbols to be included in identification signs such symbols should be in proper scale considering the overall size of the sign and should be only supplementary to the total identification information of the sign other businesses may wish to use a symbol or picture as a means of identifying the nature of the business this might be done in a subtle manner according to the guidelines suggested for colors and materials it is suggested that only one logo or symbol be used for a single business and that in general the size of the logo symbol or picture be kept small         appendix b  city of sonoma lighting

objectives and a description of likely public improvements and other potential changes as follows 1existing conditions the discussion of existing conditions which opens each chapter is intended to briefly set forth the unique characteristics of each planning area in terms of natural and built features a primary purpose of this section is to provide a context for the regulations and guidelines that follow 2desired future this subsection contains a discussion of the general planning objectives for the area as derived from relevant general plan policies and the particular conditions of the planning area it is to be used by decisionmaking bodies including the city council the design review and historic preservation commission and the planning commission as a reference to the larger intent of specific development regulations and as guidelines in the review of discretionary development applications within each planning area 3potential changes in this subsection specific public improvements relevant to each planning area are described including street extensions new bicycle and pedestrian paths drainage improvements and street tree plantings also described are approved or anticipated private development projects of significance to the planning area projects and improvements are drawn from general plan policies and implementation measures the citys fiveyear capital improvement program other project objectives identified by the city council approved and anticipated development proposals and projects identified by other agencies eg the sonoma valley unified school

located at the eastern edge of the city between east napa street and east macarthur street and includes some of the oldest residential areas in the community with mature landscaping and street trees the streets primarily follow a grid pattern with variable widths supporting slower traffic some streets have sidewalks andor parkway landscaping strips and many homes have tall mature hedges along the front property line which create well defined street edges setbacks tend to be large but vary widely the area includes a variety of architectural styles representative of individual home subdivision and construction nathanson creek meanders from the northern boundary of the planning area along its west edge where it crosses east macarthur street the east edge of the planning area is adjacent to

design is to preserve the existing quality and fabric of residential neighborhoods in the centraleast planning area two key issues that could affect efforts to maintain the character of the area include a significant number of parcels that could be subdivided as infill lots and the site planning and building design techniques employed in their development development of the potential infill parcels will mainly need to focus on visual compatibility with the adjacent patterns of site design building scale and architectural context cpotential changes the future development of the parcels east of armstrong estates will lead to the extension of charles van damme way and william cunningham avenue and perhaps to the connection of appleton way with east napa street this area portions of

preserving the generally small scale of the older tracts and avoiding the overbuilding of lots the largest opportunity for new residential development is represented by the montini property a 14acre parcel located at the northwest corner of the planning area adjacent to the vallejo home state park its development should contribute to the character of the area by extending the grid pattern of the older residential blocks to the south while providing a greater variety of lot sizes and unit types as called for by its sonoma residential zoning designation new multifamily development along west

drive will be annexed to the city so that the residents of those areas may have the benefit of reliable water and sewer service however these areas are intended to be preserved as pockets of rural development new development within these areas and future public improvements should be consistent with that goal existing and planned singlefamily developments within the planning area will inevitably contrast with adjacent rural areas while the general character of development within these areas will be that of urban density singlefamily residential transitional design elements should be used especially at street connections between urban and rural areas the planned developments within the southwest area were designed with little room for change additions and renovations will be greatly restricted due to the small lot sizes and narrow setbacks associated with these developments cintended changes harrington drive and malet street west of first street west will require some level of upgrading but street sections should reflect and reinforce the rural qualities of those areas elsewhere in the planning area gaps in the sidewalk system need to be closed and in the long term sidewalks with planter strips will probably be extended along fifth street west and leveroni road except for a connection between newcomb street and malet street and possible improvements to the

only 59 acres its future development is crucial to the identity of sonoma it forms the southern entrance to the city and marks the division between the rural and agricultural character of the

for existing and future residential development in southern sonoma in terms of site planning architecture and landscaping new development and redevelopment should draw from the best examples of sonoma existing local serving uses within the district should be retained and encouraged to upgrade in keeping with the overall goals for the area the development of the gateway district will contrast with the rural and agricultural lands of the unincorporated territory to the south east and west design sensitivity will be needed to make this contrast pleasing rather than jarring larger setbacks and lower building heights are appropriate at the edge properties of the district with smaller setbacks and higher buildings at the core it is expected that the hotel at the northwest quadrant of the district will anchor other visitorserving uses and encourage the improvement of other properties in the area pedestrians must be better served  by extending sidewalks with planter strips along major roads by reducing driveway cuts and by requiring pedestrian pathways and connections in new development a street tree planting program should be developed and implemented in conjunction with frontage improvements cpotential changes in terms of road improvements the southernmost segment of broadway within the gateway district will ultimately be widened to three lanes napa and leveroni road may not

an area of approximately 89 acres all of which is owned by sonoma county and dedicated to use as a regional park the maxwell farms regional park encompasses a range of recreational uses including playing fields a boys and girls club and natural hiking areas the vallejo district is dominated by the 57acre vallejo home state park the historic buildings within this park are set off by expansive vistas north of the park are several large vacant parcels currently used for grazing but having a zoning of hillside residential other uses within the district include a complex of city buildings the police station and the city council chambers and playing fields a church and a small amount of residential development the third open space district is comprised of the mountain cemetery this

requiring discretionary approval and adaptive reuse projects cpreservation and rehabilitation of existing structures in general preservation and rehabilitation efforts should aim toward protecting the essential architectural features of a structure that help to identify its individual style and thereby further its contribution to the historic character of the surrounding neighborhood 1general rehabilitation principles ahistoric structures should be recognized for their own time and style rehabilitation should not try to create a preconceived concept of history but should reuse existing or appropriate features brehabilitation of historic structures should try to retain and restore original elements first if damage or deterioration is too severe the element should be recreated using original materials to match the color design texture and any other important design features cwhen replacement is necessary and original material cannot be obtained substitution material should incorporate the color design and texture that conveys the visual appearance of the original material 2doors aolder structures almost always had solid wood doors that fit the particular style of the structure the front door of the structure was the most ornate with secondary doors usually more utilitarian in appearance the shape size and style of doors are an important feature of all historical architectural styles and the original designtype should be maintained boriginal doors should be repaired in place whenever possible when replacement is necessary the replacement door should match the original design and materials as close as possible cif the original door is missing appropriate design and materials should be selected by studying the doors of similar structures in the surrounding neighborhood or consulting books on architectural styles many older style panel doors are still available from material suppliers and may match the original doors very closely 3exterior materials athe original exterior building materials should be retained whenever possible it is not desirable to use mismatched materials of different finishes shapes sizes or textures bstructures with original wood siding should not be stuccoed in an attempt to modernize their appearance likewise plastic shingles should not be used to replace wood siding or shingles creplacing wood siding with aluminum siding of the same shape and size as the original siding can be an alternative but care shall be taken to use siding of the appropriate size dbrick surfaces should not be sandblasted in an attempt to remove old paint sandblasting would damage the natural fired surface of the brick and cause it to lose its water repellent qualities also mechanical grinders should not be used to remove mortar as this can damage the brick surrounding the joint 4ornamentation and trim amost often it is the authentic decoration and trim on a structure that lends character and identifies the structure with its particular architectural style original ornamentation should be preserved whenever feasible bif the material needs to be removed to be repaired or copied determine how the piece is attached and carefully plan the work to be sensitive to the material any prying action should be slow and careful with a minimal amount of force cif the ornamentation or trim is comprised of several layers of materials it is helpful to sketch the components as they come apart to ensure proper reassembly if the pieces are beyond repair a skilled finish carpenter should duplicate the original work 5porches and stairs aduring rehabilitation efforts the design integrity of the front porch should not be compromised front porches should not be enclosed with walls or windows bif enclosing the porch is the only viable means of adding needed space care should be taken to use decorations doors siding materials trim details and windows that match the facade of the structure surrounding the porch 6roofs aroofs are important both functionally and aesthetically great care should be taken to ensure that roofs are watertight and that roofing materials are compatible with the original style of the structure oftentimes roofs only need repairs but when replacement is necessary roofing materials should be selected that are appropriate to the structures architectural style bit should be recognized that fire safety requirements may preclude reroofing a structure in its original material the determination of what material to use for the replacement of wood shingles or shakes in historic structures should be based on compatibility with the colors and materials used elsewhere on the structure 7windows amost olderhistoric structures had wood framed windows that were either casement double hung or fixed the shape size and style of windows are an important feature of most architectural styles and the original type window should be maintained bwhen window replacement is necessary it is preferred that the new window be an exact match of the original can alternative to special milling may be the use of an offtheshelf standard window that closely matches the original daluminum or plastic frame windows should not be used as replacements on any part of an historically valuable structure without justification the use of such materials is highly visible and the contrast of materials and styles can permanently affect the architectural integrity of the structure the use of traditional materials is preferred dadditions to existing structures additions to historically valuable structures may be necessary to ensure their continued use modifications eg additions new entrances and exits parking facilities handicap facilities and seismic strengthening should be made with care so as not to compromise a structures historically valuable features finishes or materials 1site plan considerations additions should be carefully placed to minimize changes in the appearance of the structure from the public rightofway whenever possible additions should be placed to the side or rear of the structure and should not obstruct the appearance of the structure from the public rightofway 2architectural compatibility aadditions to historically valuable structures should incorporate the distinctive architectural features of the original structures including idoor and window shape size and type  iiexterior materials  iiifinished floor height  ivroof material pitch and style  and vtrim and decoration brefer to the rehabilitation guidelines subsection c of this section preservation and rehabilitation of existing structures for discussion of appropriate exterior doors porches wall materials windows etc 3roof pitch and style athe roof of a structure especially its pitch and style is an important architectural element that should be taken into consideration when planning an addition bwhenever possible the pitch and style on the addition should match the original croof materials should also match as close as possible 4secondstory additions abecause adding an additional story to an existing structure will always change the structures proportions such additions should be carefully designed to follow similar twostory examples of the particular style that may be found in the surrounding neighborhood bintegrating the new secondstory addition into the original design of the structure may be easier if the addition is set back from the front facade so that it is less noticeable from the public rightofway a exh b 2013   formerly   guidelines for infill development apurpose these guidelines are intended to encourage new infill development in the historic overlay district to be compatible in scale and treatment with the existing older development and to maintain the overall historic character and integrity of the community at the same time these guidelines are intended to promote the visual variety that is characteristic of sonoma to allow for contemporary architectural designs and to provide reasonable flexibility in accommodating the tastes preferences and creativity of applicants proposing new development especially individual singlefamily homes as stated in the 2020 general plan sonoma should continue to be characterized by variety in terms of land uses building types and housing and this diversity should be consistent with preserving the towns smallscale and historic character bguidelines for compatibility the single most important issue of new infill development is one of compatibility especially when considering larger structures when new structures are developed adjacent to older singlefamily residences there are concerns that the bulk and height of the infill structures may have a negative impact on the adjoining smallerscale structures the following considerations are intended to address this concern 1site plan considerations anew development should continue the functional onsite relationships of the surrounding neighborhood for example common patterns that should be continued are entries facing the public rightofway front porches and garagesparking areas located at the rear of the parcel bfront setbacks for new infill development should follow either of the following criteria iequal to the average front setback of all residences on both sides of the street within 100 feet of the property lines of the new project  or iiequal to the average front setback of the two immediately adjoining structures on each side of the new project cin cases where averaging between two adjoining existing structures is chosen the new structure may be averaged in a stepping pattern this method can work especially well where it is desirable to provide a large front porch along a portion of the front facade 2architectural considerations anew infill structures should support the distinctive architectural characteristics of development in the surrounding neighborhood including building mass scale proportion decorationdetail door and window spacingrhythm exterior materials finishedfloor height porches and roof pitch and style bbecause new infill structures are likely to be taller than one story their bulk and height can impose on smallerscale adjoining structures the height of new structures should be considered within the context of their surroundings structures with greater height should consider providing greater setbacks at the secondstory level to reduce impacts eg blocking or screening of air and light privacy etc on adjoining singlestory structures cthe incorporation of balconies and porches is encouraged for both practical and aesthetic reasons these elements should be integrated to break up large front facades and add human scale to the structures dthe proper use of building materials can enhance desired neighborhood qualities eg compatibility continuity harmony etc the design of infill structures should incorporate an appropriate mixture of the predominant materials in the surrounding neighborhood whenever possible common materials are brick horizontal siding shingles stone stucco and wood ecolor schemes for infill structures should consider the color schemes of existing structures in the surrounding neighborhood in order to maintain compatibility and harmony avoid sharp contrasts with existing building colors 3singlefamily residences athe design of an individual singlefamily residence is typically of great significance to the homeowner changes required design review process should be the minimum necessary to achieve compatibility with the overall character of the historic overlay district bhistoric architectural styles eg craftsman victorian bungalow etc are not mandated however contemporary architectural treatments proposed for new residences should complement and not detract from the qualities of the historic overlay district and the neighborhood setting of the proposed development cto the extent that a proposed residence is not readily visible from a public street other public vantage point or a significant historic resource greater design flexibility should be allowed 4sustainable construction techniques abuilding forms that reduce energy use may be radically different than traditional architectural types careful and sensitive design is required in order to produce a contrast that is pleasing rather than jarring the use of appropriate colors and textures on exterior materials is one method of linking a contemporary building design to a traditional neighborhood context broof gardens solar panels and other sustainable construction features should be fully integrated into the design of new construction rather than applied at the conclusion of the design process 5accessory structures anew accessory structures eg garages second units sheds etc that are visible from the public rightofway should incorporate the distinctive architectural features eg color materials roof pitch and style etc of the main structure bdesign features should be applied with less detail on the accessory structure so that it does not compete with the main structure and is clearly subordinate to it a exh b 2013  exh b 2007   formerly
