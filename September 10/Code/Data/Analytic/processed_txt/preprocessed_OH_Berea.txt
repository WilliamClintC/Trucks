administrative three  streets utilities and public services five  business regulation seven  traffic nine  general offenses thirteen building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10   this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position   enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories

limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials further it is not the intent of this restrict or deny access by adults to sexuallyoriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment of their intended market neither is the intent nor effect of this condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material    b   findings the berea city council has received substantial evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on a community in findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 1986 475 us 41  young v american mini theatres 1976 426 us 50  and barnes v glen theatre inc 1991 501 us 560 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to seattle washington  phoenix arizona  st paul minnesota  minneapolis minnesota  tucson arizona  indianapolis indiana  beaumont texas  oklahoma city oklahoma  houston texas  brook park ohio and strongsville ohio the council finds 1adult entertainment businesses in the city lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2certain employees of adult entertainment businesses defined in this chapter engage in higher incident of certain types of sexuallyoriented behavior at these businesses than employees of other establishments 3sexual acts including masturbation oral and anal sex occur at adult entertainment businesses 4persons frequent certain adult entertainment businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex on the premises of such businesses 5at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult entertainment businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hiv genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 6since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states  600 in 1982  2200 in 1983  4600 in 1984  8555 in 1985  and 253448  7the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 8the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 9the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 10according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 11sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of such business to selfregulate the activities and maintain the facilities 12the findings noted in paragraphs b1 11 raise substantial government concerns 13adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial government concerns 14a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult entertainment business further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the adult entertainment business is run in a manner which is consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 15requiring licensees of adult entertainment businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 16the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the adult entertainment business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexuallytransmitted diseases 17it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 18the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment business license has been convicted of a sexuallyrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 19the barring of such individuals from the management of adult entertainment businesses in the city for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 20the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of berea will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter passed 4510 58102 definitions as used in this
