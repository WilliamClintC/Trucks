subdivision 1 upolicyu a it is in the public interest to protect against uncoordinated and unplanned land development which affects marshes swamps wetlands drainage ways lakes and watercourses within the city which development if allowed to continue will result in loss and damage to public and private improvements by flood waters and subsequent expensive construction of storm sewers and other public projects in the permanent destruction of these natural resources loss of water retention facilities open space and wildlife habitats and impairment of public and private water supplies the objectives of this section are to permit and encourage a coordinated land and water management program and the retention of open land uses which will locate permanent structures and artificial obstructions so as to not obstruct the passage of waters nor destroy the natural public water areas marshes and wetlands within the city the council has in mind its statutory obligation to adopt a flood plain ordinance pursuant to minnesota statutes chapter 103 the proposed regulations and model ordinances of the lake minnetonka conservation district and the particular watershed district the open space policies of the metropolitan council and its guidelines encouraging protection of marshes wetlands and the flood plain area and the public interest in preventing irreparable destruction of valuable natural resources as expressed by numerous persons b in addition to these general purposes the specific intent of this section is to 1 reduce danger to health by protecting surface and ground water supplies from the impairment which results from incompatible land uses by providing safe and sanitary drainage  2 reduce the financial burdens imposed both on this city and on communities within the watershed districts and the individuals therein by frequent floods and overflow of water on lands  3 permit and encourage planned development land uses which will not impede the flow of flood water or cause danger to life or property  4 permit and encourage land uses compatible with the preservation of the natural vegetation and marshes which minnetrista city v  planning and land use  of 301 are a principal factor in the maintenance of constant rates of water flow year and which sustain many species of wildlife and plant growth  5 avoid fast runoff of surface waters from developed areas to prevent pollutional materials such as animal feces motor oils paper sand salt and other debris garbage and foreign materials from being carried directly into the nearest natural stream lake or other public waters  6 encourage a suitable system of ponding areas to permit the temporary withholding of rapid water runoff which presently contributes to downstream flooding and general water pollution giving preference to areas which contribute to groundwater infiltration and recharge thereby reducing the need for public projects to contain store and control such runoff  7 provide sufficient land area to carry abnormal flows of storm water in periods of heavy precipitation and to prevent needless expenditures of public funds for storm sewers and flood protection devices which proper planning could have avoided  8 prevent the development of structures in areas unfit for human usage by reason of danger from flooding unsanitary conditions or other hazards  9 prevent the

by ridges and hills the 104acre lake is separated into two basins by a shallow area of cattail growth the northern basin contains a public access and an informal swimming area this basin consists only of about 45 acres of open water but is up to 73 feet deep the water quality and clarity is excellent and the environment is quite natural these physical characteristics have encouraged a variety of lowprofile uses such as canoeing swimming scuba diving and smallcraft fishing it is the citys intention to encourage the continued serenity and purity of the lake as well as its existing mixture of lowprofile uses the ridges and hills surrounding the basin create a natural amphitheater any sound within the basin is amplified therefore the existing quietude of canoes swimming scuba diving and small fishing craft will be negatively impacted by the loud noise associated with larger gasoline motors the speed associated with larger gasoline engines is unnecessary on a body of water the size of little long lake furthermore large boats and motors using the public access will likely conflict with the existing uses near the access both swimming and scuba diving occur within several hundred feet
