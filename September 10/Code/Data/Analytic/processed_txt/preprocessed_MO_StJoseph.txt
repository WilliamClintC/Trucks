joseph missouri hereby finds and declares that a the comprehensive plan for the city land use plan of the city of st joseph missouri adopted  and amended from time to time and census and population studies to date indicate that growth will continue throughout the upcoming years and will place additional demands on the city to provide transportation facilities to support new development c funds collected pursuant to the st joseph transportation user fee be expended only on transportation facilities and facility expansions within the transportation road user fee service area from which the property is located with respect to which the road user fee was paid d the transportation facilities and facility expansions constructed within each service area have a rational nexus to and provide a benefit to those properties with respect to which fees are imposed pursuant to this article e it is the intent of this article that by establishment of transportation user fees new development in the city will pay its fair share of the cost of transportation facilities and facility expansions required to serve such new development and that the fees paid with respect to each new development are based on an individualized determination roughly st joseph code 26205  cd proportionate both in nature and extent to the demand that such new development will have on transportation facilities f it is the intent of this article that the transportation facilities and expansions financed transportation impact fees established hereby be based when applicable upon the citys comprehensive plan major street plan and capital improvement program and are consistent therewith g the city council has considered the matter of financing of new transportation facilities and facility expansions the need for which is necessitated by new development the council hereby finds and declares that a transportation user fee imposed upon new development to finance city transportation facilities and facility expansions the need for which is reasonably related to the new development furthers the public health safety and welfare of st joseph therefore the city council deems it advisable to adopt the st joseph transportation user fee hereinafter set forth go 226 11408 intent a the st joseph transportation user fee intended to impose a users fee upon the approval of a final plat if a final plat must be approved prior to issuance of a building permit pursuant to the st joseph land development or to the issuance of a building permit if approval of a final plat is not so required in an amount based upon the demand for transportation facilities or facility expansions attributable to the new development and the cost of providing such facilities necessary to serve new development the user fee shall be payable upon issuance of a building permit this article shall not be construed to authorize imposition of fees for transportation facilities or facility expansions the need for which is attributable to existing development or pass  traffic b the intent of this article is to establish a system of users fees as users fees are interpreted in recent missouri case law that will be used to pay for the cost of providing transportation facilities and facility expansions the demand for which is generated by new development the amount of the users fee to be paid by each new development is calculated to be directly proportionate to the demand for transportation facilities and facility expansions created by each such new development this article is specifically designed so as not to establish a tax or fee as such terms are used in of the missouri constitution but rather as a mechanism to equitably shift the burden of the cost of such facilities and expansions from the existing general public which has already paid its fair share of the cost of the existing network of roads and roadways and the associated appurtenances and which will continue to pay for the cost of maintenance and repair of such existing roadways other than those derived from the system of users fees to new development that will generate the need for the transportation facilities and facility expansions that will be provided by monies derived from this system of users fees the monies collected from imposition of this system of users fees are to be used to offset the cost of providing services to new development in the form of transportation facilities and facility expansions and the system is designed to ensure that such monies collected may only be expended to provide such services the monies may not be paid into the citys general fund to defray customary governmental expenditures in addition the system is designed so that the users fee 1 is paid upon the approval of designated development applications not periodically  and 2 is required to be expended for the provision of transportation facilities that directly benefit the person who has generated the need for such facilities within a reasonable period of time from the date such fee is paid  and 3 is directly proportional in amount to the transportation services provided  and 4 is for a service that has not historically been provided exclusively by monies derived from taxes c towards this end the transportation user fee adopted pursuant to this article is based upon the calculation methodology described in the st joseph transportation facilities user fee report which report is hereby incorporated by subdivisions 26205  cd reference into this article as if fully included herein go 226 11408 authority

have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in of this article or the specific prohibitions in of this article if it can

an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were not feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c

to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelates steps as follows 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent change of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of
