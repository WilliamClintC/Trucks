div 4 was comprised of  3410134114 pertained to stormwater runoff and derived from adopted sept 19 2000 authority for ordinance this section is adopted by the village board of the village of mukwonago under the authority granted by wsa   920715 28133 and ch 236 the requirements of this section do not preempt more stringent erosion and sediment control requirements that may be imposed by any of the following a wisconsin department of natural resources administrative rules permits or approvals including those authorized under wsa  28116 and 28333 b targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated under rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under nr wis adm iv 1609  i 51716  i 41817 findings the village of mukwonago board finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff and construction site erosion from land development and land disturbing activity can have significant adverse impacts upon local water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled soil erosion and stormwater runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing stream bed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperatures  2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loadings of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants  3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and increasing pollutant loads  4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading  5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing runoff volumes and peak flood flows and overburdening storm sewers drainageways and other storm drainage systems  6 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  and 7 generate airborne particulate concentrations that are healththreatening or may cause other damage to property or the environment iv 1609 purpose and intent a the general purpose of this ordinance is to establish regulatory requirements for land development and land disturbing activities aimed to minimize the threats to public health safety welfare and the natural resources of the village of mukwonago from construction site erosion and postconstruction stormwater runoff specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  establish erosion control and stormwater standards for building sites placement of structures and land uses  and preserve ground cover and scenic beauty 3 control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger property b through a single stormwater permit process this ordinance is intended to meet the current construction site erosion control and postconstruction stormwater management regulatory requirements of subchapter iii of both nr 151 and nr 216 wis adm on the effective date of this ordinance nothing in this ordinance prevents the wisconsin department of natural resources from adopting or enforcing more stringent stormwater management requirements in future revisions of the wisconsin administrative c provisions have also been incorporated to coordinate the stormwater permit requirements of this ordinance with other village zoning and land division regulations d the village board recognizes that the preferred method of addressing postconstruction stormwater runoff from land development activities is preparation and implementation of regional stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds or subwatersheds accordingly provisions have been incorporated into this ordinance to allow for the implementation of a regional stormwater management plan in lieu of complying with certain onsite stormwater management requirements where such stormwater management plans have not been developed or approved by the village board it is the intent of the village board that the generic stormwater management standards set forth in this ordinance be applied unless otherwise recommended by the village engineer iv 1609 general administration the village of mukwonago engineer village administrator and zoning administrator are designated to administer and enforce

trees when planting bare root trees care must be taken to prevent unnecessary injury to roots all damaged roots should be pruned h tree selection 1 select the right tree for the right place a carefully review all aspects of the site 1 closely review the soils ability of moisture to drain soil 2 how much physical space is available above ground and below ground 3 dont plant a tree that will grow to a height of more than 30 feet under power lines 4 consider environmental factors such as exposure to the sun and road salt b choose a tree species which matches or is adaptable to the growing conditions you have found during the site analysis 2 select a healthy tree from a reputable nursery a avoid plants that have damaged twigs branches roots or trunk iatt 102114 tree planting procedures a to plant the trees properly 1 prepare the site by digging a hole at least three times the diameter and at least the depth of the root ball or the full extent of the root system of bare root trees leave a pedestal in the center of the hole to rest the root system on this should provide trees with enough worked earth for its root system to be established all banks of the hole shall be loosened by shovel and trees should be planted at their original soil level at the root collar 2 find the root collar and plant the tree even or one to two inches high it is recommended to remove burlap andor wire prior to planting 3 use good quality soil as backfill discard any rocks and debris from the soil before backfilling 4 water the soil with a garden hose do not pack the soil down manually  water will do this naturally fill in voids with more soil after watering new trees shall be watered as part of the planting process the day they are planted and then regularly for the first two years after planting utilizing techniques such as hose water spikes watering bags etc the goal is to ensure that newly planted trees receive the equivalent of 1 inch of rainfall per week 5 create a two to fourinch deep mulch bed using wood chips the mulch should not touch the trunk directly to prevent mold and bacteria from forming apply heavier at edges to create a saucer effect all newly planted trees shall be wood chip mulched and protected with at minimum 12 inch plastic boots 6 staking if you must stake use a wide beltlike material when supporting the tree to avoid injuring the bark trees need to move in the wind so allow some play in the support system to allow the trunk to sway without being uprooted 7 prune any broken dead or dying limbs without damaging the branch collar at the time of planting routine pruning should be started one year after planting do not use pruning paint or wound dressing on the pruning cuts 8 wait until one year after planting to fertilize b additional care pruning mulching and fertilizing should be provided as needed iatt 102114 maintenance and care of newly planted trees a fertilizing fertilization of planted trees in the first year is not recommended typically a tree can be fertilized once it has become established usually two or three years after planting only healthy established trees are to be fertilized fertilizing an established tree when growth is slow and vigor is low which is indicated by offcolor leaves or needles and by abnormal loss of foliage will place the stressed tree even deeper into stress stressed trees should be watered and otherwise left undisturbed until they recover fertilizer should be applied in the early spring before leaves appear a general purpose fertilizer containing nitrogen and potash is recommended b mulching a layer of wood chip mulch around the base of the tree will help conserve the soil moisture and help protect the tree and reduce competition from grass for nutrients the mulch should note piled around the trunk as the heat generated may damage the bark the mulch should be approximately four inches thick at the perimeter creating a saucer effect towards the trunk newly planted trees shall be wood chip mulched and protected with at minimum eight inch plastic boots c tree pruning no pruning should occur at the time of planting pruning at this time will reduce the amount of stored energy that the tree contains and could cause added stress to the tree during the second year a pruning schedule can begin d tree staking when staking use wide bands of nylon strap or innertubes to support the tree make sure that the tree has a small amount of room to move e watering newly planted trees require one inch ten gallons of water per week during the growing season to maintain health the property owner shall provide adequate moisture to trees the village should use local media to promote watering during dry periods new trees shall be watered as part of the planting

residency restrictions for sexual offenders and derived from i adopted sept 16 2014 findings and intent a the wisconsin legislature has provided for the punishment treatment and supervision of persons convicted or otherwise responsible for sex crimes against children including their release into the community indeed wsa ch 980 provides for the civil commitment of sexually violent persons the purpose of this article is to protect the public to reduce the likelihood that convicted sex offenders will engage in such conduct in the future the united states supreme court has recognized that the risk of recidivism posed by sex offenders is high and when convicted sex offenders reenter society they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault see smith v doe 538 us 84 123 sct 114 155 led 2d 164 2003 and mckune v lile 536 us 24 34 122 sct 201 153 led2d 47 2002 citing united states department of justice bureau of justice statistics

imposing restrictions on sex offenders with respect to residency  and in addition the united states court of appeals for the 8th circuit decision on doe v miller 405 f3d 700 716 8th cir 2005 providing in part the record does not support a conclusion that the iowa general assembly and the governor acted based merely on negative attitudes toward or fear of or a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group citations omitted sex offenders have a high rate of recidivism and the parties presented expert testimony that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense even experts in the field could not predict with confidence whether a particular sex offender will reoffend whether an offender convicted of an offense against a teenager will be among those who cross over to offend against a younger child or the degree to which regular proximity to a place where children are located enhances the risk of reoffense against children one expert in the district court opined that it is just common sense that limiting the frequency of contact between sex offenders and areas where children are located is likely to reduce the risk of an offense citations omitted the policymakers of iowa are entitled to employ such common sense and we are not persuaded that the means selected to pursue the states legitimate interest are without rational basis the board finds the negative consequences of failing to regulate the movement of sex offenders is a hazard to children and the community thus the village has a duty and need to regulate where sex offenders reside and loiter within the village once they are reintegrated into the community this chapter article is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of the children in the village from the risk that convicted sex offenders may reoffend in locations close to their residences it is the intent of this section not to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the villages compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the village by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing residence  and by regulating certain activities that may be used by sexual offenders to prey on children b the village finds and declares that sex offenders are a serious threat to public safety when convicted sex offenders reenter society they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault given the high rate of recidivism for sex offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places in addition to the protections afforded by state law near schools daycare centers and other places children frequent the village finds and declares that in addition to schools and daycare centers children congregate or play at public parks the board notes that wsa  6134 authorizes the village board to enact legislation for the health safety and welfare of the public in addition wsa  61345 notes that the powers rights and privileges accorded villages under said chapter are to be liberally construed in

development codes that are allowed process modifications to village development codes that are not allowed approval stages submittal requirements criterial for approval of a planned unit development overlay and other provisions to administer consideration and approval furthermore the village may provide additional guidelines to establish a planned unit development overlay 1 regulatory intent a planned unit development overlay district as defined under planned unit development in section 10029 is a regulatory process allowing modifications to a development plan to meet overall community land use goals and density criteria without being bound by exact development standards of an individual zoning district the process provides a flexible regulatory framework designed to allow developers greater freedom imagination and flexibility in the development of land while ensuring substantial compliance with the basic intent of the comprehensive plan and zoning code in the village of mukwonago a planned unit development is an overlay district approved as a conditional use which does not appear on the municipal zoning map until a planned unit development overlay district is approved for the development site 2 standards and criteria established each planned unit development overlay district is approved as a conditional use planned unit developments as defined in section 10029 are substantially different in character from other conditional uses and for this reason specific standards and criteria are hereby established to regulate each planned unit development overlay district the following describe general standards and criteria in the use and approval of a planned unit development overlay district a a minimum property size of two acres is required for a property owner to request a planned unit development overlay district b at time of approval a planned unit development overlay district shall be in a unified ownership either in a single property or a grouping of properties in the unified ownership nothing in the planned unit development overlay district approval shall prevent future land division or sale of all or portions of the development such as

district approved as a business mixed use overlay district or a village center overlay zoning district shall conform to the standards of that specific overlay district as outlined in this chapter 100 e all zoning districts allowed in this chapter may be utilized as underlying base zoning district or districts in a planned unit development overlay district except for residential districts that permit single family development f approval by the village board with recommendation from the plan commission shall include a detailed list of allowed modifications from zoning and other village municipal along with a detailed list of approved development plans each planned unit development shall be further regulated by a developers agreement 3 prior approved planned unit developments the village of mukwonago has allowed prior planned unit developments in specific zoning districts with a specific set of criteria while planned unit development approval via the prior criteria is no longer an option within this chapter 100  nonetheless developments approved pursuant to prior criteria remain in good standing if conforming to the plans and standards approved for each specific planned unit development any requested change in the approved plans or standards shall be amended process of section 10053 4 modifications allowed to create a unified development that is economically
