structures in the central business district will be two stories a minimum of 24 feet maximum building height will be determined according to the context transition edge map the height zone map the height zone edge setback and shadow impacts described below and with maps following this section a the twostory requirement for new construction will mean that 1 a second floor is provided as a full occupiable floor and a mezzanine level will not be sufficient to meet this requirement  and 2 civic uses such as places of worship arenas auditoriums and performance centers will not be required to meet the twostory requirement described in subsection 1 above b context transition edge the first step in determining the height permitted for a structure is to review the context transition edge map found at the end of this section to determine if it is applicable to the specific property this map shows areas where a gradual scale transition is required for new downtown construction from nearby established residential neighborhoods the map reflects a specific height overlay for properties located near the context transition edge a 100footwide area measured from the transition line buildings located within this transition edge will have their actual height determined by using the formula for height h   d15  where h is the height of the building and d is the distance from the transition edge the one exception is that a twostory structure with a 15foot setback when adjacent to residentially zoned property is exempt from the formula requirements c height zones measurement of height the second step in determining the height permitted for a structure is to review the building height zone map located at the end of this section 1 the intermediate height zone is 145 feet and the tallest height zone is 265 feet 2 actual building heights may exceed this height by an additional overall amount of 50 feet to accommodate such uses as the final occupied floor mechanical penthouses and roof cap features d height zone edge setback from the rightofway to protect certain views in downtown as illustrated on the height zone map by a dashed line specific to portions of four streets listed below a height zone edge setback is established the height zones for the intermediate height zone and the tallest height zone follow property lines except for the following streets where a height transition between these two zones 40 feet wide measured from the rightofway line edge will be observed 1 college street between the tunnel and town mountain road 2 haywood street between battery park

this elevation on the faade a stepback across the front or sides will be provided and in limited circumstances described below other alternatives may apply to ensure variety in new construction 1 street wall height the street wall height and specific alternatives are established in the following ways a if the property is located within the traditional downtown core area as illustrated on the map following this section the street wall will be set at between two and four stories with a recommendation to reflect the height of neighboring buildings  b if the property is located outside the traditional downtown core the street wall will be established by a onetoone relationship to the width of the rightofway row for example a row of 50 feet would result in a maximum street wall height of 50 feet depending on the site the following scenarios may apply 1 if a parcel fronts on more than one street the street wall shall be established by a the row width of the key pedestrian street if applicable  or b measuring the row from the side of the building with the primary pedestrian entrance 2 the street wall may wrap around to the sides at the same height or be reestablished based on the row of the side street for the purposes of this section frontage on a service alley will be treated the same as an internal property line and therefore would not require a street wall stepback or  c throughout the cbd a building that provides a setback along the frontage line to create a plaza or courtyard area minimum depth ten feet will not be required to establish a street wall this setback area must exceed twothirds of the building width along the frontage line  or d for areas outside the traditional downtown core where the row area is greater than 75 feet a building is not required to provide a street wall stepback or side stepback buildings in these situations will be required to meet other design and operational standards as applicable  or e throughout the cbd a variance may be sought as set forth in section 7591 from the stepback requirements by meeting design guidelines that specify a clear visual demarcation provided between the base of the building and upper floors corresponding to the height of the street wall the requested variance shall not result in conflict with building code requirements  or f throughout the cbd buildings determined to be signature buildings or proposed for landmark locations may seek a variance as set forth in section 7591 from street wall and stepback requirements when they meet design guidelines specific to landmarks see the public view corridors map for recommended landmark locations g when an existing onestory building that is a contributing structure in the downtown national register district will be incorporated into a development proposal that may include a single or multistory addition it will be deemed to satisfy the requirement or that portion of the requirement for the streetwall 2 stepback requirement in

haywood road form district 10 general provisions 11 purpose the purpose of the haywood road form district is to implement the haywood road corridor charrette report and the haywood road vision plan 12 intent it is the intent of this haywood road form district to 1 where feasible preserve and enhance existing buildings and structures along the corridor 2 ensure a high quality of development for new construction  3 reduce the bulk and mass of buildings  4 ensure adequate distribution of height and mass throughout the corridor with larger buildings located closer to patton avenue  5 allow for a mix of uses at a variety of scales  6 promote additional housing types and housing opportunities  7 make the corridor more walkable and pedestrianfriendly  8 implement the complete streets model by enhancing multimodal transportation options including transit bicycle and pedestrian connections  9 calm traffic and improve vehicular circulation  10 support existing businesses  and 11 ensure adequate transitions from the corridor to adjacent residential neighborhoods 13 applicability a territorial application the haywood road form district applies to all property located within the haywood road corridor as shown in subsection 21 b application of chapter 7 development 1 the following requirements of chapter 7 do not apply in the haywood road form district unless expressly stated

road form district is subject to all other regulations as well as the haywood road form district whether or not such other provisions are specifically referenced in the haywood road form district references to other regulations or provisions of the haywood road form district are for the convenience of the reader the lack of a crossreference does not exempt a land building structure or use from other regulations 3 it will be unlikely that a single developer will be able to implement the street cross section details found within each district pertaining to road width bike lanes and streetscape details for the corridor without more control of the roadway by the city of asheville minimal sidewalk and street tree requirements will be reviewed for compliance as a part of project submittals 4 overhead power lines along the corridor may not permit a building within close proximity to an easement area associated with the lines  if subject to these imposed restrictions which may overlap the property line buildings may measure their setbacks from the line of the easement and not the edge of the right of way c conflicting provisions 1 interpretation of conflicts between the

impervious surface standards none 7 height standards for the definition of height see building height in section 725 of this chapter the minimum height for new structures in the central business district will be two stories a minimum of 24 feet maximum building height will be determined according to the context transition edge map the height zone map the height zone edge setback and shadow impacts described below and with maps following this section a the twostory requirement for new construction will mean that 1 a second floor is provided as a full occupiable floor and a mezzanine level will not be sufficient to meet this requirement  and 2 civic uses such as places of worship arenas auditoriums and performance centers will not be required to meet the twostory requirement described in subsection 1 above b context transition edge the first step in determining the height permitted for a structure is to review the context transition edge map found in 7818 to determine if it is applicable to the specific property this map shows areas where a gradual scale transition is required for new downtown construction from nearby established residential neighborhoods the map reflects a specific height overlay for properties located near the context transition edge a 100footwide area measured from the transition line buildings located within this transition edge will have their actual height determined by using the formula for height h   d15  where h is the height of the building and d is the distance from the transition edge the one exception is that a twostory structure with a 15foot setback when adjacent to residentially zoned property is exempt from the formula requirements c height zones  measurement of height the second step in determining the height permitted for a structure is to review the building height zone map located in section 7818 of this chapter 1 the intermediate height zone is 145 feet and the tallest height zone is 265 feet 2 actual building heights may exceed this height by an additional overall amount of 50 feet to accommodate such uses as the final occupied floor mechanical penthouses and roof cap features d height zone edge setback from the rightofway to protect certain views in downtown as illustrated on the height zone map by a dashed line specific to portions of four streets listed below a height zone edge setback is established the height zones for the intermediate height zone and the tallest height zone follow property lines except for the following streets where a height transition between these two zones 40 feet wide measured from the rightofway line edge will be observed 1 college street between the tunnel and town mountain road 2 haywood street between battery park avenue and n french broad avenue south side 3 patton avenue from pearl street to otis street both sides of street and continuing from otis street to the point of pritchard park south side 4 hilliard avenue between clingman avenue and

operational standards new development proposals within the cbdcz district will be evaluated for their ability to meet the following standards within the underlying cbd district a street wall and stepback requirements in order to enhance the traditional scale of downtown and ensure adequate air and light at the sidewalk level and neighboring properties a visual demarcation will be established across the faade of the building at a height that is defined as the street wall corresponding to this elevation on the faade a stepback across the front or sides will be provided and in limited circumstances described below other alternatives may apply to ensure variety in new construction 1 street wall height the street wall height and specific alternatives are established in the following ways a if the property is located within the traditional downtown core area as illustrated on the map following this section the street wall will be set at between two and four stories with a recommendation to reflect the height of neighboring buildings  b if the property is located outside the traditional downtown core the street wall will be established by a onetoone relationship to the width of the rightofway row for example a row of 50 feet would result in a maximum street wall height of 50 feet depending on the site the following scenarios may apply 1 if a parcel fronts on more than one street the street wall shall be established by a the row width of the key pedestrian street if applicable  or b measuring the row from the side of the building with the primary pedestrian entrance 2 the street wall may wrap around to the sides at the same height or be reestablished based on the row of the side street for the purposes of this section frontage on a service alley will be treated the same as an internal property line and therefore would not require a street wall stepback or  c throughout the cbd a building that provides a setback along the frontage line to create a plaza or courtyard area minimum depth ten feet will not be required to establish a street wall this setback area must exceed twothirds of the building width along the frontage line  or d for areas outside the traditional downtown core where the row area is greater than 75 feet a building is not required to provide a street wall stepback or side stepback buildings in these situations will be required to meet other design and operational standards as applicable  or e throughout the cbd a proposal may be approved for a special condition from the stepback requirements by meeting design

historic character of charlotte street by helping to ensure that new buildings are architecturally compatible with the historic character of the street and that design characteristics are employed which are consistent with the historic architectural vocabulary of the area these characteristics include historic building forms and silhouettes proportions treatments exterior materials massing andor architectural style additionally it is intended that the front elevations and overall massing of new buildings be pedestrian scaled and related to the street it is not the intent that new buildings mimic historic designs but rather that they combine elements from the historic design palette in new ways to achieve a design which is compatible with and complementary to the historic character of the street in general the predominant historic style of architecture within the boundaries of the overlay district is of a residential form with pitched roofs porches and paned windows and is less urban than the structures south of e chestnut street to a lesser degree brick historic commercial structures exist in the corridor and these have pitched roofs and sometimes use a combination of brick and stucco when developing designs for new buildings it is advisable to reference existing historic buildings or other documentation to identify elements that are to be used in

into increments similar to historic faade widths found within the boundaries of the overlay district 5 use building materials that are similar to those used historically these include pebbledash or roughcast stucco wood shingles and horizontal wood siding for buildings which are residential in character brick was typically used for original historic commercial structures sometimes in combination with stucco above or as a foundation material for structures which are residential in character stone was also used to a lesser degree as a material at the foundation or first floor level with shingles or stucco above 6 a minimum of 40 percent of the first floor and 20 percent of the upper floors on the front faade shall have windowdoor fenestration windows shall be set to the inside of the

front and corner side setbacks established for particular zoning districts require modification in order to create a more practical use of land in response to environmental or topographic considerations or to promote consistency with existing or proposed patterns of development the intent of this section is to provide for an administrative reduction in required front and corner side setbacks for entire residential subdivisions and in portions of residential subdivisions in routine circumstances where conditions warrant and a variance would be justified such conditions include but are not limited to the protection of significant existing vegetation  accommodation of trails and greenways  provision of a more usable lot arrangement due to topographical circumstances  and maintenance of consistent appearance within the subdivision or with similarly situated property in the vicinity of the subdivision it is not the intent of this section to simply provide a means to

protection standards flood protection a authority purpose objectives findings 1 authority this section is adopted pursuant to of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes 2 purpose it is the purpose of this section to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation and restrain of floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 3 objectives the objectives of this section are to a protect human life safety and health  minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in floodprone areas  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  c minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  ensure that potential buyers are aware that property is in a special flood hazard area  d help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood damage 4 findings a the floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of the city of asheville city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage b general provisions 1 applicability this section shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the citys territorial and extraterritorial jurisdiction 2 effect upon outstanding floodplain development permits nothing herein contained shall require any change in the plans construction size or

in advising motorists cyclists and pedestrians of road conditions traffic safety information the identification and location of businesses and other destinations among other things a proliferation of unregulated signage near or within the traveled rightofway can result in visual clutter leading to driver confusion and distraction 2 this public safety concern necessitates a careful balancing of

preservation of public safety by enacting the sign regulations contained in article 7 of the city 4 snipe signs as defined herein are temporary in nature inexpensive and easily and quickly placed in the public view in recent years the city has experienced a proliferation of snipe signs within or near the rightofway of public streets and roads especially in commercial areas which has greatly increased visual clutter along roadways and threatened traffic safety 5 snipe signs are also detrimental to the public health and safety in that they result in litter obstructions and hazards within
