from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas  encourage the location of towers on municipally owned property where appropriate or in other nonresidential areas  minimize the total number of towers throughout the community  strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse towers  encourage the use of existing buildings telecommunications towers light or utility poles or water towers as opposed to construction of new telecommunications towers  encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal  ensure that all telecommunications facilities including towers antennas and ancillary facilities are located and designed to minimize the visual impact on the immediate surroundings and throughout the community by encouraging users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly effectively and efficiently  consider the public health and safety of telecommunications towers  and avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
