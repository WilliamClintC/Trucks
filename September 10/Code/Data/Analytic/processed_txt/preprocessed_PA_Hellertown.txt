described in  3782 of this chapter by provisions designed to a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation changes the natural hydrologic patterns destroys aquatic habitat elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream

the peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required release rate at the point of discharge n capacity improvements 1 in certain instances primarily within the conditional nodetention areas local drainage conditions may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection of the entire watershed in these instances if the developer could prove
