wireless communications facilities and services a purpose and intent it is the general purpose and intent of the village to carry out the will of the united states congress by authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems it is the further purpose and intent of the village of beverly hills to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large in fashioning and administering the provisions of this section an attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless communication services and coverage it is the further purpose and intent of this  allow the village council of the village of beverly hills to regulate and restrict wireless communication facilities and services as principal permitted accessory permitted special approval or prohibited land uses 2 allow the village council to establish predetermined zone districts of the number shape and in the location for the establishment of wireless communication facilities subject to applicable standards and conditions 3 recognize that operation of a wireless communication system may in the opinion of the applicant require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined zone districts in such cases it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the community consequently more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review approval and use of such facilities 4 ensure that wireless communication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and relationships to other land uses structures and buildings 5 limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impact upon existing population transportation systems and other public services and facility needs 6 promote the public health safety and welfare 7 provide for adequate information about plans for wireless communication facilities in order to permit the community to effectively plan for the location of such facilities 8 minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities including a

sites and buildings natural beauty areas and public rightsofway this contemplates the establishment of as few structures as reasonably feasible and the use of structures which are designed for compatibility including the use of existing structures and the avoidance of lattice structures that are unnecessary taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this section 10 facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless communication facilities 11 the village council of beverly hills finds that the presence of numerous tower structures particularly if located within residential areas would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the community this in turn would have an adverse impact upon property values therefore it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall tower structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public health safety and welfare b definitions for the purposes of this the following definitions shall apply 1 attached wireless communications facilities antenna wireless communication facilities that are affixed

colocation it is the policy of the village of beverly hills to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures within the community and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facility purposes consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set forth in of this above each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must by law be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the united states congress however particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the village that all users should colocate on attached wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section as stated above and as stated in if a provider fails or refuses to permit colocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it where colocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy intent and purpose of the village of beverly hills the provisions of this designed to carry out and encourage conformity with this policy 1 feasibility of colocation colocation shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section where all of the following are met a the wireless communication provider entity under consideration for colocation will provide fair compensation for colocation b the site on which colocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility is able to provide structural support c the colocation being considered is technologically feasible eg the colocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure antennas and the like d the height of the structure necessary for colocation shall not exceed the maximum height identified under above 2 requirements for colocation a a special land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible colocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs b all new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate colocation c the policy of the community is for colocation thus if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible colocation such facility shall be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect d if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible colocation and this requires the construction andor use of a new facility the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible colocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy intent and purpose of the village of beverly hills and consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communication support structure within the village of beverly hills for a period of 5 years from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the colocation such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which in this context shall mean a

the village center design specifications which includes the set of streetscaping and public elements that will be required in the district to provide cohesive streets sidewalks and design within the village center to implement the village center plan the village has adopted a formbased code this is called the village center overlay district and is included in the village zoning this is the regulatory document that implements the village center plan the code refers to the village center plan which provides the foundation for the code and can be the basis for necessary elements which may not be required in the code per se but that may be necessary to achieving the vision in the village center plan to encourage use of the overlay district it contains additional regulatory flexibility and incentives such as additional building height and parking reductions to help improve development potential and viability in the village center {  1414} 2224 area height bulk and placement
