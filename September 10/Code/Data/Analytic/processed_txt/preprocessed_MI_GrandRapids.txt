the land or any materials stored or used on it are in greater danger of theft or damage or members of the public are at greater risk for harm than on other property  and c the deviations do not have a significant adverse effect on neighboring areas j administrative departure an administrative departure from the requirements this be granted if it is determined that proposed lighting otherwise meets the purposes of this does not adversely affect the health safety and welfare of the public infrastructure and service needs a purpose and intent 1 the purpose of this to permit development projects the ability to proceed at a faster pace than current city resources are capable of constructing installing modifying or improving existing infrastructure andor service capacities to accommodate the development project the project may itself be the sole reason for the infrastructure and service needs or it may contribute to a heightened demand for infrastructure and services which are nearing or already at capacity inadequately sized infrastructure or insufficient service to the development project would result in one 1 or more declining levels of traffic safety roadway capacity reduced level of service los or water sewer energy communications or other utility service reductions in the system it is the intent of this allow for development while ensuring that the project site and all customers that use and rely upon sufficient infrastructure and services within the community are properly accommodated 2 the inability of the city to provide or enhance the available level of infrastructure or services to accommodate the development project may serve as the basis to deny a project request due to insufficient or increasingly insufficient infrastructure capacity if the project were to be constructed project denial due to insufficient infrastructure or services is not a desired outcome as development and redevelopment projects often improve neighborhoods and over the longterm improve the economic capacity of the neighborhood and the community by raising property values and employment opportunities alternatives to improve infrastructure andor service insufficiency are preferable to project denial in these cases the city may offer an alternative to project denial by accepting the offer of voluntary support by the projects owners to undertake or contribute towards the cost of providing the needed infrastructure or service changes for future conditions created or contributed to as a result of the development project 3 in general infrastructure or service changes are quantifiable in terms of capacity and cost needed changes may require study planning design phasing or other efforts before being undertaken in these situations the city commission could by contract with the projects owners accept contributions to fund the work the city would set aside the funds for use only to address the particular infrastructure andor service changes associated with the development project for example in the situation where area streets and intersections are or will be functioning at low levels undertaking or funding street and intersection improvements may be appropriate sometimes however street and intersection improvements may not be practical or may be insufficient to address the concerns due to topography the impracticality of acquiring needed additional rightofway areawide traffic patterns jurisdictional issues or other limitations different approaches such as additional transit services remote parking lots pedestrian overpasses shared parking structures reversible traffic flows at peak times or other less common and more cooperative approaches may be the only feasible and reasonable alternatives to ameliorate anticipated infrastructure and service burdens imposed by the development upon customers and citizens within the service area a particular project may provide the necessary impetus for these alternative approaches particularly in relation to public health and safety while itself providing insufficient support or justification however together with reasonably foreseeable additional projects it may form the basis for addressing the need by these approaches b existing and future conditions evaluation the applicant or property owner shall be informed of any inadequately sized infrastructure or insufficient services within the proposed project area that currently exists or that will be created or contributed to by the proposed development project the director traffic engineering director planning commission or city commission will provide a basis for the determination that a development project either by itself or in conjunction with other reasonably foreseeable projects will 1 overload infrastructure or municipal services  2 measurably degrade the level of infrastructure or public services to levels that adversely affect public health safety or quality of life  or 3 place additional strains on infrastructure or public services that already are at levels that adversely affect public health safety or quality of life c alternatives evaluation the director may encourage the applicant to propose particular designs or improvements cost estimates and other related information to recommend or identify changes on the project site in the immediate project area or in locations which would assist in supporting the necessary infrastructure or services to sustain the development where the director does not have specific information about needed changes readily available because they are not easily ascertainable given the characteristics of the situation the director may identify possible ways and anticipated costs of addressing the conditions d determination upon review of the alternatives to support the needed infrastructure andor services to support the development project the applicant may 1 appeal a determination made by the director to the planning commission 2 discontinue the project 3 redesign the project to address the concerns 4 if it is acceptable to all city and other governmental officials of competent jurisdiction agree to a undertake and construct the needed infrastructure improvements according to plans and specifications approved and overseen by the city  b fund the needed infrastructure or service improvements pursuant to a written agreement approved by the city commission with the amount of the payment determined based on the actual costs of the improvements  c contribute to a fund to be used by the city to address the infrastructure or service concerns pursuant to a written agreement approved by the city commission with the amount of that contribution determined based on what the city commission reasonably determines to be the applicants proportionate share of the reasonably anticipated costs of the improvements satellite dish antennas a roofmounted satellite dish antennas the following roofmounted satellite dish antennas and similar devices shall not be subject to the requirements of this in residential zone districts a device that is two 2 meters or 67 feet or less in diameter 2 in

transitional features 1 purpose transitional features are architectural elements site features and alterations to building massing that are used to provide a transition between higher intensity uses and low or moderatedensity residential uses these features assist in mitigating potential conflicts between those uses in lieu of conventional landscape buffers or large setbacks it is the intent of these standards to a reduce land consumption  b create a compatible mixeduse environment  c limit interruptions in vehicular and pedestrian connections created by efforts to segregate densities and uses  and d establish or maintain vibrant pedestrian and transitoriented areas where differing uses and densities can operate in close proximity to one another 2 applicability transitional features shall be required in the following circumstances a where buildings or structures would be one 1 or more stories higher than adjacent residential buildings or structures b where nonresidential uses are situated adjacent to residential buildings or structures c where higherintensity land uses that would adversely affect the livability of an area d as a condition of any zoning approval required by when necessary to ensure that the appropriate review standards are satisfied 3 transitional features the following transitional features may be required either singly or in combination a landscape buffer the director or approving body for a required zoning approval as applicable may require the use of a landscape buffer  in lieu of or in addition to a transitional feature where such landscape buffer would be sufficient to reduce potentially adverse impacts between incompatible uses densities or different building types b uses a continuum of use intensity where moderate intensity uses are sited between highintensity uses and lowintensity uses may be required for multibuilding developments on one 1 or more lots an example would be a duplex between a singlefamily home and an apartment building c height and massing building height and massing shall be reduced in the form of building stepbacks recess lines or other techniques so that large structures are compatible in scale with smaller adjacent structures d architectural features similarly sized and patterned architectural features such as windows doors arcades pilasters cornices wall offsets building materials and other

be located away from a lowerintensity use  102318   32619 article 6  mixeduse commercial zone districts purpose and intent a mixeduse commercial districts are intended to accommodate commercial and highdensity residential uses that are compatible with the character of existing neighborhoods as defined development character of the master plan the preservation and reuse of existing buildings construction of new buildings on underutilized sites and the continuation of a compact development pattern as reflected in the master plan are key objectives for these zone districts b there are three types of mixeduse commercial districts city center linear and core 1 city center city center acknowledges downtown grand rapids as the business and cultural heart of the metropolitan region a dense development pattern focused on the close proximity of services a diversity of uses and dynamic building styles characterize this zone district the compatibility of more intense development with surrounding neighborhoods is emphasized use of a transitional zone district 2 linear commercial areas linear commercial areas may pass neighborhood classifications and front on a major street as defined by the city of grand rapids street classification policy the scale of new development and the transportation orientation of these zone districts are important factors in establishing the use and building element requirements of this core commercial areas core commercial areas are primarily focused around particular intersections with defined edges that abut less intense uses transitoriented development zone districts are focused on creating viable areas for transit and transit stations the scale and intensity of those core areas however varies depending upon the neighborhood classification the available land area proximity of established residential neighborhoods and street capacity rezoning requests to a transitoriented development require the installation of a qualifying transit station as described in b3e c placemaking 1 placemaking is the practice of creating conditions where people can live socialize play and shop in welldesigned comfortable places important placemaking elements in each of the zone districts are provided to inform zoning requirements and guide development decisions to achieve specific placemaking objectives these elements are intended to work in concert to ensure the creation of attractive and affordable residential areas protect existing neighborhood and historic character and resources allow an appropriate mix of uses that improves economic vitality and improve the health and wellbeing of grand rapids residents 2 to promote placemaking buildings and places should have a range of highquality residential commercial mixeduse and civic architectural styles to reinforce the unique identities of each part neighborhood and zone district in general buildings should contribute to placemaking by a being easily convertible spaces that allow for uses to change over time  b having residential uses with a variety of housing types sizes and price levels  c creating the potential for a broad mix of shops offices and housing integrated within and among a variety of building types  and d ensuring that architecture reflects the citys commitment to high quality and enduring character traditional neighborhood

institutional campus district is established to account for larger campuslike settings including colleges and universities hospital campuses senior living facilities and similar institutional arrangements mixed land uses may occur in the same building eg retail on ground floor office space above or in different buildings sited on the same lot or parcel eg freestanding child day care center located on the same parcel as an office building active uses such as retail restaurants cultural and public spaces are encouraged on the ground floor abutting a public street in certain circumstances less intensely developed areas that are characterized by single uses rather than a mix of uses may be developed 2 mixeduse environment the following requirements are intended to deal with the complexities inherent in campus settings and the establishment of a mixeduse environment that services the institutional use as well as the broader community the master plan promotes the restructuring of many of the citys existing institutional areas into compact walkable mixeduse centers the master plan advocates incorporating housing shopping jobs and services and providing attractive alternatives to travel by car it is understood that institutional settings involve density and character of living education working visiting and other arrangements that present unique challenges especially given that in some settings there are special physical mobility and equipment needs as well as unique situations in dealing with persons in various life stages sometimes dealing with particular health and emotional issues 3 design issues these regulations guide the physical form of the development project to resolve concerns and address design issues that might occur with the

these areas by adding special considerations in addition to those of the base zone district in all cases applicants for building permits in an overlay district shall meet both the requirements of the base zone district and the additional provisions requirements and restrictions of the overlay district 3 where there is conflict between other provisions of this those specifically applied in the overlay district shall control where there is conflict between other provisions of this those specifically applied in the overlay district shall control except as may be provided in  the overlay

districts od abbreviation zone district od  dh downtown height  od  gr grand river  od  ebl east beltline  od  fp floodplain  odws wayfinding signs  downtown height overlay district oddh a purpose 1 the purpose of the downtown height overlay district oddh is to allow a variety of building heights in the areas within and surrounding what is generally recognized as grand rapids downtown in addition certain qualifying development incentives are provided in recognition of the need to provide for a suitable mix of residential retail employment centers and urban open space that is essential for the creation of an attractive pedestrianfriendly vibrant and economically sustainable central business district 2 in addition these incentives promote an environment that enhances property values contributes to quality of life and sustains the downtown as a regional asset to this end the downtown height overlay district provides for certain incentives that permit building heights above the permitted base building heights to encourage certain development characteristics the city has deemed of value in creating highly livable walkable and vibrant environments 3 the district is further intended to recognize the need to have varying intensities of development from the densest levels of development in the city core to the edges of commercial area that begin to transition into less intensely developed areas and residential neighborhoods to this end the district establishes certain subareas to account for height and incentive differences b applicability map a of the zoning map depicts the boundaries of the area covered by the downtown height overlay district and its subareas the height requirements of the height overlay district are in addition to the requirements of the zone district in which an individual property is located all other applicable requirements of each district remain in effect c downtown height overlay subareas 1 the height overlay district establishes two 2 subareas as noted in table d each of which has height regulations applied additional bonus height provisions are available for properties that fall within both the height overlay district subarea and the grand river overlay district of  purposes a series of density incentives provided in building height are provided to help describe a smooth transition from the most intensively developed core of the downtown to the residential neighborhoods with a transition that steps down building heights from the core to these neighborhoods a dh1 the purpose of this subarea is to permit the greatest intensity of land use to create a core of development density for a wide variety of uses that are mutually supportive and serve regional needs including hotels restaurants employment centers medical centers entertainment venues and others these uses are also intended to create an active vibrant core b dh2 this subarea largely surrounds the core and nearcore downtown areas including areas on the west side of the grand river with a number of cultural and institutional uses important to the city and region it is intended as a transitional area between the more intense development of dh1 and the edges of downtown and nearby neighborhoods while still relatively intensively developed the lower building heights provide transition from the core the subarea is divided into two zones dh2a and dh2b to help reinforce the transition of building heights d permitted height table d describes the minimum and maximum permitted heights for buildings within each

the individual users right to convey a message must be balanced against the publics right to be free of signs which unreasonably compete with one another distract drivers and pedestrians and create safety concerns and confusion these regulations are intended to balance the individual users desire to attract attention with the citizens right to be free of unreasonable distractions 3 this recognizes the unique value of residential signs as a means of exercising constitutional freedom of expression and accordingly provides liberally for the display of noncommercial messages in residential areas 4 it is recognized that sign regulations provide business with equal opportunity to attract the public and that uses that are substantially the same in character deserve similar treatment while recognizing that those with clearly unique circumstances may need to be regulated by other means to ensure that the purposes and intents of this met 5 the city recognizes constitutional rights to free expression as well as the need to provide directional information enable travel and navigation and promote commerce 6 the city also recognizes that excessive numbers and locations for signs can impair travel and navigation by overwhelming and confusing travelers too many signs can also overwhelm the senses impair sightlines and vistas create feelings of anxiety and dismay affect the tranquility of residential areas impair aesthetics and degrade the quality of a community 7 while these regulations allow for a variety of sign types and sizes they do not necessarily ensure every property owner or business owners desired level of visibility b the intent of this to 1 support the master plans themes of great neighborhoods vital business districts strong

or hindrance of vision  and that impede safe movement of pedestrians or safe ingress and egress from buildings or sites  4 protect aesthetic quality of neighborhoods by preventing visual clutter and protecting views  and to eliminate signs and sign structures on unused properties to prevent confusion and enhance traffic safety  5 ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech is protected  6 reduce conflict between private signs and public signs used for purposes of traffic safety identification of traffic controls and other governmental purposes  7 reinforce and support the desired character of each neighborhood classification and zone district in a manner that takes into consideration building scale and massing lot size building setbacks transparency street dimensions travel speed and pedestrian presence so that signs contribute to the streetscape and aid in creating a sense of place  8 allow for adequate and effective signs for identification and appropriate commercial speech and noncommercial speech and for the dissemination of public information including but not limited to public safety information and notification as may be required by law and 9

exchange program is to reduce the overall number of nonconforming offpremises signs facilitate redevelopment and reduce visual clutter in residential and neighborhood commercial areas by providing incentives for the voluntary removal of nonconforming offpremises signs while it is recognized that offpremises signs serve a valuable purpose in the community by providing an advertising venue for local businesses and institutions as well as a means to promote noncommercial speech a proliferation of these signs may contribute to a sense of visual clutter and blight offpremises signs can also deter the redevelopment of a parcel or limit the redevelopment potential of a site due to extended lease periods for nonconforming offpremises signs b accordingly it is in the best interest of the city to advance the economic welfare of the community by facilitating new investment and land development in accordance with the master plan and to remove any potential barriers that may hinder redevelopment opportunities within residential areas and neighborhood business districts c the regulations in this section identify certain high traffic volume corridors and locations within the city

provider shall not constitute a waiver of or otherwise adversely affect the following reserved rights 1 right to require franchise  of the 1963 michigan constitution and the city charter require that all public utilities obtain a franchise to conduct a local business within the city the applicability of this requirement to telecommunications providers may be challenged under dd of the michigan telecommunications act which purports to define telecommunications services as not constituting public utility services due to this and other legal and regulatory issues and to avoid the expense and delay of litigation that may be unnecessary the city hereby determines that telecommunications providers shall not be required at this time to obtain franchises for the transaction of local business within the city telecommunications providers shall be required to obtain and maintain a permit for access to and ongoing use of the public rightsofway and to otherwise comply with the terms of this a permit shall not constitute a franchise the city reserves the right to require telecommunications providers to obtain a franchise in the future to transact local business within the city 2 rights regarding takings claim certain cable or telecommunications providers have initiated or supported legal proceedings in which they contend that federal law grants them the right to physically occupy the rightsofway and other property of a municipality for the purpose of providing telecommunications service without compensating the municipality for the use or value of the property so occupied or the cost of acquiring and maintaining such property municipalities dispute that claim the city believes that if such a claim were sustained it would among other things constitute an unlawful taking by the united states in violation of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution the legal issues involved in such disputes have not been finally decided the city desires to act on applications for permits granting access to its public rightsofway at this time rather than wait for determination of these issues provided this can be done without waiver or loss of any rights of the city or a permittee therefore notwithstanding any other provision hereof a permittee is not precluded by this seeking relief from the fee provisions of any court or agency of competent jurisdiction if a permittee seeks such relief the city reserves the right to assert a takings claim and to take all action it deems necessary in support thereof neither this the issuance or acceptance of a permit hereunder constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either the city or the permittee in connection with these disputed issues and the acceptance of a permit constitutes an acknowledgment and agreement thereto by the permittee 3 option to obtain consent agreement the city finds that legislative legal and regulatory issues in connection with use of the public rightsofway by telecommunications providers and the resulting potential for litigation and delay are likely to have an adverse impact on the development of a healthy competitive telecommunications infrastructure in the community this would be detrimental to the city and its residents as well as to telecommunications providers the issues affect among other things both the cost to telecommunications providers and compensation to the city for the maintenance and use of its public rightsofway in order to promote certainty encourage competition and avoid litigation the city will at the request and sole option of an applicant or permittee consider entering into a consent agreement for use of the public rightsofway for the provision of telecommunications services on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the city and the telecommunications provider it is the citys intent that such an agreement would satisfy the requirement for a permit under this would include among other things a fee of up to five percent of the applicable gross revenues of the telecommunications provider which would include the permit fee  an extended term of up to 15 years  authorization to conduct a local business in the city pursuant to of the 1963 michigan constitution  and a covenant to abide by the terms of the agreement as a compromise of disputed issues and uncertain outcomes notwithstanding the resolution of these legislative regulatory and legal requirements in the future a permittee may request a consent agreement at any time
