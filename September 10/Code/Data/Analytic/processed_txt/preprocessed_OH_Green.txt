cardarelli clerk editors note the numbering system used in these codified ordinances is similar to that used in the ohio revised is consistent with general practice each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal the section number appears to the right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01 with this numbering system the codified ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly codes titles and chapters are initially evennumbered thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as in the revised are the traffic and general offenses codes where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter in each are included as part of the sections newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66006 and precede 66007 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior

the number of signs in the city is excessive and unduly distracting to motorists and pedestrians creates a traffic hazard and in some places reduces the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public as the appearance of the city is marred by the excessive number oversized and poorly designed signs both business and residential property values are adversely affected therefore the number of such distracting signs ought to be reduced and signs permitted shall conform to the standards of this order to reduce these effects all signs not conforming with the provisions of this section are

of this subsection is to protect and preserve the water quality within streams of the city and to protect residents of the city from property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream the city will implement this section by controlling uses and developments within a riparian setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area to 1reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows slowing the velocity of flood waters and regulating base flow 2stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks 3reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams or in runoff before they enter streams 4provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream channels 5reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse and connected riparian vegetation 6provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation 7benefit the city economically by minimizing encroachment on stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering solutions such as dams and riprap to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents and by contributing to the scenic beauty and to the environment of the city the quality of life of the residents of the city and corresponding property values bthis section has been enacted to protect these services of riparian areas by

purpose of this chapter is to protect and preserve the water quality within streams of the city and to protect residents of the city from property loss and damage because of flooding and other impacts of the stream the city will implement this chapter by controlling uses and developments within a riparian setback that would impair the ability of the riparian area to 1reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows slowing the velocity of flood waters and regulating base flow 2stabilize the banks of streams to reduce bank erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from stream banks 3reduce pollutants in streams during periods of high flows by filtering settling and transforming pollutants already present in streams or in runoff before they enter streams 4provide areas for natural meandering and lateral movement of stream channels 5reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain diverse and connected riparian vegetation 6provide high quality stream habitats with shade and food to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse and connected riparian vegetation 7benefit the city economically by minimizing encroachment on stream channels and reducing the need for costly engineering solutions such as dams and riprap to protect structures and reduce property damage and threats to the safety of watershed residents and by contributing to the scenic beauty
