128101 findings of fact it is hereby determined that  128102 purpose the purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public residing within the village and to address a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation  e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow  f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the village  g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety  i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development  128101 taxation  128102  the findings of fact set forth in  128101 of
