the citizens of the city of seatac and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location of sexuallyoriented businesses within the city it is not the intent of the city that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to impose a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexuallyoriented materials similarly it is not the intent of the city that it should be the effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexuallyoriented materials protected by the state or federal constitutions or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexuallyoriented material to their intended market neither is it the intent of the city that it should be the purpose or effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials    findings based upon a wide range of evidence presented to the seatac city council and to other jurisdictions including but not limited to the testimony of law enforcement officers and members of public and on other evidence information publications articles studies documents case law and material submitted to and reviewed and considered by the city council and staff the councils of other cities within the region and in other jurisdictions nonprofit organizations and other legislative bodies the city council makes the following findings acertain conduct occurring on premises offering sexuallyoriented business creates secondary impacts that are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such conduct must be regulated as provided herein bregulation of the sexuallyoriented business industry or licensing is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred cproximity between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances can facilitate sexual contact prostitution and related crimes concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the city which demand reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health safety and general welfare dit is necessary to license entertainers in the sexuallyoriented industry to prevent the exploitation of minors to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible ethe evidence supporting the need to protect minors and families from the criminal and other unlawful activities associated with the operation of sexuallyoriented businesses is compelling the provisions of this chapter are necessary to ensure that sexuallyoriented uses in seatac are conducted a reasonable distance away from places where minors regularly gather often in large numbers fit is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of sexuallyoriented businesses at such times as such establishments are offering sexuallyoriented business so there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees gthe license fees required herein are nominal fees imposed as necessary cost recoupment measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the sexuallyoriented businesses and in increased police costs in enforcement henterprises providing sexuallyoriented businesses are increasingly associated with ongoing prostitution disruptive conduct and other criminal activity such businesses are currently not subject to effective regulation and constitute an immediate threat to the public peace health and safety the hours of operation of such businesses have a significant impact on the occurrence of illegal drug transactions and other criminal activities idue to the information presented regarding the connection of prostitution with sexuallyoriented businesses there is concern over sexuallytransmitted diseases which is a legitimate health concern of the city and thus requires regulation of sexuallyoriented businesses in order to protect the health safety and wellbeing of the public jmany cities including seattle and tacoma have experienced negative secondary impacts from sexuallyoriented business land uses the skid row effect is one of these secondary impacts and is evident in certain parts of seattle such an effect would be significantly magnified in seatac due to the difference in size and characteristics of the city kthe city of seatac may rely on the experiences and studies of other cities counties and organizations in assessing the need for regulation of sexuallyoriented business uses operations and licensing lthe city takes notice of studies and experiences of other cities and counties in combating the specific adverse impacts of sexuallyoriented businesses mregulation of sexuallyoriented businesses should be developed to prevent deterioration andor degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists rather than in response to an existing problem nincreased levels of criminal activities occur in the vicinity of sexuallyoriented businesses additionally hidden ownership interests for the purpose of skimming profits avoiding payment of taxes and racketeering have historically occurred in sexuallyoriented businesses in the absence of regulations othe city council therefore finds that the protection and the preservation of the public health safety and welfare requires establishment of this chapter pthere are sufficient important and substantial government interests to provide a

the zone in which the subject property is located  and 3that the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated  and 4that the special circumstances necessitating the variance have not resulted from any action of the applicant  and 5that the requested variance will not create a use not generally permitted within the zone in which the subject property is located cthe requested variance is decided by the citys hearing examiner public hearing process except in cases where the requested change involves less than twenty percent 20% variance to a standard in these cases the variance may be decided by the director provided the following criteria are

for both the house and the neighborhood image example example of well designed townhouses the following design standards are intended to implement the citys vision for housing as set forth in the city of seatac comprehensive plan the standards serve three 3 basic purposes to promote quality development  to increase neighborhood compatibility  and to enhance security aquality design a quality development is one that is functional and pleasant for its residents as well as the public such a development starts with an investment in quality materials that will not rapidly decay and design that ensures ample privacy as well as amenities for residents welldesigned environments will provide places for residents to meet and visit open spaces located to take advantage of sunny exposures and safe places for children to play a high quality development will also contribute to an attractive streetscape by providing buildings with architectural detailing entries that present themselves with an air of pride and landscaping that adds color texture and comfort to a neighborhood bneighborhood compatibility good design also ensures neighborhood compatibility by appropriate scale and massing adjacent to existing housing landscaping and the careful placement of windows and balconies for privacy help to create a pleasant environment cenhanced security crime prevention through environmental design cpted is a concept that employs site and building design as a crime prevention strategy intended to reduce the opportunity for criminal behavior reduce the incidence and fear of crime reduce calls for police service and improve the quality of life it includes four 4 principles 1natural surveillance the arrangement of space and buildings that enables residents to observe their surroundings natural surveillance increases safety by allowing residents to see trespassers making a potential offender feel that they will be seen and reported discourages criminal behavior see figure natural surveillance image figure natural surveillance windows and balconies overlooking a street contribute to an active and safe streetscape 2natural access control the placement of walkways building entrances fences landscaping and lighting to discourage access to crime targets and create the perception of risk to offenders natural access control enhances safety which reduces or supplements the use of more costly access control such as security guards and mechanical devices 3territorial reinforcement extending the sense of ownership from the private residence to the nearby areas outside the dwelling improvements such as fencing pavement landscaping and lighting clearly defined territory deters entrance by those with criminal intent and makes their actions more visible and likely to be reported by those who recognize the territory as their own 4maintenance ensuring that buildings and grounds are maintained for resident safety neighborhood aesthetics and to reflect building management maintenance serves as an expression of ownership and allows for continued use of the space for its intended purpose maintenance prevents a reduction of visibility from landscaping and obstructed or inoperative lighting a clean and wellmaintained site tells offenders that residents care about their surroundings and criminal behavior will not be tolerated townhouse and duplex developments subject to the design standards in this chapter are envisioned to create developments that are good places to live these developments will respond better to existing communities and contribute positively to the emergent urban center of the city of seatac   authority and application athe provisions of this chapter shall apply to all townhouse and duplex developments throughout the

design and effective use of the built environment in order to reduce the fear and incidence of crime and improve the quality of life bcpted involves the design of a physical space so that it enhances the needs of the intended users this emphasis on design and use deviates from the traditional target hardening approach to crime prevention cowners managers and community users have a joint responsibility to report to the police all suspicious activities and criminal occurrences  without this the effectiveness of cpted is minimized establishing and maintaining partnerships between the community and the city of seatac will create improvement in quality of life issues make for a safer environment and a more productive community dfor cpted to be successful it must be understandable and practicable for the normal users of the space the normal users are more familiar with the local area and have a vested interest their own wellbeing in ensuring their immediate environment operates properly the threed approach to space assessment provides a simple guide for the normal users in determining the appropriateness of how their space is designed and used the threed concept is based on the three functions or dimensions of human space 1designation all human space has some designated purpose how does the design support function is the use clear supported by signs 2definition all human space has social cultural legal or physical definitions that prescribe the desired and acceptable behaviors is it clear who owns or manages it 3design all human space is designed to support and

by the following five 5 overlapping principles that are applied to specific sites and situations aterritoriality territoriality is a design concept that clearly delineates private space from semipublic and public spaces and also creates a sense of ownership ownership thereby creates an environment where appearances of such strangers and intruders stand out and are more easily identified the enhanced feeling of legitimate ownership by reinforcing existing natural surveillance and natural access control strategies with additional symbolic or social ones 2the design of space to allow for its continued use and intended purpose 3the use of pavement treatments landscaping art signage screening and fences define and outline ownership of space bnatural surveillance natural surveillance is a design concept directed primarily at keeping intruders under observation provision of natural surveillance helps to create environments where there is sufficient opportunity for people engaged in their normal behavior to observe the space around them areas can be designed so they are more easily observed design and placement of physical features to maximize visibility this may include building orientation windows entrances and exits parking lots refuse containers walkways guard gates landscape trees and shrubs use of wrought iron fences or walls signage and other physical obstructions 2placement of persons or activities to maximize surveillance possibilities 3minimum maintained lighting standards that provide for nighttime illumination of parking lots walkways entrances exits and related areas to promote a safe environment caccess control access control is a design concept directed primarily at decreasing criminal accessibility provision of natural access control limits access and increases natural surveillance to restrict criminal intrusion especially into areas where they will not be easily observed intruders are more readily recognized the use of sidewalks pavement gates lighting and landscaping to clearly guide the public to and from entrances and exits 2the use of gates fences walls landscaping and lighting to prevent or discourage public access to or from dark or unmonitored areas d activity support activity support is the presence of activity planned for the space and involves placing activity where the individuals engaged in an activity will become part of the natural surveillance system examples include 1place safe activities in areas that will discourage wouldbe offenders to increase the natural surveillance of these activities and the perception of safety for normal users and the perception of risk for offenders 2place highrisk activities in safer locations to overcome the vulnerability of these activities by using natural surveillance and access control of the safe area 3locate gathering areas in locations that provide for natural surveillance and access control or in locations away from the view of wouldbe offenders 4improve the scheduling of space to allow for effective use and appropriate intensity of accepted behaviors emaintenance proper maintenance of landscaping lighting treatment and other features can facilitate the principles of cpted functions include 1proper maintenance of lighting fixtures to prescribed standards 2landscaping which is maintained at prescribed standards 3minimizing the conflicts between

structure standards illuminance standards  application parking structure standards apply to covered and enclosed facilities intended for use by the general public for those used by residents customers and employees of apartment buildings or commercial developments they are not intended to apply to parking structures used exclusively for repair or storage of commercial vehicles or where attendants park vehicles   purpose athis chapter establishes cpted design and lighting standards for parking structures these standards include interior and exterior cpted strategies for the reasonably safe movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in parking structures the enhancement of personal security and deterrence of vandalism theft and assault while conserving energy and minimizing maintenance bparking structures comprise a large volume of space with relatively low levels of activity violent crime is more likely to occur in a parking structure than in other commercial facilities many parking structures lack cpted features because property owners and architects are not familiar with basic principles of design concepts for crime prevention although cpted principles can be readily incorporated into parking structures at design and construction stages it is often difficult and expensive to upgrade security at a later date incorporating cpted can significantly reduce the fear and risk of crime cparking lots and parking structures have vehicular speeds that are much lower than roadways more importantly the primary purpose of lighting here is to benefit the pedestrian dthe illuminance requirements of a parking facility are affected by the layout operation and vehicular traffic safety issues plus the visibility and security needs of pedestrians walking to and from their vehicles lighting for parking structures should provide not only the recommended minimum illuminance levels but also good color rendition uniformity and minimal glare   parking structure standards parking structures shall meet the recommendations of the iesna handbook at a minimum the following standards shall be used in the construction of parking structures it is required that the developer comply with lighting for parking facilities recommended practices rp2098 and roadway lighting as delineated in the iesna handbook 9th edition afor security reasons it is recommended to locate stairs and elevators adjacent to a street where the lobbies are visible from the street bpedestrian walkways shall be elevated similar to a speed humpbump in order to allow pedestrians greater visibility and to assist in slowing cars when in the vicinity of pedestrians cpotential hiding places below stairs shall be closed off if used for storage such areas shall be secured with doors and locks ddirectional arrows indicating stairs elevators and exits shall be painted on walls or indicated with illuminated signs eremote exterior stairway doors shall be equipped with oneway locks allowing people to exit but not to enter the facility at those locations fpedestrian entrances shall be concentrated to bring all pedestrians 1 portal which improves the ability to see and be seen by others gany groundlevel pedestrian exits that open into nonsecure areas shall be emergency exits only and fitted with selflocking doors hactive security measures such as emergency phones and closed circuit television cctv are recommended ifencing shall not be used unless security dictates if necessary a six 6 foot high blackcoated chain link fence is recommended openings in the fence should be located carefully with only a minimum number of openings allowing cars and pedestrians to enter and leave jlandscape plantings shall not be located within three 3 feet of the interior curbing of the perimeter of the parking lot   illuminance standards alighting shall be positioned to illuminate both horizontally and vertically illumination must reach into the edges of the parking stalls rather than just the driving aisles to minimize dark hiding places between cars bto minimize glare lights shall be positioned between parked vehicles rather than in the center of drive aisles ccutoff luminaries shall be required on all lighting mounted higher than twelve 12 feet above the floor dinterior parking structure walls beam faces and underside of floor slabs shall be stained or painted a light color preferably white or light blue to increase the general brightness in parking structures antigraffiti coating added to walls should be considered ethe illuminance requirements for parking structures shall be in accordance with the standards in table a the illuminance shall be measured or calculated on an unobstructed floor the maximum and minimum values are maintained illuminance levels  this occurs just prior to lamp replacement and luminaire cleaning vertical illuminances of objects such as walls and columns shall be equal to the horizontal values given in table a these vertical values

private street lighting application purpose street lighting standards street lighting fixtures  application lighting of private streets is not mandatory but if it is desired these standards shall apply   purpose this chapter establishes lighting levels for private streets in order to limit the impact from the lighting to the surrounding properties while also providing for traffic safety and increasing the pedestrians sense of security   street lighting standards aif street lighting is installed the general levels of illumination shall be consistent with the iesna handbook figure 228 and the average illumination level may not exceed those specified in the iesna handbook by more than 02 footcandles bthe uniformity ratio shall not exceed that specified by the iesna handbook if the street has a sidewalk on only one 1 side the streetlights shall be located on the side of the street that the sidewalk is on   street lighting fixtures aall street lighting fixtures shall be cutoff fixtures as defined by iesna if necessary as determined by cpted review fixtures shall include glare shields to minimize light directed to the rear of the fixtures or on to adjacent properties the maximum mounting height of street lights is twenty 20 feet bif the design for an area suggests the use of street lighting fixtures of a particular period or architectural style or existing historical fixtures are to be retained then the noncutoff fixtures may be used either as alternatives or supplements to street lighting described above 1for fixtures that do not meet the cutoff criteria the maximum initial lumens generated by each fixture shall not exceed two thousand 2000 lumens 2mounting heights of such fixtures shall not exceed fifteen 15 feet for new fixtures where historic fixtures are being retained andor extended mounting height shall be that of the existing fixtures  gasolineservice station and convenience store lighting purpose standards  purpose this chapter establishes lighting levels for gasoline stations convenience store aprons and under freestanding canopies to ensure adequate lighting for the activities taking place in such locations   standards aareas on the apron away from the gasoline pump islands used for parking or vehicle storage shall be illuminated in accordance with the requirements for surface parking areas set forth in smc if no gasoline pumps are provided the entire apron shall be treated as a parking area bareas around the pump islands and under canopies shall be illuminated so that the minimum horizontal illuminance at grade level is at least one 1 footcandle and no more than five and onehalf 55 footcandles the uniformity ratio shall be no greater than four to one  maximum illumination level shall be no more than twentytwo 22

industrial retail and multifamily development   purpose this chapter establishes recommendations for interior design to minimize risk and opportunities for crime the following design features are recommended to conform with cpted standards main entry and lobby areas location of receptionist areas in relation to windows and points of access control adjacent offices that would promote surveillance into the main entry and lobby areas location of stairwells hallways elevators rest rooms pay phones and drinking fountains patio or break areas type of glazing use of electronic monitoring devices and general floor plans the design considerations and examples are for use by developers architects and planners the design standards specified under smc  are strongly recommended but not required   interior design considerations aavoid isolating an individual entrance at the end of a hall or head of stairs breduce the number of rooms sharing a common hallway cplace windows in doors of stair landings dplace restrooms in central areas erefrain from placing restrooms near stairs or exterior doors fposition lounge and common areas to provide direct line of sight to hallways guse windows in blank walls hcreate minor obstacles or passage points to prevent easy movement from very public areas to private areas iplace windows overlooking entrances jrestrooms provided in a parking facility shall have mazetype entrances instead of outerinner doors that could trap a victim  landscaping purpose location height and plant standards  purpose the positioning location type of plant material screening and other landscape elements should allow for natural surveillance from within buildings from outdoor locations on the site from adjacent buildings and from the public rightsofway landscaping and screening should complement efforts to define public semipublic and private areas natural access control can be achieved by emphasizing natural strategies that integrate behavior management design of space and the choice of plant materials dense plantings of thorny plant materials can provide a formidable barrier which is difficult to penetrate security is enhanced when walkways entrances to buildings and exits from buildings are open and permit a view to and from the surrounding neighborhood and adjacent sites the more open the view of a space is the less likely that space will be used for the commission of a crime   location height and plant standards awindows 1plants trees shrubs etc shall be no higher than sill height within five 5 feet in front of

history and requirements of the shoreline management act awashingtons shoreline management act act was adopted by the public in a 1972 referendum to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the states shorelines the act has three 3 broad policies 1encourage waterdependent uses uses shall be preferred which are consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment or are unique to or dependent upon use of the states shorelines 2protect shoreline natural resources including the land and its vegetation and wildlife and the water of the state and their aquatic life 3promote public access the publics opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of natural shorelines of the state shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the state and the people generally bthis act recognizes that shorelines are among the most valuable and fragile of the states resources the act and the city of seatac recognize and protect private property rights along the shoreline while aiming to preserve the quality of this unique resource for all state residents cthe primary purpose of the act is to provide for the management and protection of the states shoreline resources by planning for reasonable and appropriate uses in order to protect the public interest in preserving these shorelines the act establishes a coordinated planning program between the state and local jurisdictions to use in addressing the types and effects of development occurring along the states shorelines by law the city is responsible for the following 1development of an inventory of the natural characteristics and land use patterns along shorelines covered by the act 2preparation of a master program to determine the future of the shorelines 3development of a permit system to further the goals and policies of both the act and the local master plan 4development of a restoration plan that includes goals policies and actions for restoration of impaired shoreline ecological functions exh a 11  master program development and public participation the city of seatac city obtained a grant from the washington department of ecology ecology in 2007 to conduct a comprehensive shoreline master program smp update the first step of the update process was to inventory the citys shorelines as defined by the states shoreline management act sma rcw angle lake is the only sma shoreline in the city of seatac the inventory describes existing biological and physical conditions these conditions were then analyzed and characterized to create a baseline from which future development actions in the shoreline will be measured environmental designations were identified for the different shoreline reaches and goals policies and regulations for each were developed the guidelines require that the city demonstrate that its updated smp yields no net loss in shoreline ecological functions relative to the baseline due to its implementation ideally the smp in combination with other city and regional efforts will ultimately produce a net improvement in shoreline ecological functions the city obtained a second grant from ecology in 2018 to complete a periodic smp update washington state law requires jurisdictions to review and update their smps every eight 8 years in accordance with the shoreline management act sma and its current guidelines and legislative rules to attain state approval the periodic update to this smp focused on reviewing relevant legislative updates since the comprehensive update and incorporating any applicable amendments and ensuring consistency with the citys 2017 comprehensive plan update and other city regulations exh a 12  purposes of the shoreline master program the purposes of this master program are ato carry out the responsibilities imposed on the city of seatac by the washington state shoreline management act rcw bto promote the public health safety and general welfare by providing a guide and regulation for the future development of the shoreline resources of the city of seatac cto further by adoption the policies of rcw and the goals of this master program both of which hereafter follow dto comply with the shoreline master program guidelines wac including a particular focus on including regulations and mitigation standards to ensure that development under the shoreline master program will not cause a net loss of ecological functions exh a 13  legislative findings and washington shoreline management policies the washington state legislature finds the shorelines of the state are among the most valuable and fragile of its natural resources and there is great concern throughout the state relating to their utilization protection restoration and preservation in addition it finds that ever increasing pressures of additional uses are being placed on the shorelines necessitating increased coordination in the management and development of the shorelines of the state the legislature further finds that much of the shorelines of the state and uplands adjacent thereto are in private ownership and that unrestricted construction on the privately owned or publicly owned shorelines of the state is not in the best public interest  therefore coordinated planning is necessary in order to protect the public interest associated with the shorelines of the state while at the same time recognizing and protecting private property rights consistent with the public interest there is therefore a clear and urgent demand for a planned rational and concerted effort jointly performed by federal state and local governments to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the states shorelines it is the policy of the state to provide for the management of the shorelines of the state by planning for and fostering all reasonable and appropriate uses this policy is designed to ensure the development of these shorelines in a manner which while allowing for limited reduction of rights of the public in navigable water will promote and enhance the public interest this policy is intended to protect against adverse effects to the public health the land and its vegetation and wildlife and the water of the state and its aquatic life while generally protecting public rights of navigation and its associated activities exh a 14  shoreline master program basics the seatac shoreline master program is a planning document that outlines goals and policies for the shoreline of the city and establishes regulations for development occurring in that area in order to preserve and enhance the shoreline of seatac it is important that all development proposals relating to the shoreline area be evaluated in terms of the citys shoreline master program and that the city shoreline administrator be consulted some developments may be exempt from regulation while others may need to stay within established guidelines or may require a conditional use permit application or variance application  all proposals must comply with the policies and regulations established by the state shoreline management act as expressed local shoreline master program adopted by the city of seatac the shoreline management act defines for local jurisdictions the content and goals that should be represented in the shoreline master programs developed by each community  within these guidelines it is left to each community to develop the specific regulations appropriate to that community under the act all shorelines of the state meeting the criteria established receive a given shoreline environmental designation the purpose of the shoreline designation system is to ensure that all land use development or other activity occurring within the designated shoreline jurisdiction is appropriate for that area and provides consideration for the special requirements of that environment seatac has designated its angle lake shorelines under five 5 shoreline environments aquatic urban conservancy shoreline residential mediumintensity and highintensity these environments are described in of this chapter shoreline environments persons proposing any shoreline development land use or other projects in the shoreline area must consult with the city of seatac shoreline master program administrator the city of seatacs community and economic development director to determine how the proposal is addressed in the master program the citys shoreline administrator will determine if a proposal is exempt from a shoreline substantial development permit ie qualifies for a shoreline exemption as well as provide information on the permit application process requests for variances conditional use permits and substantial development permits require review and recommendation by the citys shoreline administrator with the decision by the hearing

and support major shoreline management issues the elements required by rcw 2 when appropriate are aeconomic development element  bpublic access element  crecreational element  dcirculation element  eshoreline use element  fconservation element  ghistoric cultural scientific and educational element  and han element that gives consideration to the statewide interest in the prevention and minimization of flood damages exh a 31  economic development element the shoreline master program for the city of seatac contains limited provisions for economic development along the shoreline of angle lake angle lake is substantially developed with residential uses with little undeveloped shoreline remaining a small portion of the lakes shoreline in the western corner allows a broader range of uses including limited commercial uses angle lake is a relatively small water body that does not have a navigable connection to other water bodies so it is not regarded as a commercial transportation route as such access to the water is primarily related to recreation and residential uses and is not considered particularly important to commercial or industrial interests there are three 3 parcels at the west end of the lake that have been developed for commercial use as well as additional parcels where a mix of land uses including some commercial use is allowed under existing zoning in particular there are two 2 vacant parcels at the west end of the city that are expected to be developed at some point in the future goal ed1 ensure that any economic activity taking place along the shoreline operates without harming the sites environmental quality or adjacent shorelands and that new nonresidential development provides public access to the shoreline for waterenjoyment

function for the health of aquatic ecosystems vegetation management involves both a passive and active management system the intent of both systems is to minimize habitat loss and the impact of invasive plants erosion sedimentation and flooding passive vegetation management deals with protection and enhancement of existing diverse native plant communities along all shorelines active vegetation management involves aquatic weed control as well as the restoration of altered or threatened shorelines using a technology called soil bioengineering soil bioengineering reestablishes native plant communities as a dynamic system that stabilizes the land from the effects of erosion aapplicability clearing and grading is the activity associated with developing property for a particular use including commercial industrial recreational and residential specifically clearing means the destruction or removal of vegetative ground cover andor trees including but not limited to root material removal andor topsoil removal grading means any excavating filling removing the duff layer or combination thereof grading can also involve either the export of materials off site or the import of materials from an offsite source both of these activities may cause erosion siltation increased runoff and flood volumes reduced flood storage capacity and habitat damage vegetation conservation includes activities to protect and restore vegetation along or near freshwater shorelines that contribute to the ecological functions of shoreline areas vegetation conservation provisions include the prevention or restriction of plant clearing and earth grading vegetation restoration and the control of invasive weeds and nonnative species as with all master program provisions vegetation management provisions apply even to those shorelines and uses which are exempt from a permit requirement like other master program provisions vegetation conservation standards do not apply retroactively to existing uses and structures such as existing agricultural practices or the regular maintenance of existing ornamental residential landscapes bshoreline vegetation conservation policies 1all clearing and grading activities should be designed and conducted to minimize impacts to wildlife habitat minimize sedimentation of lakes and to minimize degradation of water quality 2clearing and grading activities in shoreline areas should be limited to the minimum necessary to accommodate shoreline development such activities should be discouraged in designated structural setback areas and allowed in other shoreline locations only when associated with a permitted shoreline development 3adverse environmental and shoreline impacts of clearing and grading should be

attenuation temperature regulation and bank stabilization encourage homeowners and property managers to leave diseased and fallen trees in place along the shoreline edge provided the trees are not a danger to public safety or private property 13use soil bioengineering techniques when restoring degraded shorelines wherever feasible to minimize the processes of erosion sedimentation and flooding 14development of tax parcel 0422049009 should include natural area preservation and enhancement in addition to public access along the waterfront 15the removal of mature trees and native vegetation along angle lake should be regulated in a manner that provides greater protection than the current tree retention regulations  in particular removal of nonhazardous mature trees and native vegetation within the required setback of angle lake should be severely restricted 16the city of seatac should provide information to the public about environmentally appropriate vegetation management landscaping for shoreline properties and alternatives to the use of pesticides and herbicides which impact water quality and aquatic habitat 17property owners should use the following best management practices bmps when maintaining residential landscapes aavoid use of herbicides fertilizers insecticides and fungicides along drainage channels and shores of angle lake as well as in the water blimit the amount of lawn and garden watering so that there is no surface runoff cdispose of grass clippings leaves or twigs properly  do not sweep these materials into the street into a body of water or near a storm drain 18aquatic weed management should involve usage of native plant materials wherever possible in soil bioengineering applications and habitat restoration activities where active removal or destruction of aquatic vegetation is necessary it should be done only to the extent necessary to allow waterdependent activities to continue removal or modification of aquatic vegetation should be conducted in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to native plant communities and should include appropriate handling or disposal of weed materials and attached sediments 19monitor and control aquatic invasive species in angle lake to maintain eradication of water lily and prevent establishment of other aquatic invasive species 20discourage extensive lawns due to their limited

disturb the bottom sediment or benthos shall be considered development for which a shoreline substantial development permit is required 17the application of herbicides or pesticides in angle lake wetlands or ditches requires a permit from the washington department of ecology and may require preparation of a sepa checklist for review by other agencies the individuals involved must obtain a pesticide applicator license from the washington state department of agriculture exh a 46  water quality stormwater and nonpoint pollution aapplicability water quality is affected in numerous ways by human occupation and development of shoreline areas typically the increase in impermeable surfaces as a result of development increases stormwater runoff volumes causing higher peak stormwater discharges at higher velocities that cause scouring and erosion of stream banks erosion increases suspended solids concentrations and turbidity in receiving waters and carries heavy metals household wastes excess nutrients and other pollutants into these waters increased nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment results in algal growth that depresses levels of dissolved oxygen in receiving waters the degradation of water quality adversely impacts wildlife habitat and public health maintaining high water quality standards and restoring degraded systems have been mandated in rcw in february of 200 the city received its western washington phase ii municipal stormwater permit from the washington state department of ecology under this permit the city developed a stormwater management program the city has adopted the king county stormwater drainage manual which applies to all development activities within the city bwater quality stormwater and nonpoint pollution policies 1all shoreline uses and activities should be located designed constructed and maintained to mitigate the adverse impacts to water quality 2water quality education efforts should be used to reduce the potential sources of pollutants to angle lake and other natural waterways the reduction of the sources of fecal coliform should be emphasized in the angle lake subbasin until the city can provide sufficient data to the department ecology to have the 303d listing removed from angle lake these pollutant sources include failing septic systems ducks geese and dog feces 3stormwater impacts should be addressed application of the most recent edition of the adopted surface water design manual and all applicable city stormwater regulations 4new impervious surfaces should be limited within the shoreline management area by setting maximum impervious surface standards for new development and redevelopment and encouraging the use of pervious pavements and other low impact development technologies 5the city should work with midway sewer district and the king county health department to ensure existing septic systems are working properly to prevent groundwater and surface water degradation inputs of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus and hazardous microbes 6the city should work with midway sewer district to require connection to the sanitary sewer system when existing properties on septic systems are developed redeveloped or substantially modified 7the city should continue to provide general information to the public about the use of land and human activities which impact water quality this could be accomplished by encouraging educational curricula that provide students with firsthand exposure to the issues and solutions and activities such as adoptastream programs 8the city should encourage homeowners and property managers to use nonchemical weed and pest control solutions and natural fertilizers cwater quality stormwater and nonpoint pollution regulations 1all shoreline development both during and after construction shall minimize impacts related to surface runoff treatment and release of surface water runoff such that there is no net loss of receiving water quality in the shoreline

intent of a shoreline environment designation is to preserve and enhance shoreline ecological functions and to encourage development that will enhance the present or desired future character of the shoreline to accomplish this shoreline segments are given an environment designation based on existing development patterns biological capabilities and limitations and the aspirations of the local citizenry benvironment designations are categories that reflect the type of development that has or should take place in a given area the shoreline master program guidelines recommend classifying shoreline environments using the following categories highintensity shoreline residential urban conservancy rural conservancy natural and aquatic cthese categories represent a relative range of development from high to lowintensity land use 1highintensity is appropriate for areas of highintensity wateroriented commercial transportation and industrial development 2shoreline residential is intended to accommodate residential development and appropriate public access and recreational uses consistent with other elements of shoreline management 3urban conservancy is a designation designed to protect and restore the ecological functions of open space floodplain and other sensitive lands where they exist in urban and developed areas 4rural conservancy is intended for areas that protect ecological functions and conserve existing natural resources and that support or have the capability to support agricultural and recreational uses 5natural is intended to protect shorelines that remain relatively free of human influence or that include intact or minimally degraded shoreline functions that cannot support human use 6and finally aquatic is a designation intended to protect restore and manage the areas waterward of the ordinary high water mark dadditionally local governments may establish an alternative environment designations  provided that it is consistent with the purposes and policies of the shoreline management act and the guidelines including wac 173262115 for the city of seatac a locally unique mediumintensity parallel environmental designation is established for upland areas on tax parcel 0422049009 running parallel to this is the more protective designation urban conservancy which is assigned to the area along the lakeshore ecology acknowledges the need for parallel designations in some cases to balance between use and protection eonce a shoreline segment has been given an environment designation management policies are developed these management policies are used as the basis for determining uses and activities that can be permitted in each environment designation specific development standards are also established which specify how and where permitted development can take place within each shoreline environment exh a 51  need for consistency athe shoreline management act requires that policies for lands adjacent to the shorelines be consistent with the shoreline management act implementing rules and the local shoreline master program conversely local comprehensive plans provide the underlying framework within which master program provisions should fit the growth management act requires that shoreline master program policies be incorporated as an element of the comprehensive plan and that all elements be internally consistent in addition under the growth management act all development regulations must be consistent with the comprehensive plan bthe shoreline guidelines identify three 3 criteria for use in evaluating the consistency between master program environment designation provisions and the corresponding comprehensive plan elements and development regulations in order for shoreline designation provisions local comprehensive plan land use designations and development regulations to be internally consistent all three 3 of the conditions below should be met 1provisions not precluding one another comprehensive plan provisions and shoreline environment designation provisions should not preclude one another to meet this criterion the provisions of both the comprehensive plan and the master program must be able to be met further when considered together and applied to any one 1 piece of property the master program use policies and regulations and the local zoning or other use regulations should not conflict in a manner that all viable uses of the property are precluded 2use compatibility land use policies and regulations should protect preferred shoreline uses from being impacted by incompatible uses the intent is to prevent existing or potential future wateroriented uses especially waterdependent uses from being restricted on shoreline areas because of impacts to nearby nonwateroriented uses to be consistent master programs comprehensive plans and development regulations should prevent new uses that are not compatible with preferred uses from locating where they may restrict preferred uses or development 3sufficient infrastructure infrastructure and services provided in the comprehensive plan should be sufficient to support allowed shoreline uses shoreline uses should not be allowed where the comprehensive plan does not provide sufficient roads utilities and other services to support them infrastructure plans must also be mutually consistent with shoreline designations where they do exist utility services routed areas shall not be a sole justification for more intense development exh a 52  city of seatac shoreline environment designations athis master program establishes five 5 shoreline environments for the city of seatac these shoreline environments shall include the shorelines of the city of seatac including shorelands surface waters and bedlands bthese environments are derived from the seatac shoreline analysis report the seatac comprehensive plan and the environments recommended by the shoreline

functions necessary to sustain shoreline natural resources and to prevent reduce and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of proposed shoreline modifications consistent with the goals of the shoreline management act a proposed development must meet all of the regulations for both applicable uses and activities as well as the general and environment designation regulations this article has

shoreline stabilization aapplicability shoreline stabilization includes actions taken to address erosion impacts to property caused by natural processes such as current flood wake or wave action these actions include all structural and nonstructural methods hard structural stabilization measures refer to those with solid hard surfaces such as concrete or boulder bulkheads while soft structural measures rely on less rigid materials such as bioengineered vegetation measures or beach enhancement nonstructural methods include building setbacks relocation of the structure to be protected ground water management planning and regulatory measures to avoid the need for structural stabilization generally the harder the construction measure the greater the impact on shoreline processes including sediment transport geomorphology and biological functions the means taken to reduce damage caused by erosion accretion and flooding must recognize the positive aspects of each of these processes in order to retain the benefits of these natural occurrences erosion does not occur without accretion deposition and accumulation of material eroded such as formation of a beach or a sandbar likewise accretion cannot occur unless material has been eroded specific structural methods for stabilization include beach restoration and enhancement soil bioengineering bulkheads and groins along angle lake a key regulatory distinction in this smp is made between new stabilization measures and the replacement of existing stabilization measures new stabilization measures include the enlargement of existing structures some of these techniques are currently being used in seatac as described below or they are techniques that could be used to address local shoreline issues general policies and regulations addressing shoreline stabilization methods applicable to the city are presented in the following sections additional discussion of the individual stabilization methods and policies and regulations specific to them is provided following the general policies and regulations section 1beach restoration or enhancement on angle lake beach enhancement is the alteration of exposed and submerged shorelines for the purpose of stabilization recreational enhancement andor aquatic habitat creation or restoration using native or similar material the materials used are dependent on the intended use for recreational purposes various grades of clean sand or pea gravel are often used to create a beach above the ordinary high water mark restoration or recreation of a shore feature may require a rock and gravel matrix andor creation of other materials appropriate for the intended use 2soil bioengineering soil bioengineering is the term given to the practice of using natural vegetative materials to stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion this may include use of bundles of stems root systems or other living plant material  fabric or other soil stabilization techniques  and limited rock toe protection where appropriate soil bioengineering projects often include fisheries habitat enhancement measures such as anchored logs or root wads in project design soil bioengineering techniques may be applied to shoreline areas and the upland areas away from the immediate shoreline the use of soil bioengineering as a shoreline stabilization technique is a viable and proven alternative to riprap concrete and other structural solutions it provides habitat while maintaining and preserving the natural character of the shoreline soil bioengineering is the preferred best practices choice when considering shoreline stabilization 3bulkheads bulkheads are shoreline structures either sloped or vertical usually constructed parallel to the shore the primary purpose they serve is to contain and prevent the loss of soil caused by erosion or wave action bulkheads have historically been constructed of pouredinplace or precast concrete concrete blocks steel or aluminum sheet piling wood or wood and structural steel combinations and boulders bulkheads may be either thin structures penetrating deep into the ground or more massive structures resting on the surface uses and activities related to bulkheads which are identified as separate use activities in this program such as fill and residential development are subject to the regulations for those uses in addition to the standards for bulkheads established in this section 4groins groins are barriertype structures of rock wooden piling or other materials constructed across the beach itself and extending into the water with the intent to obstruct sand and sediment carried by the littoral drift action along shorelines groins have limited applicability in seatacs shoreline jurisdiction because of the relatively small size of angle lake bgeneral policies 1proposals for shoreline stabilization activities should address the impact of these activities on the shoreline environment this planning should consider offsite erosion accretion or damage that might occur as a result of shoreline stabilization structures or activities 2explore a range of solutions to reduce the amount of bulkheads and shoreline armoring over time around angle lake and restore natural bank conditions alternative methods to typical shoreline armoring using native vegetation and other natural shoreline features should be the preferred method where feasible 3nonstructural stabilization measures are preferred over soft structural measures soft structural shoreline stabilization measures are strongly preferred over hard structural shoreline stabilization proposals for hard and soft structural solutions including bulkheads should be allowed only when it is demonstrated that nonstructural methods are not feasible hard structural shoreline stabilization measures should be allowed only when it is demonstrated that soft structural measures are not feasible 4structural shoreline stabilization should be permitted

substantial development permit exh a 73  dredging and fill aapplicability although these activities may occur separately from one another they are often all parts of the same shoreline modification process and are therefore considered together in the following policies and regulations 1dredging and dredge material disposal dredging is the removal or displacement of earth or sediments such as gravel sand mud or silt andor other materials or debris from any stream or lake and associated shorelines side channels and wetlands in a lake setting dredging is normally done for specific purposes or uses such as deepening a navigational channel or obtaining bottom material dredge material is disposed of on land or into water bodies and may be intended for the purpose of creating new or additional lands for other uses dredge spoil varies from clean river sand to organic sludge while some of this material is deposited on land a significant portion is dumped intentionally or unintentionally back into the water or immediately adjacent to the water of all activities on shorelines dredging poses one 1 of the greatest threats to water quality and aquatic life in most cases dredging occurs in shallow areas and may disturb the aquatic environment in the following ways a temporary reduction of water clarity from suspended sediments b loss of aquatic plants and animals by direct removal or from the sedimentation of suspended materials c alteration of the nutrient and oxygen levels of the water column and d suspension of toxic materials from the sediments into the water column 2fill fill is the placement of soil sand rock gravel sediment earth retaining structure or other material to an area waterward of the ohwm in wetlands or on shorelands in a manner that raises the elevation or creates dry land fill is usually considered in locations where the water is shallow and where rooted vegetation often occurs in their natural condition these same areas provide valuable habitat for fish and wildlife feeding breeding and shelter biologically the shallow vegetation areas tend to be highly productive portions of the lake for these reasons governmental agencies and scientific experts have generally sought to prohibit or restrict fill the policies contained herein are intended to focus on the aspects of natural systems affected by dredging and the disposal of dredge material manmade fill cuts excavations and site grading actions while at the same time recognizing the communitys needs bpolicies 1dredging adredging should only be allowed as a conditional use

overwater structures  piers docks floats and buoys aapplicability piers and docks are structures which abut the shoreline and are often used as a landing or moorage place for watercraft piers are built on fixed platforms supported by piles above the water while docks float upon the water some piers may terminate in a float section that is connected by a ramp recreational floats are independent anchored offshore platforms used for waterdependent recreational activities such as swimming and diving certain mooring structures such as moorage piles buoys and boat lifts are not generally used on angle lake since an eight 8 mph speed limit and a no wake rule generally result in only small craft using the lake all of these types of facilities have positive and negative environmental aspects floating docks generally have less of a visual impact than piers on pilings however in the nearshore docks can interrupt littoral drift of sediments and other suspended materials and significantly shade the aquatic environment throughout their length pile piers can provide diverse habitat for both desirable and undesirable aquatic life excavated moorage involves dredging and will disturb bottom sediments and aquatic life docks and piers alike create impediments to boat traffic and fish travel pier construction requires regulation to protect navigation to protect shoreline aesthetics and to maintain the usable water surface and aquatic lands for life forms characteristic and important to those areas bexemptions the city will review all development proposals for piers to determine if 1the proposal is or is not exempt from the requirement for a substantial development permit per smc d  2the proposal is suitably located and designed and that all potential impacts have been recognized and mitigated such that there is no net loss of shoreline ecological functions  and 3the proposal is consistent with the intent policies and regulations of the act rcw 12 and this master program cpolicies

these provisions should be applied in a manner which while protecting the environment will assure that a person will be able to use hisher property in a fair and equitable manner 1variances the purpose of a variance is strictly limited to granting relief to specific bulk dimensional or performance standards set forth in the master program and where there are extraordinary or unique circumstances relating to the property such that the strict implementation of the master program would impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the sma policies as stated in rcw  construction pursuant to this permit shall not begin nor can construction be authorized except as provided in rcw  in all instances extraordinary circumstances shall be shown and the public interest shall suffer no substantial detrimental effect aapplication an application for a shoreline variance shall be submitted on a form provided by the city accompanied by maps completed environmental checklist applicable fees and any other information specified in this master program or requested by the administrator an applicant for a substantial development permit who wishes to request a variance shall submit the variance application and the substantial development permit application simultaneously bcriteria for granting variances variances for development that will be located landward of the ordinary high water mark and landward of any wetland may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate consistency with the following variance criteria as listed in wac 17327170 ithat the strict application of the bulk dimensional or performance standards set forth in the master program precludes or significantly interferes with reasonable use of the property iithat the hardship described above is specifically related to the property and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape size or natural features and the application of the master program and not for example from deed restrictions or the applicants own actions iiithat the design of the project is compatible with other permitted activities within the area and with uses planned for the area under the comprehensive plan and master program and will not cause adverse impacts to the shoreline environment ivthat the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by the other properties in the area vthat the variance requested is the minimum necessary to afford relief vithat the public interest will suffer no substantial detrimental effect cvariances for a development andor uses that will be located waterward of the ordinary high water mark or within any wetland may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following ithat the strict application of the bulk dimensional or performance standards set forth in the master program precludes all reasonable use of the property iithat the proposal is consistent with the criteria established under subsection h1b of this section iiithat the public rights of navigation and use of the shorelines will not be adversely affected din the granting of all variances consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area for example if variances were granted to other developments andor uses in the area where similar circumstances exist the total of the variances shall also remain consistent with the policies of rcw  and shall not cause substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment evariances from the use regulations of the master program are prohibited 2conditional uses the purpose of a conditional use permit is to provide a system within the master program which allows flexibility in the application of use regulations in a manner consistent with the policies of rcw  in authorizing a conditional use special conditions may be attached to the permit by the city of seatac or the department of ecology to prevent undesirable effects of the proposed use andor to assure consistency of the project with the act and the master program uses that are specifically prohibited by this master program may not be authorized with the approval of a conditional use permit acriteria for granting shoreline conditional use permits uses which are classified or set forth as conditional uses in the master program may be authorized provided the applicant demonstrate all of the following conditional use criteria as listed in wac 17327160 ithat the proposed use is consistent with the policies of rcw  and the master program  iithat the proposed use will not interfere with the normal public use of public shorelines  iiithat the proposed use of the site and design of the project are compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the comprehensive plan and this master program  ivthat the proposed use will cause no significant adverse effects to the shoreline environment in which it is to be located  and vthat the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect bin the granting of all conditional use permits consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area for example if conditional use permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist the total of the conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of rcw  and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment cother uses which are not classified or set forth in this master program may be authorized as conditional uses provided the applicant can demonstrate consistency with the requirements of this section and the requirements for conditional
