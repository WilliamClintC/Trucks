this chapter is to promote community health safety and welfare by protecting natural vegetation and setting development standards for landscaping street trees fences and walls together these elements of the natural and built environment contribute to the visual quality environmental health and character of the community trees provide climate control during summer months and wind screening during winter trees and other plants can also buffer pedestrians from traffic walls fences trees and other landscape materials also provide vital screening and buffering between land uses landscaped areas help to control surface water drainage and can improve water quality as compared to paved or built surfaces this chapter is organized into the following sections sdc  landscape conservation prevents the indiscriminate removal of significant trees and other vegetation including vegetation associated with streams wetlands and other protected natural resource areas sdc  landscaping sets standards for and requires landscaping of all development sites that require land use review and design review this section also requires buffering for parking and maneuvering areas and between different land use districts note that other relevant standards are provided in land use zoning districts for specific types of development sdc  street trees sets standards for and requires planting of street trees for shading comfort water quality and aesthetic purposes sdc  fences and walls regulates the design of fences and walls including allowable height and materials to promote security personal safety privacy and aesthetics   landscape conservation aapplicability all development sites containing significant vegetation as defined below shall comply with the standards of this section and be subject to development review the purpose of this section is to incorporate significant native vegetation into the landscapes of development and to protect vegetation in sensitive natural areas the use of mature native vegetation within developments is a preferred alternative to removal of vegetation and replanting mature landscaping provides summer shade and wind breaks controls erosion and allows for water conservation due to larger plants having established root systems bsignificant vegetation significant vegetation means street trees and plants within designated sensitive land areas such as floodplains hillside protection areas and wetlands and trees not within such area that have a caliper of six inches or larger at four feet above grade  except that protection shall not be required for nonnative invasive plants blackberries poison oak poison ivy etc and any plants designated by the city as prohibited cmapping and protection required significant vegetation shall be mapped as required by sdc land use review and design review significant trees shall be mapped individually and identified by species and diameter or caliper at four feet above grade a protection area shall be defined around the edge of all branches dripline of each tree driplines may overlap between trees the city also may require an inventory survey or assessment prepared by an arborist or other qualified professional to determine tree health construction boundaries building setbacks andor recommended protection or mitigation requirements dprotection standards trees on public lands shall not be removed cut felled trimmed or otherwise damaged or destroyed except as approved by the city the city may approve removal or trimming when a tree poses an immediate hazard to public safety as determined by the public works director other significant vegetation including vegetation on private property identified as meeting the criteria in subsection b of this section shall be retained to the extent practicable to protect environmental values and to minimize the risk of erosion landslide and stormwater runoff where protection is impracticable because it would prevent reasonable development of public streets utilities or land uses permitted by the applicable land use district the city may allow removal of significant vegetation from the building envelope as defined by required yard setbacks where yard areas must be disturbed to install streets or utilities the applicant may be required to restore such areas after construction with landscaping or other means to prevent erosion and to protect the public health safety and welfare with the owners consent the city may accept a land dedication or become a party to a conservation easement on private property for conservation purposes emitigation required where removal of or impact to significant vegetation is proposed or it is reasonable to expect it will be unavoidable during development the city shall require mitigation review mitigation shall be proportionate to the loss of significant vegetation where complete mitigation on site is not practical due to limitations of the site the city may accept an inlieu fee for mitigation which will occur off site fconstruction all significant vegetation on a site that is not otherwise designated and approved by the city for removal shall be protected prior to during and after construction in accordance with a limitofclearing and grading plan approved by the planning official the city may require chainlink or other protective fencing around significant vegetation and limit grading activities and operation of vehicles and heavy equipment in and around significant vegetation areas to prevent damage to the resource and to prevent erosion pollution or landslide hazards gtree felling review approval is required for the felling of five or more significant trees on a lot or property inside the city limits within a calendar year felling trees at the direction of the city or by the city necessary to remove or alleviate an immediate danger to life or property  removal of any tree that is defined as a nuisance under the silverton municipal   to restore utility service or to reopen or maintain a public street or easement is exempt from review an application following the submittal requirements for a design review shall be submitted to the city for review prior to any tree removal the city may approve the request when the following review criteria are met 1 trees shall be retained in significantly large areas and dense stands so as to ensure against windthrow 2 wooded areas that will likely provide an attractive onsite amenity to occupants of future developments shall be retained 3 wooded areas associated with natural drainage ways and water areas will be maintained to preserve riparian habitat and minimize erosion the wooded area to be retained shall be at least 10 feet in width or as required elsewhere in this code 4 wooded areas along ridges and hilltops will be retained for their scenic and wildlife value 5 tree felling on developable areas will be avoided to retain the wooded character of future building sites and so preserve housing and design options for future city residents 6 wooded areas along property lines shall be retained at a minimum width of 10 feet to provide buffers from adjacent properties 7 the plan for tree felling shall be consistent with the preservation of the sites future development potential and zoning hexemptions the protection standards in subsections d and e of this section do not apply to 1dead or diseased vegetation dead or diseased vegetation meeting the criteria for significant vegetation may be removed after approval of a type i land use review 2hazardous vegetation and other emergencies significant vegetation may be removed without land use approval when the vegetation poses an immediate threat to life or safety or protection of property eg windstorm damage fallenover house road or

to provide basic and flexible standards for development of vehicle and bicycle parking the design of parking areas is critically important to the economic viability of some commercial areas pedestrian and driver safety the efficient and safe operation of adjoining streets and community image and livability historically some communities have required more parking than is necessary for some land uses paving extensive areas of land that could be put to better use because vehicle parking facilities occupy large amounts of land they must be planned and designed carefully to use the land efficiently minimize stormwater runoff and maintain the visual character of the community this chapter recognizes that each development has unique parking needs and provides a flexible approach for determining parking space requirements ie minimum and performancebased standards this chapter also provides standards for bicycle parking because many people use bicycles for recreation commuting and general transportation children as well as adults need safe and adequate spaces to park their bicycles throughout the community   applicability all developments subject to land use review or design review sdc including modifications to existing parking facilities must comply with the provisions of this chapter   automobile parking standards avehicle parking  minimum standards by use the number of required offstreet vehicle parking spaces is determined in accordance with the standards in table a or alternatively separate parking demand analysis as described in subsection a2 of this section 1where a use

city master plans apurpose the purpose of this section is to establish guidelines for encouraging citizen involvement during all phases of the master planning process by adequately engaging the public during the development and amendment of city master plans it is more likely that citizens will be aware of their existence understand their purpose and be knowledgeable about the issues they are addressing most importantly by encouraging citizens to be involved early in the master planning process community members will have the opportunity to influence what is contained in adopted master plans the following is intended to aid the master planning process but does not bind the city to perform every listed involvement method bcitizen involvement during the master plan scoping process citizens who have suggestions to improve public facilities services or outdated master plans are encouraged to present their ideas to city council andor city staff in writing andor verbally at regular council meetings suggestions submitted to city staff will be provided to the council during the council goal setting process for their consideration when city council directs staff to develop a master plan a kickoff meeting for the project should be scheduled and advertised the goal of the project kickofftown hall meeting should be to inform citizens that a master plan has been initiated what a master plan is why it is important future implications the plan could have on the community and to highlight ways citizens can be involved in the process after the project kickoff meeting a citizen involvement plan should be developed for the project ccitizen involvement during the development and amendment of draft master plans the following list of citizen involvement methods is not comprehensive and may be used for the development and amendment of master plans failure to conduct any or all of the listed methods or other methods does not constitute an appealable issue 1stakeholder interviews stakeholders are community members which are not serving on the project advisory committee but have a vested interest in the outcome of the master plan interviews of stakeholders could be conducted by phone or in person 2surveys questionnaires could be distributed by mail distributed at public meetings or be set up online 3public meetings at key milestones over the planning process city staff should host public meetings at key project milestones because each project will have unique information to communicate and different types of citizen input required the public meeting formats will vary formats may include workshops town hall meetings open houses presentations and discussion groups public meetings should be interactive whenever possible to ensure equal access to all community members the city of silverton should reasonably modify policiesprocedures and provide auxiliary aidsservices to persons with disabilities staff can also provide materials in other languages when requested 4private organization meetings and events when requested city staff should present master plan project information solicit input and participate in neighborhoodhoa meetings community association meetings and community events and festivals 5website the citys website should host a specific web page for each master plan under development or amendment the site will include an overview of the planning project meeting calendar project updates meeting agendas notes technical project documents frequently asked questions and answers and a summary of public comments received 6updates for planning commission and city council staff should provide regular updates regarding the plan and the citizen involvement process to gain planning commission and city council input 7community development department staff should provide regular updates to all individuals that participated in the planning process care should be taken to obtain contact information from everyone that provides comments or input on a master plan so that city staff can keep them updated with newsletters fact sheets and schedule changes the project advisory committee and other interested citizens should be sent status updates at the completion of each project milestone an ongoing record of citizen input shall be maintained and available to the public at city hall 8upon development or amendment of a draft master plan city staff should send a notice of public hearing before the planning commission and city council to all individuals who have participated in the planning process at least 20 days before each hearing staff should make a hard copy of the draft plan available for public viewing in the community development department notice of the hearings should also be sent to specifically affected areas this notice should contain general information about the master plan and capital projects exh a 2014  citizen involvement procedures for the implementation of master plans apurpose the purpose of this section is to establish procedures for encouraging citizen involvement during the implementation of capital projects identified in city master plans by adequately engaging the public during the implementation of public projects citizens will be able to understand the purpose of a project and the issues it will be addressing bcitizen involvement procedures utilizing city master plans developed with citizen input city council should approve a capital improvement plan that prioritizes projects listed in the master plan council could then identify projects during the budget process to allocate funds to construct the project projects that replace aging infrastructure provide a necessary increase in utility capacity address a health and safety issue provide routine maintenance and similar projects may provide an informational notice to residents near the project area in advance of construction when a decision has been made to move forward with a public project that affects the public interest such as a park or streetscape improvement project an open house type meeting should be publicly advertised to discuss the project with the community and citizens in the affected area the open house should inform citizens of specific project details and provide community members with the opportunity to publicly ask questions and provide comments on the project notice of the open house should also be sent to all individuals who have participated in the master planning process including members of the master plans project advisory committee city staff should present a summary of the open house public comments to city council so that they may consider refinement of the project scope or design once city council determines the final scope and design of a

district designation  dthe land is developed with more than one type of existing land use and more than one district designation is needed or requested  or ethe request for annexation involves more than two acres however if the community development director determines measuring the physical environmental and related social effects of the proposal will be similar in difficulty to that of a minor annexation a major annexation can follow the timeline for minor annexation 2minor annexation any annexation not meeting the description provided above for a major annexation and containing less than two acres is considered a minor annexation in general an annexation is considered minor if measurement of the physical environmental and related social effects is easier than a major annexation

the proposed area for annexation is to be residentially zoned there must be less than a fiveyear supply of vacant and redevelopable land in terms of dwelling units per acre within the current city limits redevelopable land means land zoned for residential use on which development has already occurred but on which due to present or expected market forces there exists the likelihood that existing development will be converted to more intensive residential uses during the planning period the fiveyear supply shall be determined from vacant and redevelopable land inventories and by the methodology for land need projections from the housing element of the comprehensive plan if there is more than a fiveyear supply but less than an eightyear supply the city may consider additional factors such as the likelihood of vacant parcels being developed in the near future to determine if the public good would be served by the annexation properties proposed for annexation that have a current or probable public health hazard due to lack of full city water or sanitary sewer may be exempt from this criterion  and npromotes the timely orderly and economic provision of public

criteria and city policy for the vacation of public land  adjustments and variances adjustment  purpose adjustment  procedure adjustment  review criteria variances  purpose variance  procedure regulations which may and may not be varied variance  review criteria appeals of adjustment and variance decisions  adjustment  purpose the adjustment review process provides a mechanism by which the director may make limited modifications to the application of regulations in the development code adjustment reviews provide limited flexibility for unusual situations while continuing to provide certainty and rapid processing for land use applications requests for changes from a numerical development standard of 10 percent or less of the standard are processed as adjustments requests for changes to standards which are not numeric or which are for more than 10 percent of the standard are processed as variances   adjustment  procedure adjustment requests are processed type ii procedure using the review criteria listed in sdc  in addition to the applicable requirements contained in sdc   adjustment  review criteria all adjustment requests will be approved if the director finds that the applicant has shown that the following criteria have been met athe requested adjustment is for 10 percent or less of the numerical development standard  bthe need for the requested adjustment is created by the configuration of an existing or proposed structure on the site  cthe need for the requested adjustment is created by the configuration of the existing lot boundaries or topography of the site  dthe design and operating characteristics of the proposed structure are reasonably compatible with the placement of surrounding development and land uses and any negative impacts have been sufficiently minimized  or eif more than one adjustment is being requested the cumulative effect of the adjustments will result in a project which is still consistent with the overall purpose of the applicable zoning district   variances  purpose this section provides standards and procedures for variances which are modifications to land use or development standards that are not otherwise permitted elsewhere in this code as exceptions to code standards this code cannot provide standards to fit every potential development situation the citys varied geography and complexities of land development require flexibility this chapter provides that flexibility while maintaining the purposes and intent of the code the variance procedure provides relief from specific code provisions when they have the unintended effect of preventing reasonable development in conformance with all other codes the variance procedure is intended to provide flexibility while ensuring that the purpose of each development standard is met variances are necessary when the applicant requests a deviation from numerical standards of more than 10 percent or a variance from nonnumerical development standards   variance  procedure a variance is processed as a type iii procedure using the review criteria listed in sdc  in addition to the applicable requirements contained in   regulations which may and may not be varied aunless listed in subsection b of this section all regulations in this code may be modified using the variance process bvariances are prohibited for the following items 1to allow a primary or accessory use that is not allowed within the zoning district 2as an exception to any restrictions on uses or development which contain the word prohibited 3as an exception to a threshold for a review such as the size of accessory structures 4as an exception to a definition or classification 5as an exception to the procedural steps of a procedure or to change assigned procedures   variance  review criteria the city shall approve an application for a variance if the review body finds that the applicant has shown that all of the following criteria have been met athe proposed variance will not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this code to any other applicable policies and standards and to other properties in the same zoning district or in the vicinity  ba hardship to development exists that is peculiar to the lot size or shape topography wetlands floodplains or other similar circumstances related to the property over which the applicant has no control and that are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity  cthe use proposed will be the same as permitted under this title and city standards will be maintained to the greatest extent that is reasonably possible while permitting reasonable economic use of the land  dexisting physical and natural systems such as but not limited to traffic drainage natural resources and parks will not be adversely affected any more than would occur if the development occurred as specified by the subject code standard  ethe hardship is not selfimposed  and fthe variance request is the minimum variance that would alleviate the hardship   appeals of adjustment and variance decisions appeals of adjustment and variance decisions shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of sdc as applicable
