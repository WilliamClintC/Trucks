scientific evidence indicates that there is a strong possibility that the resulting increase in ultraviolet radiation may already have caused an increase in the incidence of skin cancers and other

neptune by adding entitled stormwater management and entitled environmental impact statement be it ordained by the township committee of the township of neptune county of monmouth and state of new jersey as follows land development stormwater management is added as follows all text is new 5281 purpose a policy statement flood control groundwater recharge and pollutant reduction or low impact techniques shall be explored before relying on structural bmps structural bmps should be integrated with nonstructural stormwater management measures and proper maintenance plans nonstructural measures include both environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site source control plans should be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin nature and the anticipated loading of potential pollutants multiple stormwater management bmps may be necessary to achieve the established performance standards for water quality quantity and groundwater recharge b purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for major development c applicability this ordinance shall be applicable to any site plan or subdivision application that requires preliminary or final review after the effective date of the adoption of this ordinance major development that has received one of the following approvals pursuant to the municipal land use law preliminary or final site plan approval  final municipal building or construction permit  minor subdivision preliminary or final subdivision approval prior to the effective date of the adoption of this ordinance is exempt from the rules of this ordinance if any of the above approvals is amended revised or expires exemption shall be deemed void and the project in its entirety shall comply with the rules of this ordinance d compatibility with other permit and development approvals issued pursuant to this ordinance are to be considered an integral part of development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code rule act or ordinance in their interpretation and application the provisions of this ordinance shall be held to be  of 30 the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health safety and general welfare this ordinance is not intended to interfere with abrogate or annul any other ordinances rule or regulation statute or other provision of law except that where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance rule or regulation or other provision of law the more restrictive provisions or higher standards shall control e definitions for this found in 52812 definitions f this neptune township ordinance was based on the model draft model stormwater control municipalities proposed by the nj dep in njdepnj stormwater best management practices manualfeb 2004 appendix d at  www state nj us dep watershedmgt bmpmanualfeb2004 htm  5282 general standards a design and performance standards for stormwater management measures 1 stormwater management measures for major development shall be developed to meet the erosion control groundwater recharge stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality standards in this section to the maximum extent feasible these standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies into the design if these strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these standards structural stormwater management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design 2 the standards in this ordinance apply only to new major development and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain groundwater recharge the standards do not apply to new major development to the extent that alternative design and performance standards are applicable under a regional stormwater management plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with department rules such alternative standards shall provide at least as much protection from stormwaterrelated loss of groundwater recharge stormwater quantity and water quality impacts of major development projects as would be provided under the standards in this subchapter 3 for site improvements regulated under the residential site improvement standards rsis at njac5 21 the rsis shall apply in addition to this section except to the extent the rsis are superseded by this section or alternative standards applicable under a regional stormwater management plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with department rules  of 30 5283 stormwater management requirements for major development a the development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a major development b stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as documented in the departments landscape project or natural heritage database established under njsa 13 1b particularly helonias bullata swamp pink and or clemmys muhlnebergi bog turtle c the following linear development projects are exempt from the groundwater recharge stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality requirements at f and 5283g 1 the construction of an underground utility line provided that the disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion  2 the construction of an above ground utility line provided that the existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent practicable  and 3 the construction of a public pedestrian access such as a sidewalk or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet provided that the access is made of permeable material d a waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality requirements at f and 5283g may be obtained for the enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad  or the construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access provided that the following conditions are met 1 the applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the project that cannot be accomplished by any other means  2 the applicant demonstrates alternatives analysis that use of nonstructural and structural stormwater management strategies and measures the option selected complies with the requirements of f and 5283g to the maximum extent practicable  3 the applicant demonstrates that in order to meet the requirements at f and 5283g existing structures currently in use such as homes and buildings would need to be condemned  and  of 30 4 the applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other rights to areas including the potential to obtain or condemnation lands not falling under 528d3 above within the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream that would provide additional opportunities to mitigate for requirements of f and 5283g that were not achievable onsite e nonstructural stormwater management strategies 1 to the maximum extent practicable the standards in 5283f and 5283g shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies at 5283e into the design the applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated into the design of the project if the applicant contends that it is not feasible for engineering environmental or safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management measures identified in 5283e2 below into the design of a particular project the applicant shall identify the strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention 2 nonstructural stormwater management measures incorporated into site design shall a protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss  b minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the flow of runoff over impervious surfaces and lawns in excess of one 1 acre  c maximize the protection of natural drainage features and vegetation  d minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from preconstruction to post construction time of concentration is defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point of interest within a watershed  e minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading  f minimize soil compaction  g

not protrude further than the furthest point of the existing building line into that required yard area then the zoning official can issue the permit and no application to the board of adjustment is necessary the proposed addition must be equal to the existing building line but cannot exceed the same if it violates the setbacks b if a proposed vertical addition would be located within the

to rezone lots 13 and 1301 block 1405 from both r2 and b1 to r2 residential whereas it has come to the township committees attention that 01 of block 1405 are situated within both the r2 residential and b1 business zones  and whereas the property owner has requested that the township committee adjust the zoning as follows in order to remove the split zone condition on 01 and therefore these lots once subdivided and consolidated will lie entirely within the residential r2 zone  whereas specifically the owner will also be completing a minor subdivision and a lot consolidation redistributing the properties to add a portion of 01 to & 15 of block 1405 to allow for parking fencing and additional landscaping improvements on the subject commercial site completely within the b1 business zone  whereas specifically that the line between the r2 zone and b1 zone shall be relocated further toward the north to be coincident with the new rear property line of block 140 & 15 historically the zone line split is due to the subdivisions and redistribution of property in this area the zone line between r2 and b1 had run with the parcels due to subdivisions and consolidations  which is a splitzone which and is contrary to planning and not consistent with the 2000 neptune township master plan whereas the township committee acknowledges that the proposed change is not strictly consistent with the boundary line between the r2 residential zone and the b1 town commercial zone as identified in the 2000 neptune township master plan and the current neptune township zoning map the committee believes the this dimenimus change advances the interests of neptune township for the following reasons 1 the zoning map change will remove the current split lot zoning of both residential lots 13 and 1301 and block 1405  2 the zoning revision will increase the residential zone in this area and remove an existing split zone lot  3 as a result of the minor subdivision lot line change and lot consolidation the current flag lot configuration for existing lot 1301 will be removed flag lots are a discouraged lot configuration in the neptune township land development   4 as a result of the zoning map change additional offstreet parking fencing and landscaping will be provided for on the adjacent medical office use completely within the b1 zone appropriate utilization of a medical office use advances the land use and economic development objectives of the commercial corridor of route 33  5 the additional offstreet parking will reduce the potential for traffic impacts and congestion on the surrounding residential streets  6 the additional lot area fencing and landscaping for the medical office use will increase the separation between the existing medical office building and the current residential r2 zone boundary which advances the general planning objectives of the master plan  and 7 this will allow circulation around the medical office building which in turn promotes safety and traffic issues the proposed change is deminimus in terms of the overall r2 and b1 zones therefore be it ordained by the township committee of the township of neptune that the land development zoning map of the township of neptune be and are hereby amended as follow  upon completion of the minor subdivision and lot consolidation 01 of block 1405 will be removed from the current town commercial zone designation and rezoned in their entirety to r2 residential zone 2 the neptune township zoning map shall be revised accordingly 3 zoning map is amended and supplemented to add the following paragraph a 01 of block 1405 are rezoned from the split lot zoning r2 and b1 to r2 residential zone if any subsection paragraph or provision of this ordinance is declared to be invalid by a court of competent
