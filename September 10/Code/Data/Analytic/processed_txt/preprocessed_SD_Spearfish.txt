required in these areas when sites are consistently noncompliant with this code final stabilization requirements set forth in section 6105 are required for these sites      final stabilization 1all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and either of the two following criteria are met auniform eg evenly distributed without large bare areas perennial vegetative cover with a density of seventy percent 70% of the native background vegetative cover for the area has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures or bequivalent permanent stabilization measures such as the use of riprap retaining walls or geotextiles have been employed 2when background native vegetation naturally covers less than one hundred percent 100% of the ground the seventy percent 70% coverage criteria is adjusted as follows seventy percent 70% of the total area covered by native vegetation must have total cover for final stabilization for example if native vegetation covers fifty percent 50% of the ground thirtyfive percent 35% would require total cover for final stabilization in an area where limited vegetation is naturally found less stabilization will be required 3for individual lots in residential construction final stabilization means that either athe property ownercontractor has completed final stabilization as specified in this section under item 1 or bthe property ownercontractor has established adequate temporary stabilization including perimeter controls for an individual lot prior to occupation of the property by the new property owners and has informed the property owners of the need for and benefits of final stabilization a signed notice of stablizationrevegetation agreement form will acknowledge the landscaping requirements of the new owner 4for construction projects on land used for agricultural purposes eg pipelines across crop or range land staging areas for road construction etc final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural use areas disturbed that were not previously used for agricultural activities such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to a watercourse and areas which are not being returned to their preconstruction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization criteria 1 or 2 above 5final stabilization must be

of south dakota has in statutes sdcl  9291 and sdcl delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the common council of the city of spearfish south dakota does ordain as follows the city of spearfish south dakota elects to comply with the requirements of the national flood insurance act of 1968 pl 90488 as amended the national flood insurance program established in the aforesaid act provides that areas of the town having a special flood hazard be identified by the federal emergency management agency and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood hazard areas the national flood insurance program was broadened and modified with the passage of the flood disaster protection act of 1973 and other legislative measures it was further modified by the national flood insurance reform act of 1994 the national flood insurance program is administered by the federal emergency management agency a component of the us department of homeland security  findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the city of spearfish south dakota and that area of lawrence county administered by the city pursuant to the terms of a joint powers agreement between the city and lawrence county south dakota pursuant to resolution no 201125 are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions to specific areas by the following provisions designed 1to protect human life and health 2to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects 3to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 4to minimize prolonged business interruptions 5to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains 6to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas 7to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 8to ensure that those who occupy the areas of a floodplain for their actions  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities 2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters 4control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage 5prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other lands  intent athe national flood insurance program nfip was created by congress to reduce annual flood losses planning by communities and to provide property owners with affordable flood insurance in 197 the common council requested voluntary participation in the national flood insurance program and adopted the permanent program in 1981 bthe city recognizes the inherent flood risk of spearfish creek and other potential flood tributaries which flow city it recognizes the beneficial attributes of a national flood insurance program which protects existing and future structures within the flood area and insures against potential financial loss and bodily harm the city also recognizes the inherent constraints imposed by the flood insurance program which prohibit certain uses of property by its owners cthe city therefore is adopting the new changes to the permanent program with the following management objectives in mind as permitted by the federal emergency management agency 1manage with a minimum intent of flood control regulations 2apply minimum regulations to variance authority  ie allow construction within the floodplain fringe as long as it meets minimum regulations of the federal emergency management agency and does not increase the flood density or flood course 3by legal authority elects not to control the 500year flood area 4recognizes all architectural and engineering techniques approved by fema which provide for nondensity construction and floodproofing protection  article ii definitions definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application appeal means a request for a review of the common
