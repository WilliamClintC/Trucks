no instance shall a building elevation have a homogeneous facade without a variation in materials textures or other design features q maintenance repair and renovation of storefronts and facades 1 most downtown commercial buildings have large groundlevel openings storefronts framed by vertical piers and a horizontal supporting beam the storefront area generally includes an articulated entrance usually recessed display windows a paneled bulkhead under the display windows sometimes a transom over the storefront and a cornice that covers the horizontal beam the first floor should also have a separate entrance to the upper floors  112203 franklin code  112203  the upper floor facade of buildings in a downtown commercial district is generally characterized by evenly spaced windows that repeat on each floor finally there is often a cornice along the top of the facade which may be constructed of metal masonry or wood all of these elements must be considered when a commercial storefront is proposed for restoration or alteration or a new storefront is proposed for construction see figure 6 at the end of this chapter 2 usually the storefront and front facade has changed more than any other part of a commercial building as an array of business owners have sought to remain competitive the availability of steel beams for instance resulted in storefronts becoming more open as larger display windows were installed to attract customers unfortunately some changes may not be compatible with the design of the building or were accomplished with inexpensive materials that have not endured on the other hand some changes might be extremely good design in their own right and have enhanced the original building all maintenance and repair shall meet the following guidelines a retain and repair all elements materials and features that are original to the storefront and facade or are sensitive remodelings if feasible return a storefront andor front facade to its original configuration by restoring as many original elements as possible including windows cornice and decorative details this work should be based on pictorial research and exploratory demolition that has determined the original building design and condition if reconstruction is not possible any new storefront design should respect the character materials and design of the building in instances where alterations have acquired their own significance and contribute a positive visual quality to the building and the surrounding neighborhood they should be recognized and preserved b consider restoring any original window opening that has been covered filled in or altered c remove any materials elements and sign panels that cover display windows transoms or bulkheads and that obscure original architectural elements such as windows cornices or decorative features d avoid adding incompatible elements or materials such as coach lanterns overhanging roofs small paned windows wood shakes vertical siding or shutters on windows where they never previously existed e avoid creating a false historic appearance by remodeling a building with elements from an earlier period of construction

standards security grilles and rollup doors shall be designed according to the following standards 1 solid rolling service doors fabricated of interlocking slats or panels with no openings are extremely detrimental to an attractive streetscape and should be avoided no solid rolling service doors shall be installed so as to be visible from a public rightofway 2 if a security grille is absolutely necessary it should be a least 60% nonsolid the standard curtain pattern is a straight lattice design with horizontal rods at two inches on center and vertical links at nine inches on center for added visual interest a staggered brick pattern with 4 12 inch horizontal spacing may be preferable see figure 7 at the end of this chapter 3 the security grille coil whether side or overheadmounted should never be attached to the exterior of the building when the security grille is in the closed position it should be located on the interior side of the windows so as not to degrade the architectural design features along the streetscape 4 where headroom is limited a folding or accordion grille may be installed in lieu of the typical rollup type any sliding type security grille must also be nonsolid and situated on the interior side of the windows 5 an emergency egress feature should always be incorporated into the design and installation of any security grille

this article is to encourage and advance longterm economic vitality design standards to achieve a premium aesthetic appeal while discouraging less attractive layouts designs should contribute to an attractive commercial center creating a sound commercial community identity and inviting pedestrian interest and activity the following guidelines should be used in conjunction with other applicable ordinances in order to guide and facilitate the development of new and rehabilitated buildings a general objectives and goals 1 new commercial developments should minimize generic and corporate images but instead express the architectural elements and forms that best express the values and heritage of the community 2 minimize the dominance of parking surfaces and structures 3 use green space to soften parking lots 4 invite pedestrian access 5 encourage selection of appropriate vegetation and landscaping materials 6 promote safe ingress and egress 7 promote shared access b key design elements

with building architecture  1122061 franklin code  1122064   1122065 architectural design building composition refers to the overall design of a building its relationship to neighboring buildings and to the context of the overall development architectural design should promote a human scale create rhythms among neighboring buildings and encourage individual expression a site layout and building orientation 1 buildings or portions of buildings should be oriented on a site to create a strong relationship to adjacent structures providing visual continuity and compatibility within the overall development 2 linear development is discouraged however if it is unavoidable the development should incorporate design elements that significantly mitigate the linear effect 3 varying building setbacks to enhance visual interest along the streetscape is strongly recommended parking setbacks from all streets should allow for adequate visual buffering or screening 4 surrounding buildings or wrapping the project perimeter with parking lots especially along the street front is strongly discouraged 5 deep setbacks behind large parking lots or vacant land should be avoided  orienting some buildings closer to the street to screen parking in the interior of the site and provide stronger pedestrian connections to buildings is a more favorable alternative 6 multiple buildings in a single development project should be varied in size and mass a transition from low buildings at the site perimeter to larger and taller structures on interior of site is suggested b pad sites 1 the location and design of smaller freestanding buildings or pads can create a more inviting appearance in a larger development by visibly reducing the projects scale and by expanding the range of activities and businesses found within a single development 2 pad sites should be clustered together to define street edges and entry points or to enclose and create intriguing places between buildings c alternatives an applicant may submit an alternative development pattern provided such pattern achieves the intent of the above standards and this section d focal point required one or more focal points should be provided within larger scale developments  1122064 general provisions  1122065  within the context of pedestrianfriendly architecture important design considerations include building opening proportions height to width ratios and rooflines the design of new infill projects or the renovation or redevelopment of existing buildings should conform to the following guidelines and standards a building relationships and compatibility 1 create commercial developments with a contrast in massing ensure compatibility with surrounding developments to emphasize important corners and designate points of entry 2 avoid the boxlike bulky appearance of commercial buildings use varied materials textures andor colors or provide visual breaks standard franchise design elements or corporate architectural design plans for buildings and signs should be modified where necessary to conform to these guidelines to ensure that such elements are unobtrusive and secondary to the overall architectural design 3 building elevations must consider the character of the surrounding architecture and neighborhood and incorporate design elements to further enhance community character 4 linear strip development where unavoidable must incorporate variation in building height building mass roof forms and changes in wall planes in the architectural design to mitigate the linear effect in some instances a physical separation of one building into two or more buildings may be required particular attention should be made to building design when the building is adjacent to residential property or within direct public view of residential property 5 multiple buildings within a development must maintain a consistent stylearchitectural theme 6 entrances into buildings should be easily identified use of building design and detailing by incorporating projected or recessed entryways higher rooflines and changes in building material or color b storefront and facade design excellent storefront design enhances the pedestrian experience by creating a visually interesting streetscape showcasing merchandise and identifying the mix of goods and services such storefront design promotes individual businesses in ways that signs alone do not c consistency of materials use materials that complement existing buildings when freestanding walls are used to provide security screening and privacy color schemes must tie building elements together relate separate buildings within the same development to  1122065 franklin code  1122065   1122066 site access and circulation a pedestrian network that offers clear circulation paths from the parking areas to building entries creates a friendlier more inviting image by creating a safe continuous network of pedestrianbicycle pathways within and between developments pedestrians will feel more inclined to safely walk rather than drive between stores each other and must be used to enhance the architectural form of a building d energyconserving design applicants are encouraged to consider energyconserving design concepts including but not limited to the following 1 proper orientation and clustering of buildings to take advantage of the prevailing summer winds and to buffer against adverse winter wind conditions 2 types of material and their insulation characteristics 3 the arrangement and design of windows and doors 4 direct solar or photovoltaic energy 5 daylighting concepts 6 earth sheltering with creative land forming 7 natural ventilation of outdoor indoor and attic spaces a internal vehicle circulation 1 internal vehicle circulation patterns must provide a clear and direct path to the principal customer entrance of the primary building to outlying pad sites and to each parking area 2 in large commercial centers a clear system of main circulation drives containing few or no parking spaces that directly access the main drives must be established to carry the highest volumes of traffic within the site 3 in small commercial centers where traffic volumes are lower and pedestrianvehicular and vehicularvehicular conflicts are less likely more flexibility is available in the location and design of internal drives b vehicle connections with adjacent properties 1 accesspoints should provide continuous connections between adjacent nonresidential development parcels 2 common or shared service and delivery access should be provided between adjacent parcels andor buildings  1122065 general provisions  1122066   1122067 parking placing large amounts of parking between the front door of buildings and the adjacent street contributes to an unenthusiastic arrival experience for patrons and creates a detached relationship between the primary building and the street the scale of parking areas should be reduced by locating a portion of the parking lot out of view providing clear pedestrian circulation paths and amenity areas within parking areas and using increased landscaping within parking lots to screen spaces and reduce the overall visual impact of large parking areas minimizing the visual and physical dominance of the automobile is paramount for these design standards c onsite truck trafficloading and circulation loading and delivery facilities separate from customer parking and pedestrian areas d pedestrianbicycle access and circulation 1 bicycle parking is required 2 bikeways and pedestrian walkways should be separated and buffered from external and internal automobile circulation within parking lots pedestrians should feel comfortable that they are in a clearly defined pathway to the building 3 to enhance pedestrian safety and attractiveness of the walkway internal pedestrian walkways within a parking lot or drive area must be distinguished from the driving surface by use of pavers bricks integrally colored scored concrete or other acceptable methods as determined by the township 4 bicycle and pedestrian circulation must be provided from the perimeter of the site to all buildings and all sidewalk areas designated to accommodate pedestrian activity 5 where applicable planned bus stops must be shown on the plans bus stops must be linked with pedestrian

introduction a the redevelopment area that is the subject of this redevelopment plan is part of the greater renaissance 2000 planning area that encompasses seven us census block groups along the route 27 corridor in both franklin township and the city of new brunswick see exhibit 1 location map at the end of this chapter in 199 a public private partnership between franklin township the first baptist community development corporation the city of new brunswick and new brunswick tomorrow was announced to perform joint planning and redevelopment of the renaissance 2000 area in order to most effectively use resources in an area that was characterized by community disinvestment b later in 199 a consultant was hired to prepare a concept plan for the physical and social redevelopment of the renaissance 2000 area and in 199 more than 300 residents business owners and other stakeholders participated in a community review of that concept plan in 1995 the concept plan was finalized and approved by the renaissance 2000 executive committee a body consisting of the mayors of both franklin township and the city of new brunswick the franklin township manager the new brunswick director of planning and economic development the chairman of the board of first baptist community development corporation and the director of new brunswick tomorrow in 199 a majority of the renaissance 2000 area in franklin township was designated an area in need of redevelopment pursuant to the local redevelopment and housing law the lrhl njsa 40a12a1 et seq in 199 the development proposals contained in the 1995 plan were reviewed by the executive committee and revalidated c the basic revitalization strategy is to reinforce existing residential educational recreational cultural employment transportation and human services systems by adding needed new facilities jobs and services to create a balanced new community which will provide 1 a job opportunity or the opportunity to prepare for a job for every household 2 a continuum of housing choices mechanisms designed to allow individuals and families to move from starter units to full ownership to a retirement lifecare community 3 a continuum of learning opportunities for the preschool schoolage joboriented leisuretime and retirement learners range of public and private facilities and programs  112272 general provisions  112272   112273 statutory requirements according to state statute the redevelopment plan shall include an outline for the planning development redevelopment or rehabilitation of the project area sufficient to indicate 4 community recreation facilities focused on a new public park with program relationships with the public school churches other human services agencies and with local residential organizations 5 a business and industryfriendly environment in which existing businesses can expand and to which new businesses are attracted 6 design and use regulations and standards that protect and conserve the physical environment with full and active citizen participation in setting such standards and a review process in which citizens participate 7 transportation to provide access to employment recreational social and housing opportunities renaissance 2000 community revitalization plan june 1998 d despite the approval of a concept plan for the area the plan for the renaissance 2000 area was never formulated pursuant to requirements of the lrhl this redevelopment plan acts to incorporate the stillvalid recommendations of the 1995 renaissance 2000 plan and to plan the remainder of the area in franklin township pursuant to the lrhl a its relationship to definitive local objectives as to appropriate land uses density of population and improved traffic and public transportation public utilities recreational and community facilities and other public improvements b proposed land uses and building requirements in the project area c adequate provision for the temporary and permanent relocation as necessary of residents in the project area including an estimate of the extent to which decent safe and sanitary dwelling units affordable to displaced residents will be available to them in the existing local housing market d an identification of any property within the redevelopment area which is proposed to be acquired in accordance with the redevelopment plan e any significant relationship of the redevelopment plan to 1 the master plans of contiguous municipalities  2 the master plan of the county in which the municipality is located  and  112272 franklin code  112273   112274 current planning 3 the state development and redevelopment plan adopted pursuant to the state planning act pl 198 c 398 njsa a196 et seq a physical and social revitalization planning targeted within the renaissance 2000 has been ongoing for almost a decade this planning was begun at the grass roots level by several communitybased organizations that joined together in the early 1990s with the host municipalities to pool resources and to promote efficient consensusbased revitalization of the area the three principal nongovernmental organizations which operate within the renaissance 2000 area are 1 the first baptist community development corporation fbcdc a fbcdc is an offshoot of the first baptist church of lincoln gardens created in 1993 to serve the community educational and economic development programs fbcdc is the management entity for renaissance 2000 and essentially coordinates planning and human services activities in the renaissance 2000 area fbcdcs primary responsibilities in the renaissance 2000 area include  administration of and application for federal and state grants for projects in the area including uccrelated assistance  management of loan funds and programs including human services programs  intermediary in arranging project financing  review of project plans within the area  selection of projects for funding assistance  manage process of developer and design team selection and developer negotiation  coordination and consensus building of revitalization efforts between franklin township new brunswick and the residents of the area b fbcdc has created several subsidiary companies cdc properties inc manages the acquisition development redevelopment and sale of housing in the renaissance 2000 area this includes the renaissance 2000 affordable housing program the hampton club condominium complex redevelopment in the city of new brunswick management of affordable rental housing within the renaissance area and a special needs housing program focused on families affected by hivaids the renaissance community development  112273 general provisions  112274  credit union rcdcu works with area residents to develop their credit and increase their selfsufficiency the renaissance economic development holding corporation focuses its efforts on economic development within the renaissance area commercial ventures most recently the renaissance employment & training academy reta was created this entity provides basic skills computer literacy and industryspecific customized training to area residents and employees c the renaissance neighborhood association is managed by the fbcdc and plans to incorporate as a standalone entity within the next year this organization is comprised of residents business owners and employees and service providers from within the renaissance area 2 the antioch community development corporation the antioch cdc is an offshoot of the antioch christian church whose focus is residential development of the area surrounding antioch christian church in new brunswick 3 new brunswick tomorrow this organization focuses mainly on human capital development in the area b urban coordinating council neighborhood in march 199 the renaissance 2000 area was designated an urban coordinating council ucc neighborhood which provides the area with special technical assistance from the state and priority for competitive funding opportunities numerous other state agencies and departments have provided funding and technical assistance for the redevelopment and provision of human services in the area c community enhancement programs efforts in the area to improve social conditions and to revitalize the built environment of the renaissance 2000 area has yielded many community enhancement programs the following list is representative of the programs currently under operation in the redevelopment area funding and incentive programs for the area are contained in the project funding and incentives section of the plan 1 renaissance community development credit union provides access to credit for area residents and provides all general banking services 2 franklin township neighborhood preservation program encourages property maintenance within the community 3 community clean up program is a uccassisted program which provides institutionalized workers from the department of corrections to clean public areas within the area  112274 franklin code  112274   112275 plan principles 4 franklin township neighborhood police team provides two permanent police officers at the parkside community and established a satellite police station at the franklin township housing authority on parkside street the police team works closely with the parkside crime watch and citizen patrol 5 employment and training programs renaissance 2000 distance learning center renaissance 2000 employment initiative and green thumb 6 health and human service programs family support services center harvest of hope renaissance youth partnership program brothers working together men of tomorrow sisters circle young mothers program renaissance 2000 basketball league and other sports leagues school base program youth services program franklin child care program and parent infant care center a design 1 it is the paramount design goal of the redevelopment area to improve the visual environment and to promote neighborhood pride and public safety design strategies for visual improvement include employing standards such as setback building signage landscaping and prohibiting parking in front yard setbacks certain uses which typically require outdoor storage of products are not recommended to front on route 27 to limit their visual intrusion uses along franklin boulevard are recommended to have a similar design theme to make this entrance into franklin more of a gateway senior housing is recommended to be located adjacent to the existing williams park so that the park resource as well as the suburban bus lines station can be easily accessed by the senior residents 2 pedestrian safety and convenience is enhanced by bringing uses closer to the street and by requiring sidewalks of every development streetscape requirements also strive to enhance pedestrian areas 3 because the renaissance 2000 area spans two municipalities along a highway corridor it is recommended that design standards established herein be mirrored on the new brunswick side of the area particularly in the gateway area of route 27 and franklin boulevard where design is an important component of redevelopment b partnerships the partnerships forged during the initial planning of the renaissance 2000 area are strongly supported by this plan as are the creation of new partnerships not only is the partnership between  112274 general provisions  112275   112276 planning context fbcdc franklin township the city of new brunswick new brunswick tomorrow and antioch cdc crucial the continued support of the neighborhood council the residents business and property owners of the area as well as public and private entities is equally critical a location 1 the renaissance 2000 area is located along the somerset county middlesex county border in the adjoining municipalities of franklin township and the city of new brunswick along state route 27 see exhibit 1 location map at the end of this chapter the area is accessible from several roadways of regional importance including us route 1 route 27 route 206 and interstate route 287 2 the redevelopment area in franklin township that is the subject of this plan is approximately 156 acres in area and is located along route 27 which connects the area to edison woodbridge and points north and princeton to the south the city of new brunswick is directly adjacent to the area to the south of route 27 the redevelopment area spans the length of route 27 in franklin from the amtrak rail line south of churchill avenue to the franklin new brunswick border north of home street the northern boundary of the area is varied but is generally south of hamilton street b area description 1 the redevelopment area contains a mix of uses including singleand multifamily residential large and smallscale commercial industrial and public and institutional uses the industrial uses are generally concentrated at the western end of the area while the commercial uses are concentrated along route 27 residential uses are generally located along side streets that radiate from route 27 the first baptist church is within the area on route 27 between millstone road and stone place and naaman williams community park is located between parkside street and matilda avenue south of mark street a portion of the parkside community department of housing and urban development funded is also located within the redevelopment area 2 the following properties in the hamilton street sub area are deleted from the redevelopment plan

information the following population profile summary is descriptive of the entire renaissance 2000 area including the redevelopment area that is the subject of this plan 2 there are approximately 6850 people living in the renaissance 2000 area which is projected to decrease by 1% to 6770 by 2007 although the population is projected to decrease the number of households in renaissance 2000 is projected to increase from 1922 in 1990 to 2342 in 200 which is an increase of 22% alternatively the populations in franklin township and new brunswick are projected to increase over the seventeenyear period between 1990 and 2007 by 53% and 13% respectively while the number of households in franklin township and new  112276 general provisions  112276  brunswick as a whole is projected to increase by 59% and 9% respectively the seeming disparity between decrease in population and increase in number of households can perhaps be explained by the decrease in household size the number of persons per household is anticipated to decrease in the redevelopment area which follows a national trend 3 the current racial composition of renaissance 2000 is approximately 48% black according to us census standards 41% white 3% asian and 8% otherwise classified fourteen percent of the residents report hispanic origin the population of the area is anticipated to be comprised predominantly of workingage adults in 2007 65% while 21% of the population will be under 18 years of age and 14% over 65 years of age 4 educational attainment levels in the area are below state and local levels although over half 64% have attained a high school degree 18% of which have received a college degree average median household income in the area is projected to be approximately $58500 in 200 an increase of 24% over the 1990 figure d environmental considerations 1 wetlands and floodplains a although the area is relatively level in topography in general it is not significantly constrained by the presence of wetlands or floodplain there is only one water body in the area mile run brook which is located at the northern end of the redevelopment area north of home street limited floodplain parallels this water body b njdep freshwater wetlands maps for the area indicate the potential presence of several wetland areas only an areaspecific wetland delineation will determine the exact extent and location of wetlands and their resource classifications if any the preliminary wetlands line is depicted on the wetlands map96 2 site contamination a due to the current andor former industrial and commercial uses in the area the njdep site remediation program list of known contaminated sites in somerset county was reviewed and contains the following sites within the redevelopment area 96editors note see

industrial properties are necessary to determine the potential for contamination on such properties e area development projects several of the development projects recommended in the 1995 plan for the renaissance 2000 area are currently being implemented either or construction the projects are as follows 1 naaman williams park improvements it has been an ongoing recommendation of renaissance 2000 to upgrade and expand williams park to meet changing community needs the township is currently pursuing the recommendations and has retained a consultant to prepare a concept plan for the redesign of the park a preferred concept plan has been selected and will be modified to contain an expanded pavilion and tennis courts see exhibit 3 concept 1 at the end of this chapter the concept plan includes the following a the provision of offstreet parking for the adjacent parkside community  112276 general provisions  112276  b upgrade of the community pool c multiuse and softball fields d basketball and tennis courts e a fitness circuit path and totlot 2 first baptist church expansion another recommendation of renaissance 2000 was the expansion of the first baptist church and parking area the expansion is currently underway and will increase the capacity of the church and the parking area 3 parkside street realignment a a recommendation of renaissance 2000 to examine the realignment of parkside street to meet van dyke avenue across route 27 in new brunswick at a fourway controlled intersection was preliminarily investigated by a consultant retained by the township however due to public opposition expressed at neighborhood council meetings and planning concerns brought forth in the njdotsponsored route 27 renaissance 2000 corridor study for the area the appropriateness of this realignment was questioned and a stopwork order on the realignment was issued by the township council see appendix a97 b a somerset county economic improvement program grant application was received to study alternative alignments 4 other projects the plan is sensitive to current revitalization efforts in the area and supports any current efforts that are consistent with the goals and standards of this plan one development application has been identified as having either board approval or is under construction in or adjacent to the area a jumab pharmacy a proposed pharmacy on block 130 received final site plan approval from the franklin township planning board in april 1997 and is currently under construction the principal structure will have 3560 square feet of gross floor area will be one story in height and will access fuller street the property owner will dedicate eight feet of its franklin boulevard frontage to somerset county for rightofway purposes b utilities infrastructure  the redevelopment area is highly suitable for development due to its location along route 27 and its existing roadway and utilities infrastructure utilities available in the redevelopment area include public water 97editors note appendix a is on file in the clerks office  112276 franklin code  112276  and stormwater infrastructure public sewerage subsurface gas and aboveground electricity telephone and television cable service the water and sewerage lines are owned and maintained by franklin township gas and electric service is provided by pse&g telephone service by bell atlanticnj and television cable by tkr cable these utilities are located in the roadway rightofway  according to township officials the water stormwater and sewerage lines are adequate to meet the needs of future commercial operations eightinch diameter water mains are located along route 27 and franklin boulevard in the area sixinch water distribution lines service the adjacent streets domestic water is provided by the elizabethtown water co and sanitary wastes are collected by the middlesex county utilities authority c roadway infrastructure route 27renaissance 2000 corridor study  route 27 is an undivided fourlane state highway with no shoulders that has sidewalks on either side for the majority of its length in the area route 27 is characterized by heavy traffic volumes particularly in the southern portion of the roadway in franklin and new brunswick and is the host of aboveaverage accident specifically pedestrian levels in the renaissance 2000 area route 27 is heavily traveled and is perceived to be pedestrianunfriendly at best  traffic volumes during the evening peak hour have been recorded at 2250 vehicles at the intersection of route 27 and franklin boulevard which increases as one moves southward to 2864 vehicles at the intersection of route 27 and veronica avenue and decreases as one moves northward to 1595 vehicles at the intersection of route 27 and french street in new brunswick  njdot recently sponsored a study of the route 27 corridor in and around the renaissance 2000 area which recommends functional safety and aesthetic improvements throughout the area conceptual recommendations were presented and discussed with stakeholders in the renaissance 2000 area including representatives of franklin township the stakeholders support the recommendations as presented see resolution from township council in appendix a98 the goal of the study recommendations is 98editors note appendix a is on file in the clerks office  112276 general provisions  112276   to improve the ability of renaissance 2000 area residents to safely travel within the area and access destinations outside the area  to improve access to commercial and work destinations within the route 27 corridor  and to maintain regional mobility for thorough traffic while preventing such traffic from impairing the quality of life for renaissance 2000 residents route 27renaissance 2000 corridor study may 1999  the study recommends both aesthetic and circulation improvements including the promotion of pedestrian and bicyclist safety and increased linkages with the existing bus lines and bus station on route 27 the following improvements are recommended a roadway improvements i from french street to franklin boulevard two travel lanes with a center turning lane instead of four travel lanes is proposed the rightofway will accommodate a fourfoot wide sidewalk and a fivefoot wide panel for grass andor shade tree plantings a shoulderbike lane 45 feet wide will be provided on both sides of the street there is also the opportunity for special paving at leftturn locations and along pedestrian crosswalks ii from franklin boulevard to how lane four travel lanes with a center shared left turn lane are proposed driving lanes will be gradually increased between irving street and franklin boulevard so that four lanes are achieved west of franklin boulevard the rightofway will accommodate a fourfoot wide sidewalk and a threefoot wide panel for grass planting a threefoot wide shade tree easement will be obtained on the outside of the sidewalk area for shade tree plantings a fivefoot wide shoulderbike lane will be provided on both sides of the street b public transportation improvements locations for bus pullout areas areas recessed into the roadway rightof way have been identified in franklin at the franklin boulevard and route 27 intersection and at the douglas avenue and route 27 intersection in the redevelopment area c pedestrian improvements i sidewalk construction is proposed for the following roadways in the redevelopment area  112276 franklin code  112276  a both sides of franklin boulevard from route 27 to frank street b both sides of the new matilda avenue from route 27 to hamilton street c the west side of douglas avenue from route 27 to kathryn street ii the concept plan proposes installing a pedestrian light at the intersection of new matilda avenue and route 27 to connect the senior housing site in franklin with the suburban bus lines bus station in new brunswick iii the city of new brunswick has indicated that it will receive grant money to install sidewalks along route 27 in the vicinity of st peters cemetery iv the study recommends that the intersection of french street and

redevelopment objective to provide the most efficient and effective parking supply to meet the real parking demand and subsequently creating a genuinely pedestrianfriendly neighborhood the plan acknowledges that current trends support the theory that typical parking  112280 franklin code  112280  standards are significantly overstated recently the institute of transportation engineers has announced its support of shared parking or time of day parking standards shared public parking in one central location is inherently most efficient because fewer spaces are needed to meet the combined peak demand and each parking space is kept occupied for more time shared parking also allows visitors to park once and visit multiple destinations on foot  deviation from the rsis shall be accepted in this area there exists valuable potential for shared parking among the complementary uses it is contemplated that the proposed shared parking will optimize economies of scale by encouraging visiting singlecar tripsevents that have multiple business transactions further efficiency shall be achieved because residential tenants that park on site at night typically between  pm and  am take their cars to work elsewhere thus making those spaces available to meet the daytime demands of office retail and commercial tenants who typically require parking from  am to  pm therefore the deviation from the rsis standards to accommodate the shared parking model will result in the fulfillment of the parking demands of both residential and commercial users on one site  all required parking spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet wide by 18 feet deep the placement of the curb shall be permitted to extend into the required eighteenfoot depth of the parking space a maximum of two feet provided that there

above  all parking surfaces and structures should be located behind buildings fronting on franklin boulevard and the  112280 general provisions  112280  access to the parking shall not be allowed on franklin boulevard  surface parking within the mixed use district is intended primarily for the shoppers visiting the mixed use district business establishments parking at these spaces may be limited to a maximum number of hours to assure that the shoppers spaces are not occupied by cars parked all day  handicapped parking requirements shall be as per the applicable codes  each parcel and use is

redevelopment plans and areas map108 108 editors note these plans are on file in the clerks office  112283 general provisions  112283  1 henryoliver avenue redevelopment plan the primary objective of this plan is to revitalize the henryoliver district by removing all blighting conditions and influences therefrom including but not limited to those conditions and influences which have led to the stagnation andor unproductive use of lands providing for the productive utilization of cleared land areas redevelopment of same for their highest and best use and with uses which are compatible with a viable residential neighborhood which redevelopment may require removing all structures in a single area in order to provide for an integrated and compatible development  a this plan rezones the henryoliver avenues area from special development to c5c a highway commercial zoning district which permits highwayoriented uses such as office restaurants including driveins and bars retail uses

somerset redevelopment plan this plan covers the area roughly between camner avenue and the railroad rightofway along route 27 the 1995 redevelopment plan places this area in the hd highway development zoning district however this was amended to the c5c highway commercial district in december 1996 a portion of this property has been developed as the aldi food store offstreet parking is permitted in the front yard the goals of this plan are as follows a increase the utilization of hd highway development land by enhancing its attractiveness for retail usage b accommodate uses for vacant land that is likely to remain so without inclusion in a redevelopment plan c develop new businesses to provide goods and services to the adjacent community d relieve problems associated with dilapidated buildings by creating a situation conducive to retailcommercial redevelopment e create job opportunities for area residents via commercial development f to remedy the visual appearance of the land and thus enhance its value and the values of adjacent properties g design the development of the parcel to minimize the number of access points on to route 27 h maintain existing acceleration and deceleration lanes to and from the site on route 27 and look to their potential enhancement i install all utility lines underground to improve the aesthetic appearance of the area 3 edpas road

best use and with uses which are compatible with a viable residential neighborhood which redevelopment may require removing all structures in a single area in order to provide for an integrated and compatible development  a this plan governs the residential area to the rear of the foregoing two redevelopment areas in the city the plan places the area in the r6 multifamily zoning district and  112283 general provisions  112283  permits maximum residential densities of 28 units per acre in threestory structures b the citys zoning map places the majority of the remaining area not in city redevelopment areas across route 27 from the franklin redevelopment area in the r6 multifamily zoning district the r6 area includes st peters cemetery and the residential areas between the cemetery and quentin avenue and van dyke avenue and jennings court c the goals and objectives of the foregoing redevelopment plans are compatible with those of the franklin township plan in terms of design standards for uses although development standards in the franklin redevelopment area and the city zoning standards in the renaissance 2000 new brunswick area are generally compatible it is recommended that a joint design standard document be adopted by both municipalities to ensure consistent design particularly in the areas of signage the location of offstreet parking building design and landscaping f somerset county master plan 1 the 1987 somerset county master plan is structured to be the intermediary planning document between the state development and redevelopment plan and individual municipal master plans the redevelopment plan is consistent with the following goals of the 1987 county plan a to relate development activities to longrange trends and the essential utilities and services necessary to support future development in an economical and environmentally sound manner b to focus future development opportunities in and around logical areas of existing

historic preservation is an important priority within franklin township and the township has been aggressive in its efforts to preserve evidence of its long and rich history such efforts have resulted in the preservation of individual historic sites and numerous historic villages district designation preservationoriented development regulations creation of the townships historic preservation commission purchase of historic sites preservation of green belts around historical villages and the townships historic grant program b the d&r canal plays a particularly important role in the townships history the construction of the canal in the 19th century reinforced the townships important location in the region and the preponderance of historic sites and districts along the canal bears this out in fact a number of local state andor nationally designed historic districts are located along the canal in franklin and surrounding communities including the d&r canal historic district the kingston historic district the griggstown historic district the rocky hill historic district and the east millstone historic district as well as numerous individual sites and structures that tell the story of the canals importance to the history of the township and region c while efforts to preserve the townships history have been widely successful the condition of certain sites and structures in the townships historic areas negatively impact the townships heritage at the townships request three such areas were evaluated in the d&r canal area redevelopment study prepared by heyer gruel & associates in order to determine whether each qualified as an area in need of redevelopment pursuant to the local redevelopment housing law lrhl the three areas evaluated consisted of the stavola area block 8 lot 1 and block 9 lot 1  laurie rubber area block 60 block 2  7 8 and 10 and the franklin inn  onka bus area block 512 lot 4 based on the results of that study the planning board found that these three areas were indeed in need of redevelopment and that the redevelopment process could help facilitate the preservation of historic structures that are currently at risk following the planning boards findings the township council determined that these areas constituted areas in need of redevelopment d the three areas that are the subject of this redevelopment plan ie the stavola laurie rubber and franklin inn  onka bus areas indicated above are all located in designated historic districts adjacent to the delaware and raritan canal and the millstone river additionally all  112334 general provisions  112334   112335 contents of the redevelopment plan this redevelopment plan serves as the formal planning document for the revitalization andor redevelopment of these areas according to the lrhl the redevelopment plan shall include an outline for the planning development redevelopment or rehabilitation of the project area sufficient to indicate three areas are located along the millstone river valley byway a new jersey statedesignated scenic byway a corridor management plan is currently being prepared by njdot which will include a vision statement a visual survey of resources a survey of development along the byway safety and accident analyses a signage study and a multimodal usage study the strategic plan for the corridor will evaluate tourism opportunities provide a marketing plan and will provide summary recommendations for the corridor it is anticipated that the plans will provide recommendations for safety improvements along the byway the plans are estimated to be completed in spring 2006 e map 1 shows the locations of these areas within the township as a whole the location of the areas is shown in greater detail in maps 2 and  f map 2 shows the location of the stavola area consisting of two lots at the corner of old georgetown road and canal road both located within the delaware and raritan canal and rocky hill historic districts and each containing a structure of historic significance g the laurie rubber area shown on map 3 consists primarily of vacant property in east millstone that was formerly the site of a rubber factory and before that a gin mill the area is located within the delaware and raritan canal historic district and the east millstone historic district h the onka busfranklin inn area also shown on map 3 is located within the delaware and raritan canal historic district and just outside of the heart of the east millstone village the site consists of an automaintenance use and a historic inn the inn is an important historic resource dating to colonial times i this report is written pursuant to njsa 40a12a7 of the lrhl which provides that no redevelopment projects shall be undertaken or carried out except in accordance with a redevelopment plan adopted by ordinance of the municipal governing body upon its finding that the specifically delineated project area is located in an area in need of redevelopment or an area in need of rehabilitation or in both according to criteria set forth in or of pl 199 c79 njsa 40a12a5 or 40a12a14 as appropriate 117 editors note maps referenced are on file in the township clerks office  112334 franklin code  112335   112336 area description and analysis franklin township is a large and diverse community consisting of rural suburban and more urbanized areas the township consists of nearly 47 square miles with a population in 2000 of nearly 51000 the township is located in a triangle between three regional population and employment centers new brunswick to the east the bridgewatersomervilleraritan area to the north and the princeton corridor to the south as shown on map 1118 the three redevelopment areas are located in less developed portions of the township along its western border all the sites are located adjacent to the delaware and raritan canal state park the canal parallels the east bank of the millstone river which forms the western boundary of franklin township a its relationship to definitive local objectives as to appropriate land uses density of population and improved traffic and public transportation public utilities recreational and community facilities and other public improvements  b proposed land uses and building requirements in the area  c adequate provision for the temporary and permanent relocation as necessary of residents in the project area including an estimate of the extent to which decent safe and sanitary dwelling units affordable to displaced residents will be available to them in the existing local housing market  d an identification of any property within the redevelopment area which is proposed to be acquired in accordance with the redevelopment plan  e any significant relationship of the redevelopment plan to 1 the master plans of contiguous municipalities  2 the master plan of the county in which the municipality is located  and 3 the state development and redevelopment plan adopted pursuant to the state planning act pl 198 c 398 njsa a196 et seq a the stavola area 1 the stavola area shown on map 2 consists of two properties at the corner of canal road and old georgetown road located five miles from princeton and directly across the d&r canal and the millstone river from the borough of rocky hill the area is rural and characterized by steep slopes the area forms part of the designated rocky hill and d & r canal historic districts all of which are listed on the state and national register of historic 118 editors note said map is on file in the township clerks office  112335 general provisions  112336  places the structures on each of these lots were also found eligible for individual listing on the national register in a study conducted by ad marble associates in 2002 the structures on these lots are the last remaining remnants of a historic mill village located on the east side of the millstone river both have been used as rental residences in recent years but they are currently vacant and boarded up 2 the structure on block 8 lot 1 was constructed in the early 1700s is representative of 18th century dutch architecture and was associated with prominent landowning families in the area some of the walls of the structure on block 9 lot 1 were constructed possibly as early as the late 18th century though the structure has been largely rebuilt since that time the structure served as a saloon for mill workers and canal travelers in the late 19th century 3 the redevelopment study found that the areas historic significance is not being properly utilized for the furtherance of the public welfare the two residential buildings in the area are in a deteriorated condition rendering them substandard unsafe and unfit for occupation the redevelopment study found that because the buildings are unfit for occupation and because there are no barriers preventing access to the buildings the location of the subject buildings adjacent to the heavily used delaware & raritan canal park poses a threat to public safety for anyone entering the buildings however the redevelopment study found that the areas location adjacent to the canal and within designated historic districts provides an important opportunity for historic preservation 4 the development of these resources however is hindered by difficult topographical and site conditions and the years of neglect the sites have experienced block 8 lot 1 is an irregularly shaped onetenthacre lot occupying the crook created by the sharply angled intersection of old georgetown road and canal road the lot is located in the floodplain and has a steep slope on its east side block 9 lot 1 is four acres in size and is located opposite old georgetown road from block 8 lot 1 it consists of two sections a residential section and an agricultural section the residential section which contains the structure described above is in the floodplain the larger agricultural section of the property is located atop a steep slope located just east of the structure and is unused and contains some landscaping these constraints must be taken into account in the planning of the area further applications for development on lands near the delaware and raritan canal must be submitted to and receive a favorable approval from the delaware and raritan canal commission b laurie rubber area  112336 franklin code  112336  1 the laurie rubber area consists of several parcels of primarily vacant land in the historic east millstone community which consists of a roughly seventyacre village dating to the early 1800s the area is in a key location near the center of the historic east millstone community and adjacent to the d&r canal state park see map 3 the area is located within both the delaware and raritan canal historic district and the east millstone historic district both of which are listed on the state and national register of historic places the historic east millstone community is also located within one of the townships historic overlay zoning districts the laurie rubber area consists of block 60 block 62  7 8 and 10 2 the main parcel block 60 is located between the d&r canal and market street the parcel is the site of a former rubber factory that closed its operations in february 1983 though they were determined by the franklin township historic preservation commission to be historically significant the factory buildings deteriorated rapidly during the 1980s and were demolished in 1990 the main parcel block 60 is currently a vacant grassy field interspersed with young trees as discussed in the redevelopment study the propertys current bucolic appearance belies its long history as east millstones major industrial site as early as 184 mattresses were being produced on the site using a husking mill by 185 the site was being used as a distillery converting grain produced in the surrounding rural area into gin and also for the production of bakers yeast in 191 the facility was converted into a rubberrecycling factory which operated until february 198 just before the ecra environmental cleanup responsibility act went into effect an ecra file case no 84278 was opened on the facility in 1984 when it appeared the property was going to be sold the facility was found at the time to contain environmental contamination however the ecra case was closed when the sale fell significant deterioration had occurred at the facility which was found by the township office of fire prevention to pose an imminent health and safety hazard a demolition permit was issued in 199 and the site was cleared and cleaned to its current state while it is believed that some degree of environmental cleanup occurred the level of contamination that remains is unknown the unknown level of remaining contamination on the site has likely hindered its redevelopment 3 several parcels between market and williams streets are included in the laurie rubber area as well because they remain under common ownership with the main parcel most of these parcels are also vacant  however two of the parcels contain a garage and a storage building possible environmental contamination may have occurred on this property and has likely contributed to the lack of  112336 general provisions  112336  redevelopment an environmental study will need to be conducted prior to redevelopment 4 it is noted that applications for development on lands adjacent to the delaware and raritan canal must be submitted to and receive a favorable approval from the delaware and raritan canal commission the commissions requirements pose a substantial impediment to new construction in the area between market street and the canal and limit the amount of new construction that could take place elsewhere in the area c onka busfranklin inn area 1 the onka busfranklin inn area at 44 acres in size is located on the north side of amwell road across from the heart of the historic east millstone community and within the delaware and raritan canal historic district see map 3 the area is located adjacent to the d&r canal park and is across amwell road from a small park and several historic buildings currently used for retail and offices the onka busfranklin inn area consists of block 512 lot 4 2 the area contains a historic inn adjacent to the canal the inn has been documented on the historic american building survey reference no nj648 the twostory frame inn was originally constructed as a farmhouse in 1752 but was expanded into an inn during the 19th century the inn closed during the prohibition era and the property has been under its current ownership since the mid20th century since the 1960s the inn has housed a canoe rental service an antique store and is currently leased to the blackwells mills canal house association a small used bookstore is operated in the building on an intermittent basis the exterior of the inn appears to be in fair condition and has recently been scraped primed and repainted however damage to the interior has been recorded 3 the area includes a complex of much newer buildings located to the east of the inn that had recently served as a bus depot but now appears to be used primarily for vehicular maintenance and repair there is a gravel parking area between these newer buildings and the historic inn as well as a parking area in front of the newer buildings a large gravel yard on the east side of the property and visible from the village of east millstone is used for vehicle storage and additional parking the property formerly included a gas station and contained six underground oil storage tanks which were removed in 1991 an assessment of environmental contamination on the site would be needed if the site were to be redeveloped 4 the redevelopment study found that the presence of the bus depot use is deleterious to the surrounding community and the historic inn that its presence hinders the rehabilitation of the franklin inn  112336 franklin code  112336   112337 community input  112338 goals and objectives of the redevelopment plan maintaining the character of the townships existing historic villages eg griggstown and east millstone is one of the townships primary land use planning goals as reflected in the townships master plan this redevelopment plan is consistent with the master plans historic preservation goals and objectives and in fact is intended to achieve them with respect to these areas the primary goal of this redevelopment plan is the preservation and enhancement of the historic resources located in and around historic villages the specific intent and objectives related to the three areas follow and is harmful to the adjacent east millstone historic village and that the negative visual impacts from the use are visible from both the inn and the east millstone community 5 applications for development on lands adjacent to the canal must be submitted to and receive a favorable approval from the delaware and raritan canal commission the commissions requirements significantly limit the amount of new or additional development that could take place in the area a community input has been an important component of this redevelopment plan the township initiated an outreach effort designed to solicit input from residents in the surrounding areas property owners and community and historic preservation stakeholders the redevelopment plan was prepared based on the input received at those meetings as well as from the input of township representatives professional staff and consultants b at the onset of the preparation of this redevelopment plan the township council held an open public meeting during which interested residents and community stakeholders were welcome to offer their opinions regarding the planning of these three areas this meeting was very well attended and numerous people offered input in addition the township solicited and received written comments for a number of weeks following the public meeting the minutes of the public meeting and written input received can be found in the appendix119 c the township also held separate meetings with the states brownfields redevelopment interagency team brit and the delaware and raritan canal commission in order to fully understand redevelopment options in the three areas a stavola area the intent of this plan with respect to this area is the acquisition enhancement and preservation of the historic structures 119 editors note the appendix to the redevelopment study is on file in the township clerks office  112336 general provisions  112338  located on the two properties in the area the township intends to acquire the structures as the most direct and effective means of ensuring their preservation and enhancement after the structures are obtained the township will have the buildings secured with respect to vandalism and trespassing will seek to restore the exterior of the buildings in a manner that is appropriate to the historic context of each building and which will involve the removal of any modern appurtenances on the building exteriors preservation of these buildings is important as they represent the last remnants of a historic mill village located along the east side of the millstone river as a result it is intended that tours of the buildings could be conducted on a periodic basis in coordination with a nonprofit organization dedicated to historic preservation eg the meadows foundation b laurie rubber area the intent of the redevelopment area with respect to the laurie rubber area is the provision of open space and redevelopment that is consistent with scale and character of the historic east millstone village on the main parcel ie the land between market street and the canal the primary intent of the redevelopment plan is the provision of open space capitalizing on the parcels proximity to the canal although the plan allows for singlefamily development in accordance with the r10h district if such development were to be permitted by the d&r commission on the south side of market street the redevelopment plan calls for redevelopment that is consistent with the nature of the historic village consisting of singlefamily residential development in accordance with the requirements of the r10h district andor the adaptive reuse of the existing buildings for singlefamily residential or professional office use c franklin innonka bus area 1 the principal objective regarding the franklin inn  onka bus area are the preservation and restoration of the historic franklin inn building and the acquisition of the onka bus facility for the purposes of converting it to open space however if conversion of the onka site to open space is found to be infeasible than the objective would be the reuse of the onka bus building and site in a manner that is more compatible with the historic east millstone village and which capitalizes on and is more consistent with its location adjacent to the d&r canal if the onka bus facility is redeveloped the rear portion which adjoins colonial park would ideally be offered to the county for open space purposes 2 the objective regarding the franklin inn site is the restoration permanent preservation and continued maintenance of the building and surrounding area in a manner that stresses its unique historic relationship to the canal area in conjunction with the adjacent bridgetenders house in order to achieve this it is intended that the franklin inn would be separated from its current ownership acquisition this acquisition would involve subdivision of the existing site placing the franklin inn and onka  112338 franklin code  112338   112339 relationship to township land development regulations bus facilities on separate lots the franklin inn would then be managed by either the township or another entity interested in the preservation restoration and management of this historic building eg the meadows foundation which has expressed such interest the building would be used in a manner that is consistent with the historic nature of the building and surrounding area as indicated in the maps 4a and 4b120 parking would be provided to the rear of the inn for the purpose of serving visitors of the inn and the adjacent bridgetenders house 3 as indicated above it is intended that the onka bus facility would be put to open space use or reused in a manner that is more compatible with the surrounding area conversion of the onka bus site to open space is reflected in map 4a reuse and redevelopment of the onka bus facility would occur only if the following is provided such redevelopment is depicted on map 4b a provision of a larger natural buffer between the canal and the developed portion of the site  b reduction in the amount of impervious surface ie paved area  c

of planning goals and objectives for the township one of the principal themes that runs master plan most specifically in the land use element and the historic preservation element is the preservation of historic resources and historic villages one of the master plans key planning goals is preserving the character of the townships historic villages including east millstone and griggstown related master plan objectives consist of the following enhancing design standards for villages  discouraging the intrusion of incompatible uses  and maintaining the hard edge between villages and environs the new master plan currently under development continues the emphasis on historic preservation and maintenance of the character of the townships historic villages b as mentioned above these objectives of the master plan have guided the development of this redevelopment plan the relationship to plans of other agencies section below describes the relationship of the redevelopment plan to the master plans of contiguous municipalities and the county the state development and redevelopment plan and the planning policies of the delaware and raritan canal commission  112340 franklin code  112342  a state development and redevelopment plan 1 the redevelopment plan is consistent with andor implements the historic preservation goals policies and strategies of the state development and redevelopment plan sdrp as one might expect historic preservation is a key goal of the state development and redevelopment plan sdrp in fact historic preservation is addressed as part of the eight key goals of the sdrp in goal no 7 preserve and enhance areas with historic cultural scenic open space and recreational value as well the following is an sdrppolicy related to historic preservation protect enhance and where appropriate rehabilitate historic cultural and scenic resources by identifying evaluating and registering significant historic cultural and scenic landscapes districts structures buildings objects and sites and ensuring that new growth and development is compatible with historic cultural and scenic values 2 the sdrp suggests a number of potential strategies intended to help achieve the sdrps policy of enhancement preservation and use of historic assets including the adaptive reuse of historic buildings and the following a historic resources and development regulations protect the character of historic sites landscapes structures and areas planning flexible application of zoning ordinances construction codes and other development regulations b historic resources and infrastructure locate and design public and private capital improvements to protect historic resources and their settings from the immediate and cumulative effects of construction and maintenance of these improvements c identification and delineation of scenic and historic corridors participate in the coordination of state regional and local government identification and delineation of scenic and historic corridors throughout new jersey and take the necessary steps to protect them d greenways scenic and historic corridors establish within a regional greenway system publicly accessible portions of scenic and historic corridors to provide passive and active recreational and cultural opportunities e development patterns and design to support scenic and historic values manage development and redevelopment to maintain complement and enhance scenic and historic values within identified and delineated scenic and historic corridors  112342 general provisions  112342  f protection and preservation of scenic and historic corridors protect scenic and historic corridors by appropriate means and preserve them by using easement purchase density transfers feesimple purchase and other innovative and effective mechanisms g museums support museums libraries interpretive centers archives and other public buildings as repositories of past culture and showcases for contemporary culture and locate them in centers where appropriate as interconnected components of communitybased learning networks h economic development use historic preservation as a tool to promote economic development 3 the state development and redevelopment plan sdrp designates the township of franklin within a number of planning areas all three areas subject to this redevelopment plan are located in the statedesignated ruralenvironmentally sensitive planning area pa4b according to the sdrp this planning area consists of rural areas containing valuable ecosystems or wildlife habitats worthy or preservation the sdrp envisions that any development or redevelopment planned in ruralenvironmentally sensitive planning areas would respect the natural resources and environmentally sensitive features of the area with respect to historic preservation in ruralenvironmentally sensitive planning areas the state plan indicates the following specific policy objective encourage the preservation and adaptive reuse of historic or significant buildings historic and cultural sites neighborhoods and districts in ways that will not compromise either the historic resource or the ability for a center to develop or redevelop outside centers coordinate historic preservation needs with open space preservation efforts coordinate historic preservation with tourism efforts b delaware and raritan canal commission 1 the d&r canal commission is responsible for planning for the future of the delaware and raritan canal state park the canal commission sees an important role for the park that extends beyond its value as a water supply system and popular recreational destination the commission envisions the park as a spine for a network of preserved wildlife habitat and recreation sites that extends across central new jersey reaching into every community in the region and giving definition to the region by preserving corridors along these streams as well as other associated natural and historic sites the commission envisions a continuous network of open space and historic sites that will help assure the preservation of the physical and historic character of the region  112342 franklin code  112342  2 the commissions vision is reflected in the development plan for the delaware and raritan canal state park 20032013 adopted by the commission in february 2003 the development plan outlines 30 projects it wishes to implement in order to further the commissions principal planning objectives which include improved access to the park  restoration of canal parks historic structures  and provision of links to neighboring natural and historic places the development plan acknowledges that implementation of many of these projects will depend on the formation of partnerships with counties and municipalities with nonprofit environmental and historic organizations and where appropriate with corporations and businesses 3 two of the 30 projects identified in the commissions development plan directly relate to this redevelopment plan foremost the development plan seeks to establish a link to colonial park while colonial park adjoins the canal state park there is currently no connection between the parks since the towpath is located on the opposite side of the canal from colonial park connection of these two parks will further the commissions objective of providing a regional system of interconnected open space and recreation resources with the canal park serving as the spine the development plan identifies the construction of a pedestrian bridge possibly use of federal t21 funding as the potential means of providing this connection however with the recent expansion of colonial park involving lands adjoining the franklin innonka bus area opportunity exists to provide such a connection franklin innonka bus site this redevelopment plan calls for such a connection the genesis of this idea was the townships meeting with commission staff 4 another project potentially affected by this redevelopment plan is the planned restoration and reuse of the east millstone bridge tender house which is located immediately adjacent to the franklin inn but outside of the redevelopment area the development plan indicates that the bridge tender house is an important part of the canals history and that its restoration and use will increase the public appreciation of the canal as a historic resource the proposed restoration and reuse of the adjacent franklin inn site would be compatible with the commissions plans for the bridge tender house as would the planned improvement of the onka bus facility 5 preservation of the historic homes in the stavola area which represent last remaining remnants of a historic mill village is certainly consistent with the commissions objective of preserving historic resources along the canal the redevelopment plans proposals regarding the laurie rubber area ie redevelopment andor preservation consistent with the scale and character of the  112342 general provisions  112342  neighborhood are also consistent with the commissions planning objectives c somerset county 1 this redevelopment plan is consistent with and will help effectuate the planning goals expressed in the countys planning documents the somerset county master plan was adopted in 1987 a reexamination of the master plan took place in 1998 the protection and enhancement of historic cultural and archaeological sites and structures is identified as one of the key goals of the countys master plan other key goals include the preservation of agricultural areas and rural character and the provision of contiguous open space areas the plan outlines a number of policies implementation tools and planning strategies intended to further the countys planning goals the master plan identified increased public awareness supportive planning measures and financial incentives as key planning strategies for the protection and enhancement of historic cultural and archaeological sites and structures 2 somerset county is currently in the process of preparing a smart growth strategic plan sgsp the sgsp will serve to update the county master plan adopted in 1987 and the 1998 reexamination report the county has developed guiding principles and planning objectives as part of phase i of the sgsp initiative promotion of the countys historic heritage is among the many guiding principles already developed by the county along with other related items such as protection of natural systems  preservation of rural resource areas farmland and agriculture  and provision of a diverse interconnected system of preserved open space and a variety of recreational opportunities d adjacent municipalities 1 borough of rocky hill the stavola redevelopment area is located directly across the d&r canal and millstone river from the borough of rocky hill the rocky hill historic district which crosses the millstone river into franklin township was placed on the state and national registers of historic places in 1982 historic preservation is a key theme of the boroughs master plan the plan indicates that the perpetuation and protection of the boroughs historic character is of utmost importance to the planning goals of the borough the plan outlines a number of policies strategies and planning standards intended to further the countys planning goals principal to the boroughs vision is perpetuation of the historic development pattern and character via protection of the boroughs historic core and the retention of the lowdensity green belt surrounding it by preserving the historic development pattern and planning for the preservation of historic  112342 franklin code  112342   112343 administrative and procedural requirements structures the redevelopment plan is consistent with the rocky hill master plan 2 borough of millstone a the laurie rubber and onka busfranklin inn areas are located in the east millstone area of the township the east millstone area is located across the d&r canal and millstone river from the borough of millstone these two communities are separated from one another approximately 14 mile and are connected across the d&r canal and millstone river via the millstone causeway b historic preservation is important in millstone the area was settled during colonial times and played a significant role during the american revolution the construction of the delaware and raritan canal in the 19th century solidified its importance to the region a significant portion of the borough is located within a historic district placed on the state and national registers of historic places according to the boroughs vision plan 200 preservation of historic culturally and architecturally significant sites and important visual features play an important role in maintaining the historic small town character of millstone the borough is currently in the process of developing a new master plan that principally seeks to preserve and enhance the historic nature of millstone while addressing the boroughs affordable housing obligations and other planning objectives

governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored causes damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets bridges located in areas of special flood

safety risks in any way d in many retrofit situations it may not be possible to upgrade the stormwater management measure to meet all current groundwater recharge and stormwater quality and quantity standards  in this case mitigation will be required performance improvements for a range of retrofits must be evaluated to determine which one represents the optimum combination of effectiveness viability and cost as a result the final retrofit selected for an existing stormwater measure will have to be based on its relative rather than absolute effectiveness in such relative determinations both the costs and benefits of the evaluated retrofits become more influential factors then when an absolute performance standard is used e if a stormwater management measure is retrofit and the pollutant removal capability is increased it will also increase the rate and total volume of sediment trash debris and other stormwater pollutants that accumulate in the measure additionally the chemical or biological compositions of the sediment may be of significantly lower quality and potentially either more hazardous or toxic than the sediment previously captured finally the retrofit may increase the number and or complexity of components in an existing stormwater management measure thus increased staffing improved equipment and morespecialized training may be required to properly maintain the new retrofitted system the impacts of any increased inspections andor maintenance requirements should be determined and thoroughly evaluated f in addition to structural measures
