chapter shall be known as the san diego county transportation uniform mitigation fee program   2008  findings in adopting this chapter the city council of the city of el cajon finds and determines that a the city is a member agency of the san diego association of governments sandag a joint powers agency consisting of the city the county of san diego and the seventeen other cities situated in san diego county acting in concert the member agencies of sandag acting in their capacity as the san diego county regional transportation commission developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional system of highways and arterials in san diego county the regional arterial system could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee on future residential development as a member agency of sandag the city participated in the preparation of a certain rtcip impact fee nexus study dated  the nexus study prepared pursuant to california government et seq the mitigation fee act b the city council has been informed and advised and finds that future development within san diego county and the cities therein will result in traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the regional arterial system as it presently exists c the city council has been further informed and advised and finds that if the capacity of the regional arterial system is not enlarged the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of san diego county and the city with unacceptable levels of service throughout san diego county by 2030 d the city council has been further advised and so finds that funding in addition to those fees adopted pursuant to the nexus study will be inadequate to fund construction of the regional arterial system absent implementation of a regional transportation improvement plan rtip fee based on the nexus study existing and known future funding sources will be inadequate to provide necessary improvements to the regional arterial system resulting in an unacceptably high level of traffic congestion within and around san diego county and the city e the city council has reviewed the nexus study and finds that future development within the county and city will substantially adversely affect the regional arterial system and that unless such development contributes to the cost of improving the regional arterial system the regional arterial system will operate at unacceptable levels of service f the city council finds and determines that the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional arterial system within san diego county and the city will substantially impair the ability of public safety services police and fire to respond the failure to mitigate impacts on the regional arterial system will adversely affect the public health safety and welfare g the city council further finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the rtip fee and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety health and welfare of the residential and nonresidential users of the development projects on which the rtip fee will be levied h the city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional arterial system and the type of development projects on which the rtip fee is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential users of such projects to have access to the regional arterial system such development will benefit from the regional arterial system improvements and the burden of such development will be mitigated in part by the payment of the rtip fee i the city council further finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional arterial system improvements and that the amount of the rtip fee expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development j the city council further finds that the cost estimates set forth in the nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for the facilities that comprise the regional arterial system and that rtip fee program revenues to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share of these costs k the fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used to help pay for the construction and acquisition of the regional arterial system improvements identified in the nexus study the need for the improvements is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic thus creating the demand for the improvements l the city council finds that the nexus study proposes a fair and equitable method for distributing a portion of the unfunded costs of improvements to the regional arterial system m the

certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge 2 if f1 is satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of     variance procedure a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the planning commission to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare b procedure 1 in passing upon requests or variances the planning commission shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  f compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  g relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  h safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  i expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and j costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice from the floodplain administrator that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property c a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration of the federal emergency management agency 4 any person aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the city council in the manner provided in of this code c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if it would cause any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the planning commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the planning commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter 5 variances shall only be
