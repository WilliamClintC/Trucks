missouri in a of the missouri constitution and by the general assembly of the state of missouri in rsmo ch 89 2 findings of fact i flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of columbia missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare ii general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages iii the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this ordinance use standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for boone county missouri dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto  b calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood  c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point  d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height  and e delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the regulatory flood 3 purpose the purpose of the floodplain overlay district is to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in subsection 2 above and to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for

including adjacent streets and alleys and a shade study a shade study represents in graphic form the shade cast by the tall structure on adjacent properties and streets by time of day and by season an example of adverse impacts revealed by a shade study would be complete shading of rooftop solar panels mounted on an adjacent lower building a tall building may be approved by the city council if it satisfies the following criteria i the height is consistent with adopted city plan recommendations for maximum building height in the specific location  ii the additional height will not impair emergency response to the subject building or other places in the immediate vicinity in the opinion of the fire code official and chief of police  iii the additional height will not have an adverse impact on the availability of air and light to adjacent buildings and public streets  adequate spacing exists between the proposed building and openings in the walls of an adjacent building or between the proposed building and rooftop spaces used as amenities to allow the penetration of sunlight to those openings or rooftop spaces  iv the additional height will not create demand on any public utility or public infrastructure in excess of available capacity as concluded by an engineering analysis of the projected utility loads and the existing and planned capacities of infrastructure to accommodate it  and v public sidewalks crosswalks and streets adjacent to the site are of sufficient capacity to handle the anticipated pedestrian and vehicular traffic generated by the tall structure

mixeduse pedestrianoriented district  with a secondary focus on land uses property frontages and faades are part of the public realm literally forming the walls of the streetspace and are therefore subject to more regulation than the other portions of the private property the principal regulatory sections of the mdt district are the regulating plan the building form standards and the urban space standards described below a purpose and intent 1 the regulating plan the regulating plan applies mdt regulations to individual properties in the district it is public space master plan with specific information on development parameters for each parcel and shows how each lot relates to the streetspace and the surrounding neighborhood the regulating plan also identifies additional regulations andor opportunities for lots in specific locations as well as placespecific exceptions to the building form standards 2 the building form standards the building form standards bfs are coded street frontages they establish basic parameters governing building form for different locations shown on the regulating plan in order to shape the streetspace site and form controls on buildings their secondary intent is to ensure that the buildings are coordinated to form a functioning sustainable block structure throughout the district they describe the buildable envelope in three dimensions and certain permitted or required building elements that define the form and mixeduse character of the district the building form standards establish both the boundaries within which things may be done and specific things that must be done the street frontage designated on the regulating plan determines the applicable building form standard for a building site 3 the urban space standards the urban space standards establish those rules and standards for the streetspace and squares and greens within the mdt district that are the responsibility of the developer they establish an environment that encourages and facilitates pedestrian activity and walkable streets that are comfortable efficient safe and interesting and ensure the coherence of the streetspace b using the mdt district form standards this section describes how to apply the requirements of the mdt district to specific properties 1 look at the zoning map and determine if property in question is located within the mdt district if it is not then section 2942 is not applicable 2 look at the regulating plan in section 2942c and find the property in question note the color of the streetspace fronting the lotand then look at the key box to determine which building form standard frontage applies to the property note the required building line and the parking setback line 3 find the applicable individual building form standard in section 2942e the individual building form standard frontage will tell you the parameters for development on the lot in terms of height siting elements and use 4 additional regulations applicable to all properties in the mdt district are located in sections 2942d general building form standards and f urban space standards land uses parking requirements and signage standards that apply to the mdt district are found in article 3 and in sections 2943 and 2948 of this chapter c the regulating plan the regulating plan dated  as amended from time to time as provided herein is hereby adopted and approved by the council as the regulating plan for the mdt district the official copy of the regulating plan as amended shall be kept on file in the office of the director the regulating plan makes the mdt standards placespecific by describing where each building form standard applies and by defining the public spaces the regulating plan also identifies the items below as illustrated in the plan and key that follow  the boundaries for the district   existing and proposed streets and alleys   the required building lines parking setback lines and lot building limits 1 understanding the regulating plan the following images of the mdt district regulating plan and key are for illustrative purposes only contact the community development department for further information about the mdt district and shall maintain a copy of the regulating plan with the official zoning map the regulating plan key below highlights the regulations conveyed on the plan 2 streets blocks and alleys on the regulating plan i street connectivity and the pedestrianoriented public realm are fundamental characteristics of the mdt district when a property is developed or redeveloped a for largescale projects that involve a site that is the majority of a block or more applicants shall apply for an amendment to the regulating plan which may require the addition of new streets or alleys to create a smaller block pattern b no streets or alleys shown on the regulating plan may be removed without a replacement street being constructed in a location that maintains overall street connectivity in that area c new alleys or pedestrian pathways required by the regulating plan or a regulating plan amendment shall be public or publicly accessible d all lots shall share a frontage line with a public street ii block size is a key component of walkability for existing block faces of greater than three hundred fifty 350 feet in length at the time of redevelopment a the block face must be interrupted by an alley common drive or pedestrian pathway providing access to another public street alley common drive or designated conservation line b individual lots or development sites with up to one hundred fifty 150 feet of street frontage are exempt from the requirement to interrupt the block face c individual lots or development sites with more than one hundred fifty 150 feet of street frontage shall meet the requirement within the lot or site unless already satisfied within that block face iii curb cuts interfere with pedestrian movement and should be limited or removed to the extent possible during redevelopment a for lots with an alley accessible to service vehicles existing curb cuts shall be eliminated or vacated at the time of redevelopment unless the director in consultation with the department of public works determines that they are necessary to protect public safety or avoid traffic congestion or because alley access will not serve the functional needs of the property b for lots without alley access existing curb cuts may be maintained or relocated along the same frontage c where a parking structure is provided with at least thirty 30 percent of its spaces publically available existing curb cuts may be relocated or maintained to provide access to the structure even if the parcel has alley access iv alleys are a key component of mdt district connectivity and service infrastructure a alleys or common drives must provide automobile and service access to the rear of all lots except where the city has regulated alley access where lots abut nondevelopable lots or where a lot has streets on three sides and the absence of an alley or common drive would not deprive an adjacent neighbor of rear lot access b new alleys require an amendment to the regulating plan c for new alleys or common drives public access public utility and drainage shall be dedicated irrevocable easement d alleys may be incorporated into rear parking lots as standard drive aisles if crossaccess to all abutting properties is maintained e where an alley does not exist but is identified on the regulating plan and it is not feasible to construct the alley at the time of redevelopment no permanent structure shall be constructed on the proposed alley rightofway 3 regulating plan amendments any amendment or change to the regulating plan shall require the adoption of a revised regulating plan same procedures used for an amendment to the zoning map as described in chapter 6 procedures and enforcement of this d general building form standards the building forms detailed in this section establish the standards and parameters for new development and redevelopment within the mdt district the following standards apply to all building form standard frontages unless expressly stated otherwise within an individual building form standard or otherwise designated on the regulating plan 1 transitions when the building form standard designation shown on the regulating plan changes along a propertys required building line that property owner has the option of applying either building form standard for a maximum additional distance of up to eighty 80 feet

i the maximum length of individual faade compositions along a required building line generally running parallel to the fronting sidewalk for each building form standard is specified in the elements section of the individual building form standard frontage standards ii new buildings and new building faades are required to achieve a complete and discrete vertical faade composition along a street

for streets sidewalks and bikeways a purpose and intent 1 the 2025 transportation plan established a functional classification system consisting of major arterials minor arterials major collectors and neighborhood collectors in developing new design standards it was determined that local residential and local nonresidential streets should also be included this provides for an integrated street system 2 a roadway system must balance the conflicting goals of traffic movement and access to land arterials are primarily for the movement of   collectors provide equal attention to land access and   and local streets provide access to individual parcels of land at the expense of selecting the proper roadway design for each functional classification is vital to development of a system of roadways which provides the needed connectivity between all areas of the city as well as the capacity to handle future traffic volume 3 design elements encompassing rightofway width pavement width number of travel lanes bike lane width use of curb and gutter sidewalk and pedway width parking driveways buffer strip width and utility easements must be appropriately selected to provide the function character traffic volume and speed desired 4 major streets serve a development pattern that ranges from low density residential to intensely developed commercial centers and corridors to meet such varied conditions and address neighborhood livability factors requires an array of design approaches a one standard fits all is not consistent with traffic needs or the wide variety of situations encountered 5 in several of the street types an alternative design will be considered or may be required when conditions specified in the standards are found to exist this language was drafted specifically to allow a design appropriate for the land use and traffic conditions being created by a proposed development the alternative design may be requested by the developer or recommended by city staff or the commission criteria are included to provide guidance in selecting the proper street design to match the expected conditions if the alternative design exceeds the standard design for a particular street type it shall be presumed to satisfy these requirements in all other cases the final decision shall rest with the council b application of design standards 1 the design standards are intended to result in a more predictable and acceptable outcome for street improvements due to the wide range of circumstances however the standards need to be applied with a certain amount of flexibility street construction activity consists of building completely new streets as well as making minor improvements to existing streets many existing streets will not be changed at all in the next several years while others will be candidates for additional lanes intersection reconfiguration or major reconstruction unlike new streets existing streets have physical constraints to being retrofitted to meet new standards due to a narrow rightofway or the proximity of buildings utilities or mature trees additionally adjacent property owners often voice concern about more traffic speeding noise storm water runoff and other issues 2 to deal with the application of design standards two 2 categories of improvements have been developed major projects consist of significant improvements to the street system and the design standards are to be interpreted as requirements in situations where it is not feasible practical or desirable for a proposed street improvement to meet the required standards a design exception may be considered and approved by the council as part of the public hearing process major projects include i construction of a new street  ii major reconstruction of an existing street eg upgrade to city standards  and iii major widening of an existing street eg addition of one or more lanes 3 for minor improvements the design standards are regarded as a guideline rather than an absolute requirement in such cases if the standards are not attainable a design exception will not be required minor projects include i resurfacing or partial reconstruction of the pavement  ii installation of traffic calming devices  iii intersection improvements eg traffic signals turn lanes etc  iv reconstruction resulting in incidental widening  and v installing bike lanes or sidewalks on existing streets 4 major projects typically entail significant citizen input in evaluating location and design alternatives meetings are held with interested parties such as property owners and residents followed by public hearings by the council citizen input on minor projects varies 5 resurfacing usually involves public notice but little citizen involvement whereas traffic calming measures can entail extensive citizen participation in the location and design process 6 in regards to private development the proposed standards would normally only apply to undeveloped land that is being platted for the first time the standards could however apply to a previously developed area under two 2 circumstances i the area is being replatted to create a different street and lot layout for redevelopment and the construction of new buildings  or ii the area is being rezoned to allow more intensive development eg changing from residential to commercial and thus from residential to nonresidential streets 7 development occurring within the mdt district shall meet the mdt urban space standards section below unless otherwise approved by the director 8 a request for an exception to the design standards may be submitted at the time of preliminary plat review and shall be processed as a variance as provided by the subdivision regulations c local residential street design standards 1 residential streets provide direct access to residential dwellings and other allowed uses they should be designed for this intended function and exhibit characteristics which contribute to a safe and attractive living environment this can be achieved by providing a diversity of street types each serving a specific role rightofway and pavement widths less than the general standard should provide acceptable levels of access safety and convenience for all users including emergency service providers while enabling enhanced site design and creation of attractive streetscapes subdivision layouts should avoid the creation of pass for external traffic while allowing local drivers to move easily to and from higher order streets i the design standard for a typical residential street shall be as follows a rightofway fifty 50 feet wide  b pavement twentyeight 28 feet wide measured from back of curb  c turnarounds terminal streets shall have a turnaround at the closed end with an outside rightofway diameter of ninetyfour 94 feet and a roadway pavement diameter of seventysix 76 feet  d drainage curb and gutter system  e sidewalks five 5 feet wide on both sides constructed one foot inside the rightofway  f parking permitted on both sides of the street  g buffer strip five 5 feet wide with trees permitted in the rightofway subject to compliance with city policies and regulations  and h utility easements ten 10 feet on both sides adjacent to the rightofway the city and public utility providers will not be responsible for the restoration of any landscaping placed within utility easements that is removed or damaged as a result of constructing repairing or maintaining public utilities ii in place of the typical residential

streets and other public and publicly accessible spaces 2 the urban space standards establish the rules and standards for the street space and squares and greens within the mdt district b intent 1 mdt district properties are coded to be perimeter blocks with buildings placed along the outer edges of their block the urban space standards ensure the coherence and appropriateness of the streetspace 2 although commonly thought of as just squares greens or parks the public realm is much more  it includes the complete streetspacethe public domain between the building facades the travel lanes between the curbs as well as the sidewalks  the squares and greens within the mdt district 3 the urban space standards i establish an environment that encourages and facilitates pedestrian activity and walkable streets that are comfortable efficient safe and interesting  ii ensure the coherence of the streetspace serving to assist residents building owners and managers with understanding the relationship between the streetspace and their own property  and iii contribute to ultimate sustainability native trees and plants contribute to privacy the reduction of noise and air pollution shade maintenance of the natural habitat conservation of water and rainwater management 4 property frontages and facades are part of the public realm literally forming the walls of the streetspace and are therefore subject to more regulation than the other portions of the private property 5 the private interior portions of the lots toward the alley rear lot or lot lines are less controlled to allow residents and operators to utilize these spaces as environments unseen by the public and allow residents to have private open space semiprivate for apartment and condominium dwellers gardens and courtyards c streetspace standards 1 general provisions i all plant material including trees shall be in accordance with the requirements of article 4 of this ii mechanical and electrical equipment including but not limited to the following may not be stored or located within any street space  air compressors  pumps  exterior water heaters  water softeners  private garbage cans not including public sidewalk waste bins and  storage tanks water pumps for public fountains or irrigation not visible are not included in the prohibition of location of equipment within any street space and temporary placement of private garbage cans within the streetspace may be allowed to accommodate scheduled pickup 2 street trees i each streetspace must have street trees planted along the street tree alignment line generally in the centerline of the tree lawn or not less than three 3 feet from the back of the curb unless otherwise specified in the regulating plan and at an average spacing not greater than thirty 30 feet on center average calculated per block face where necessary spacing allowances may be made to accommodate curb cuts and infrastructure elements  however at no location may street tree spacing exceed fortyfive 45 feet on center except where necessary for transit stops or stations required street tree planting area configurations are specified in the street type specifications and below ii required tree planting area minimum specifications are as follows a street tree planting areas shall be at grade or not greater than six 6 inches in height above the sidewalk  b soil surface area shall not be less than one hundred ten 110 square feet per isolated tree or ninety 90 square feet per tree for connected tree lawn situations as illustrated in the following figures  figure a1 continuous soil area configuration options low pedestrian traffic areas left high pedestrian traffic areas right figure a2 individual tree planting c no dimension of the soil surface area may be less than six 6 feet unless otherwise specified in this chapter  d a pervious paving strip maximum twelve 12 inches wide may be placed at the back of the curb for access to onstreet parking this pervious strip is not measured against the required soil surface area  and e the streetspace types are configured for street tree trenches connected soil areas the above requirements may be met use of bridged slab structural soil or other techniques that clearly exceed these standards in the fostering of vital and longlived street trees see figure a1 iii at planting street trees shall be at least three and a half 35 inches caliper measured four 4 feet above grade and at least ten 10 feet in overall height species shall be selected from the street tree list set forth herein consult with the director for the designated tree species for a particular streetspace iv any unpaved ground area shall be planted with ground cover flowering vegetation or climbing vines not to exceed twelve 12 inches in maturity so as to not interfere with pedestrian or truck travel minimum seven 7 feet clear over the sidewalk and fourteen 14 feet over any travel lanes and to maintain visibility 3 street tree specifications i species in the street tree list are for placement as shown in street type specifications or as specified in the regulating plan for placement along a street tree alignment line the use of alternate species may be permitted but only if approved by the director ii street trees are part of an overall streetspace plan designed to provide both canopy and shade and to give special character and coherence to each street the desired aesthetic shall be achieved use of native andor proven hardy adapted species the list of appropriate street tree species may change over time and will be periodically amended by the director inclusion in this list shall be based on the following criteria a structural street trees shape and subdivide the streetspace increasing pedestrian comfort and adding literal value to the streetcommunity canopy shade tree species grow to heights in excess of sixty 60 feet and have a broad canopyenabling the trees to clear auto and pedestrian traffic form a ceilinglike enclosure and open a clear view of the streetspace at eyelevel b tree survivability proper planting techniques and configurations provide a healthy environment in which the street tree can thrivethis will ensure that the trees increase their value to the community as they grow c form species are planted consistently along a given streetspace to provide a special form and character this provides species diversity among streets at the same time it provides a specific street character by planting different streetspaces with different tree 4 street tree list i invasive species as identified by the missouri department of conservations invasive species list are prohibited ii the following list contains all approved tree species large canopy trees with a mature height of sixty 60 feet and above for use in the mdt district the list may include native and acceptable adapted species species marked with an asterisk may be

walkway not less than ten 10 feet wide providing an unobstructed view straight entire length except where otherwise specified on the regulating plan d streetspace recommendations 1 intent i the streetspace is a communitys first and foremost public space and should be just as carefully designed and planned as any park or public building the character of the streetspaceboth its scale and its detailsplays a critical role in determining the pedestrian quality of a given location ii streetspaces must balance the needs of all forms of trafficauto transit bicycle and pedestrianto maximize mobility and convenience for all residents and users their character will vary depending on their location some streets will carry a large volume of traffic and provide a more active and intense urban pedestrian experience while others will provide a less active and more intimately scaled streetspace iii these are city streetsnot roads highways arterials or collectorsand must be developed as such to create peopleoriented places balancing all transportation modes the neighborhood streetspaces are designed primarily for walkability and pedestrian comfort with automobile movement as a secondary focus the specifications for major streets grant more to the free movement of vehicles while maintaining good walkability 2 street design principles i the appropriate design of streets is one of the most important design elements for a downtown area ii to design for continuous freeflowing traffic creates situations where vehicles will travel at speeds greater than desirable for pedestrians iii with appropriate design techniques drivers shall choose slower speeds and less aggressive behavior a feat typically not achieved speed limit signagepostings iv scale is a threshold design consideration for street design elements from signage to crossing distancesin a downtown area it should be that of the pedestrian v an interconnected street network allows traffic capacity to be diffused and maintained across numerous streets vi emergency vehicle access shall be maintained but with an interconnected street network there shall always be at least two 2 routes of access to any lot or parcel vii differences between requirements and preferences can be significantincreased lane width and the accompanying increased vehicle speeds more often than not decrease overall safety for pedestrians viii onstreet parking slows passing vehicular traffic and acts as a buffer between moving vehicles and pedestrians ix overall function comfort safety and aesthetics of a street are more important than efficiency alone x in a downtown area nonvehicular traffic should be provided with every practical advantage so long as safety is not adversely affected xi street design should take into consideration what is reasonably foreseeable not every situation that is conceivably possible xii designing a street to facilitate rather than accommodate infrequent users may actually be the wrong design for the frequent users of the space xiii when the street design creates a conflict between the vehicular and nonvehicular user it should be resolved in favor of the nonvehicular user 3
