property values and the general welfare of this community are founded in part upon the appearance and maintenance of properties b there now appears the need for further emphasis on the maintenance of public and private property in a clean litterfree and debrisfree condition because locations throughout the town have been found to have been the site of littering illegal dumping and accumulated garbage refuse and rubbish c that the existence of such conditions is injurious and inimical to the public health safety and welfare of the residents of this town and contributes substantially and increasingly to the problems of the necessity for expenditure for protection against hazards and diminution of property values and the preservation of the public health safety and welfare and that such problems are becoming increasingly direct and substantial in significance  and that the uses and abuses of property as described herein reasonable relate to the proper exercise of the inspection power in the protection of health safety and welfare of the public d that unless corrective measures are taken to alleviate such existing conditions and particularly to avoid future problems in this regard the public health safety and general welfare and specifically the property values and social and economic standards of this community will be depreciated  that the elimination of such conditions will enhance the appearance and value of such properties rather than be a burden on the owners thereof  and that elimination of such conditions will also appreciate the values and appearance of neighboring properties and benefit the use and enjoyment of properties in the general area and will improve the general welfare and image of the town  maintenance of areas around

discharge rate for the 100year storm to mitigate downstream impacts c discharge from any storm water facility must be conveyed constructed conveyance system to provide for nonerosive flows during all storm events the proposed storm water conveyance system consisting of open channels pipes and other conveyance devices shall at a minimum accommodate the runoff from a 25year storm event the storm water conveyance system must provide for nonerosive flows to receiving waters 5 surface water and groundwater storm water management plans shall in accordance with the state storm water design and installation standards manual as amended demonstrate that during development and postdevelopment all receiving waters will be recharged in a manner closely resembling predevelopment conditions and that the developed site will retain hydrological conditions that closely resemble of those prior to disturbance the goal of the storm water design shall be that hydrologic conditions in each subwatershed match predevelopment conditions where practicable development and redevelopment projects should aim to reduce runoff volumes this may include minimizing and eliminating impervious surface areas such as roads parking paving or other surfaces encouraging infiltration of noncontaminated runoff preventing channelization encouraging sheet flow and where appropriate preserving enhancing or establishing buffers along surface water bodies and tributaries  storm water management plans a the drainage plan storm drainage calculations runoff rates and system design shall be based on the application of the appropriate method as follows the rational method this method is the preferred method for small systems of three acres or less when no wetlands ponds or other storage depressions are present and where drainage is toward the point of analysis tr55 this is the preferred method for calculating runoff volumes peak discharge rate and flood storage requirements for site development between one acre and 2000 acres tr20 this is for large complex watersheds and systems beyond the scope of tr55 the drainage plan and drainage calculations shall contain the following information 1 an estimate of the quantity of stormwater surface runoff presently flowing from the land proposed to be subdivided and that which would be generated by the proposed subdivision calculated on the basis of a 25year frequency rainfall 2 an estimate of the quantity of stormwater surface runoff entering the subdivision naturally from upstream areas within the watershed under present conditions calculated on the basis of a 25year frequency rainfall 3 an analysis of the capability of existing watercourses storm sewers culverts and other drainage facilities within the land proposed to be subdivided to handle the runoff as calculated under 1 and 2 above and proposals to handle such surface runoff culvert and storm sewers shall be designed for a 25year frequency rainfall with a minimum pipe size of 15 inches and a minimum pipe gradient of one percent 4 proposals for disposal of surface runoff downstream from the subdivision without damage to the land and improvements and to the receiving water

depending on grades and soil types  e that a continuous drainage system will be installed and connected to a natural or manmade watercourse or to an existing pipe storm drainage system whenever feasible such drainage system shall be designed as a nonstructural system consisting of swales sheet flow and open drainage which attenuates nonpoint pollution and regulates the rate of flow the ultimate destination of such continuous drainage shall be a permanent natural body of water or wetland when the planning board determines that such ultimate destination is impractical the board shall require the construction of a retention area capable of accommodating proposed stormwater volumes based on a twoyear 25year and 100year frequency rainfall f when any part of the drainage system is proposed for location outside the public street rightofway provisions for future maintenance approved by the planning board and town engineering department will be provided  g that all necessary easements to offstreet watercourses will be obtained by the subdivided  h where volume velocity of the surface runoff is high the flow therefore shall be controlled by riprap sediment basins flow
