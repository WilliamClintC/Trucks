stormwater utility authority the town is authorized by virginia  1522114 to enact a system of utility fees to support a local stormwater management program consistent with the virginia stormwater management act virginia title 621 144 et seq and all other state or federal regulations governing stormwater management  findings and purpose the purpose of this article is to establish a stormwater utility and impose stormwater utility fees to fund compliance with state and federal regulations pertaining to stormwater management and maintenance of the towns stormwater infrastructure the town council finds that an adequate and sustainable source of revenue for its stormwater management activities is necessary to protect the general health safety and welfare of the residents of the town and that the towns stormwater management program benefits properties within the town of flooding improvement of water quality and protection of the towns natural environment council recognizes that stormwater runoff is associated with all improved properties in the town whether residential or nonresidential and the quantity and quality of runoff is typically correlated to the amount of impervious surface and landdisturbing activities on the property further the council finds that properties with higher amounts of impervious area contribute greater amounts of stormwater and pollutants to the waters of the commonwealth and should carry a proportionate burden of the cost of the towns stormwater management program the council also recognizes that all property owners of developed properties have a responsibility to contribute to program costs by providing funding for necessary stormwater infrastructure upgrades that reduce pollutants that enter the waters of the commonwealth protect and restore streams and other aquatic habitat areas collect and convey stormwater safely parts of the town and comply with federal and state regulations for water quality improvements therefore council determines that it is in the best interest of the public to establish a stormwater utility and impose stormwater utility fees on all town property owners andor their tenants that to the extent practicable allocates program costs on an equitable and rational basis related to the amount of impervious area located on their property  definitions the following words

article is to regulate the size color illumination movement materials location height and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation to protect property values and the character of neighborhoods  create a convenient attractive and harmonious community  protect against the destruction of or encroachment upon areas of historic significance  and ensuring the safety and

establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land the building or the use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in subsection a of this section d these regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant and the landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain are not distracting to motorists and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition e these regulations distinguish between portions of the town designed for primarily vehicular access and portions of the town designed for primarily pedestrian access f these regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs rather they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs  definitions the following words terms and phrases when
