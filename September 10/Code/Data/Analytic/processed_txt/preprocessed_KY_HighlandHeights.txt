phasing of the zoning of an area is especially critical to the implementation of the adopted comprehensive plan the intent of the phased zoning regulations is to encourage development or redevelopment or a specified area for the used andor density designated on the comprehensive plan when the necessary conditions for such development are realized eg demolition of existing deteriorated areas implicit in such a phased zoning approach is the premise that until such conditions are realized the type of development identified by the comprehensive plan is premature  such development would be prevented by temporarily zoning the area to generally conform with the predominant existing land use with a clear stipulation of an intended future rezoning which would be in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan b the phased zoning regulations may be overlaid over any zoning classification by means of a conventional zone change process the use of the phased zoning regulations would indicate that the regulations of the overlaid zone are currently being enforced based upon the general existing land use but on attainment of all the requirements of the zone which corresponds to the adopted comprehensive plan for type of use andor density and other requirements of this ordinance the area could be rezoned in direct compliance with the plan c phased zones are indicated on the official zoning map by adding to the overlaid zone the letter p as a suffix enclosed in parenthesis for example in order to properly phase its redevelopment an area zone r1e reflecting the existing singlefamily development which is identified as future multifamily residential development on the locally adopted comprehensive plan could be temporarily zoned r1e p indicating that present development on the site would be in conformance with the regulations of the overlaid r 1e zone but that when efforts are possible to redevelop the entire area or a significant portion of the area in a coordinated and comprehensive fashion the area could be rezoned conventional zone change procedure at the time of the zone change general regulations 923 highland heights zoning nkapc the temporary r1e p zone is removed and the area is developed according to the regulations of the new zone which is in conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan d the minimum size of any area to be rezoned as regulated by this section of the ordinance is five 5 acres provided that all other provisions of this ordinance and the citys subdivision regulations are adhered to development of a smaller tract

and incorporated into public and private infrastructure and geotechnical exploration and earthwork construction requirements 481 purpose pavement in public streets including subdivision streets is one of the largest physical assets by dollar value owned by various kenton county legislative bodies citycounty the purpose of this section is twofold the first is to inform all in kenton county who have responsibilities in the design construction and maintenance of subdivision streets of important facts about the nature of pavements and their individual responsibilities in obtaining good longterm pavement performance in new kenton county subdivisions the second is to set out some of the critical engineering analysis and reasoning used to establish the pavement pavement subgrade and pavement drainage specifications for future subdivision pavement contained in public and private infrastructure  pavement design method and required thicknesses 7 asphalt concrete asphalt paving mixture and construction specifications and geotechnical exploration and earthwork construction requirements of these regulations kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design existing subdivision pavement 482 performance analysis during the process of reviewing this 2014 update of the kenton county subdivision regulations there was a substantial community discussion on subdivision pavement design construction and performance during the late stages of this community discussion at the suggestion of the kenton county judge executive and several city mayors and authorization of the planning commission chairman a committee of five local pavement professionals with extensive and longterm experience in the design construction and maintenance of subdivision pavements was formed this committee was asked as a voluntary community service to do the following analyze existing subdivision pavement performance evaluate that performance compared to reasonable expectations for pavement performance and make recommendations that would improve pavement customer value in future subdivision pavements all earlier community discussion on pavement performance was to be considered as input into their process appendix c engineers committee final report contains this committees final report to the planning commission in this regard the recommendations of this report were an important source of information that was used in the formation of these subdivision pavement regulations 483 important pavement facts there is no perfect pavement no pavement lasts indefinitely and all pavements require maintenance repair and refurbishment on a timely basis in order to minimize long term pavement costs all professional pavement design procedures recognize that all pavements will eventually fail regardless of how well they are built either by the impacts of weathering the impacts of repetitive heavy vehicle axle loads or both professional engineering pavement design also recognizes pavement will have local failures during its life because of the imperfect nature of the natural soil subgrade pavement materials and construction techniques pavements designed by pavement professionals are therefore designed with assumptions and calculations of the need for maintenance repair of isolated failures and refurbishment during the pavement life all pavement literature recognizes that the three essential components of good pavement performance are a proper pavement design for the in situ conditions b proper construction consistent with the design and c proper and timely maintenance and repair failure in the proper execution of any one of these three components will lead to very substantial increases in long term pavement cost andor inadequate pavement serviceability these three components are discussed further below a pavement design the following is a discussion of certain important elements of the engineering approach taken to establish the pavement design materials and construction methods specified for subdivision streets in  pavement design method and required thicknesses 7 asphalt concrete asphalt paving mixture and construction specifications and geotechnical exploration and earthwork construction requirements 1 proper pavement engineering design requires economic analysis of pavement design alternatives for an indepth discussion of the engineering economics of pavements see of the aashto 93 pavement design manual the economic engineering design objective used herein is to minimize pavement 50 year net present value life cycle costs to the pavement customer while maintaining adequate pavement serviceability the pavement customer is defined as the amalgamation of the subdivision lothome purchaser occupant tax payer and citizen there is no attempt to differentiate any of these customer subgroups collectively they are the pavement customer the customer pays all of the costs of pavement home purchase price rent and various forms of taxes kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design pavement cost over the pavement life cycle includes construction costs  maintenance repair and refurbishment costs  and costs related to the time value of money thus net present value these various costs include any overhead and profit that is related to the goods and services provided a 50 year life cycle was chosen for the analysis period because there is substantial local experience that demonstrates subdivision pavements when properly designed built maintained and resurfaced can last 50 years or more a longer analysis period was not chosen because transportation modes and pavement loading maintenance and repair methods and materials and all sorts of other related factors are simply not foreseeable beyond 50 years pavement designs herein are also designed with a 20 year design life or performance period defined as the time that an initial pavement will last before it needs rehabilitation pavement designs presented herein are designed to last at least 50 years as long as properly constructed maintained and resurfaced over the 50 year period as shown in c pavement maintenance herein figure a1aa detail #25 also shows a method of extending the pavement life past 50 years using existing refurbishment and resurfacing methods any alternate pavement design submitted for a particular subdivision by a pavement design professional must also include a 20 year design life and a 50 year life cycle maintenance repair and resurfacing analysis including relevant traffic loading 2 the pavement subgrade is the soil directly under the pavement pavements rely on the subgrade for structural support subgrades must therefore be constructed of soils with adequate load bearing capacity properly prepared portland cement concrete concrete is a rigid pavement and spreads traffic loads over a larger subgrade area as compared to asphalt cement concrete asphalt pavement which is a flexible pavement because of this wheel load distribution difference in the nature of these two pavement types asphalt pavements require a higher minimum subgrade bearing capacity than concrete pavements pavement specifications herein require subgrade soils that when properly prepared will produce a bearing capacity or california bearing ratio cbr of 2 or greater for concrete pavement and cbr of 3 or greater for asphalt pavement a substantial majority not all of potential future subdivision sites in kenton county have natural soils that when properly prepared will produce an adequate subgrade bearing capacity to support concrete or asphalt but not necessarily both for subdivision locations with in situ soils that will not produce these minimum bearing capacities for the pavement type that the developer selects properly designed and built subgrade improvements will be required quality control of asbuilt subgrades is a very important component of assuring the expected pavement design performance 3 the repetition of equivalent 18000 pound single axle loads esals going over the pavement during its life is one mode of eventual pavement failure therefore estimates of esals are required to properly design pavements pavement designs herein include esal loading estimates during land development construction building construction and traffic activity after full building occupancy the estimate methods and quantities are shown in kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design figure c1a exhibit a any alternate pavement designs must be based on these esal estimates or greater 4 pavement surface and subsurface storm water conditions are another important consideration in pavement design the primary engineering design methods for minimizing the negative effects of storm water on pavement and pavement subgrades are 1 preventing water from entering the pavement 2 providing drainage that quickly removes excess water that enters the pavement and 3 building the pavement strong enough to resist the combined effects of wheel load and water because asphalt is more porous and has higher reliance on subgrade strength as compared to concrete pavement accounting for the potential negative effects of water entering asphalt pavements and pavement subgrade is more critical for asphalt pavements the design features specified in these regulations use all three methods listed above to minimize the negative effects of storm water on subdivision pavement the primary pavement requirements used in these regulations for effective storm water surface and subsurface management are as follows a rural development streets i three percent surface cross slope as shown in figure a1e detail #5 and figure a1f detail #6 ii subgrade cross slope of three percent for concrete streets and three percent +2 inches for asphalt streets as shown in figure a1c detail #3 figure a1d detail #4 figure a1e detail #5 and figure a1f detail #6 iii drainage ditches on both sides of the street where the ditch depth is always deeper than the subgrade at the outside edge of pavement as shown in figure a1e detail #5 and figure a1f detail #6 b suburban and urban streets most subdivision pavements likely to be built in kenton county will be classified as urban or suburban these streets are built with curb and gutter the pavement with curb and gutter serves as a surface storm water conduit which is designed to collect surface storm water off the street and off adjoining subdivision lots and transport that storm water to street catch basins which connect to storm sewers street design requirements herein are designed to get and keep storm water in the gutter flow line of these streets as much as practical i all streets a curb and gutter and three percent surface cross grade to get and keep storm water in the gutter line until it is collected at catch basins see figure a1c detail #3 and figure a1d detail #4 b build public sidewalk so that the edge nearest the street is built six inches above the adjacent curb on sloped curbs and three inches above the curb on barrier curbs this maintains positive street drainage even after multiple pavement overlays see figure a1c detail #3 and figure a1d detail #4 c install continuous edge drain at the outside edge of the pavement on both sides of the street as shown in figure a1c detail #3 figure a1d kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design detail #4 figure a1x detail #22 and figure a1y detail #23 this edge drain will help drain the subgrade help keep surface water from the outside edge of the pavement out of the subgrade and will help drain joints in concrete and the asphaltconcrete curb and gutter interface d provide for subgrade drainage and edge drain drainage at all paired catch basins as shown on the required street cross at catch basin crossings in figure a1b detail #2 ii concrete streets a all pavement joints are properly sealed with joint sealing compound to minimize water penetrating those joints and getting into the subgrade b all pavements are built with a three percent subgrade cross grade see figure a1c detail #3 and figure a1e detail #5 continuous from centerline to edge of curb which will help any water that gets into the subgrade to the outside of the curb and to the edge drain iii asphalt streets a the surface course of asphalt has been designed to minimize the water that will penetrate the pavement and get into the subgrade b the finish course of asphalt is built  inch above the curb apron to force any surface water toward the gutter line rather than allow the water to lay out in the pavement surface for extended periods of time c the curb apron is built with a six percent cross pitch to keep water in the gutter line d the asphalt joint at the concrete curb apron is sealed with joint sealer to keep water from penetrating joint into the subgrade e the subgrade is built with a three percent plus two inch cross slope and is built continuously from the centerline to the outside of the curb to help drain the subgrade and help minimize the potential for water penetrating into the subgrade from the outside edge of the pavement f the first course of pavement base asphalt or kytc crushed stone base is continuous from the centerline to the outside edge of the pavement and the concrete curb and gutter is built on top of the first course of base which will help keep water from penetrating the subgrade at the outside edge of the pavement and will help support the curb and reduce potential for curb breakage in regards to building the pavement strong enough to resist the combined effects of wind and water the subgrade design parameters used in table 441 account for substantial kenton county seasonal variability in subgrade support consistent with substantial change in water content of subgrade soils seasontoseason 5 there are many other design material and construction method details set out in  pavement design method and required thicknesses 7 asphalt concrete asphalt paving mixture and construction specifications geotechnical exploration and earthwork construction requirements and appendix a standard kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design construction drawings that are important to good pavement performance because these details are not discussed here does not diminish their importance b pavement construction quality control construction quality control which means building the pavement with good construction practices and in substantial conformance with these subdivision regulations and the approved construction design drawings is the responsibility of the subdivision developer and its agents who are the engineers and construction contractors hired by that developer to design and build that subdivisions improvements the planning commissions role in construction quality control is staff or other quality control service provider to confirm and document that the subdivision design drawings satisfy these regulations and that the inplace subdivision improvements are built in substantial accordance to these subdivision regulations and the subdivision design drawings c pavement maintenance the need for and benefit of timely and adequate maintenance by the street pavements owners is documented throughout the pavement literature failure to properly and timely maintain pavements will lead to substantially increased customer pavement costs andor diminished pavement serviceability 1 recommended 50 year life cycle maintenance the following is a schedule for maintenance repair and resurfacing that can be expected in an effort to minimize customer 50 year life cycle costs for subdivision pavements a recommended asphalt pavement owner maintenance minor maintenance  joint and crack seal every three years  spot curb repair  spot pavement repair major maintenance  at approximately +17 years  spot

pavement lengthening below  localized failure repairs major maintenance  at approximately +17 years  spot curb repair  spot slab repair  at approximately +34 years  spot curb repair  spot slab and

line  install asphalt skim coat and stress absorbing asphalt membrane interlayer sami over the width of the pavement  install 1inch deep asphalt surface overlay with a four percent gutter line to centerline cross slope c management of concrete pavement lengthening concrete pavements can expand in length later in the pavements life as described on appendix c engineers committee final report  problem #12b while the pavement design features incorporated into this regulation along with proper owner pavement maintenance will minimize this lengthening the potential for lengthening and the related potential negative impacts cannot be eliminated the design feature incorporated into these regulations which will allow for the identification and management of any potential negative impacts to improvements on private property is the placement of a total of three inches of expansion joint material within the street rightofway at each driveway apron as shown in figure a1t detail #18 figure a1u detail #19 and figure a1v detail #20 the pavement owners regular inspection every three years of the expansion material to see if the three inches of expansion material has closed up to two inches or less is required if the expansion material has closed up to two inches or less remedial action consisting of saw cutting the driveway apron next to the curb to allow for additional expansion is required the preceding is one set of proven longterm pavement management strategies that have been used on northern kentucky subdivision streets there are others that have been effective when these strategies are properly and timely executed on pavement designs in these regulations properly constructed the result should be satisfactory pavement performance for at least 50 years without pavement replacement kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design as new more cost effective maintenance and repair strategies are developed over time they should be adopted for use 2 extending pavement life beyond 50 years figure a1aa detail #25 shows a methodology of extending pavement life that should allow most subdivision pavements properly built and maintained under these regulations to have their life extended beyond 50 years without replacement obviously many things can and likely will change over the next 50 years that will substantially change the best course of action for refurbishment or replacement of these subdivision pavements kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  purpose green

conveyance establishing a strategy to determine what portions of stormwater are to be filtered into the ground on site and what portions of stormwater are to flowthrough the site for management elsewhere  d provides benefits to the environment as well as to the development community by improving water quality and restoring aquatic habitats while controlling flooding this approach can increase rainfall infiltration and groundwater recharge with potentially large environmental benefits and potentially lower net costs  both to the environment and to the developer the integrated stormwater management techniques provide innovative options for developers to rethink overall site design and layout to utilize a site more efficiently while providing better stormwater management opportunities than traditional gray infrastructure  e uses multiple impervious area reduction techniques within the context of an overall site design to reduce the negative runoff impact created with the development or redevelopment of a site and ideally reduce the amount of underground pipe infrastructure necessary on a site  kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  site layout strategies f promotes the aesthetic value of integrated stormwater management in addition to the benefits of maintaining healthy waterways and the multiple environmental benefits supporting healthy communities found in the use of integrated stormwater management the use of these techniques can provide aesthetic value to a community with the use of added vegetation to the landscape by integrating natural processes into the built environment these techniques provide stormwater management flood mitigation and control and air quality management with more aesthetic appeal than standard gray stormwater infrastructure  site layout strategies 521 overall site layout strategies are encouraged to be incorporated into an integrated stormwater management plan site layout strategies are the first step in managing stormwater in a way that mimics natural hydrology using land more efficiently for development preserving critical ecological areas and reducing runoff site design are vital to maintaining a healthy watershed stormwater management works most effectively in conjunction with an overall site design strategy which identifies how the stormwater impacts created by the development will be addressed 522 a site design strategy should include identification of which portions of expected stormwater will be managed using either infiltration methods retention methods or flowshifting the focus toward the utilization of rainwater as a resource that should be managed as close to where it falls as possible and away from addressing rainwater solely as a waste that should be removed from a site will increase the efficiency of stormwater management 523 effective stormwater management will utilize multiple methods aimed at managing runoff infiltration into natural systems as well as use of management methods which remove water from the site infrastructure without adding significant impacts to local waterways and watersheds the elements work collectively to lessen the negative impacts to nearby waterways and watershed systems 524 efficiently designing a site should include conscious efforts to minimize the impervious areas created by new streets pedestrian pathways parking or buildings  elements of integrated stormwater management 531 the following elements are examples of integrated stormwater management which when used in coordination with effective site design strategies can aid in lowering the negative impact to local waterways and watersheds once a strategy has been established to minimize collection and conveyance these elements can be utilized in varying combinations to successfully implement stormwater to be filtered into the ground on site and stormwater to flowsite for management elsewhere kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management a narrower rightofway widths whether used in conjunction with narrower pavement widths or traditional width pavements narrowing the rightofway established within a site is a significant opportunity to reduce the quantity and increase the quality of storm water runoff by allowing structures to be set closer to the street because of the topography that is typical for this region many developments involve land that includes ridge tops hillside slopes and headwater streams as such development plans often include streets and structures constructed along ridge tops with back yards that extend down the hillside slopes and into headwater streams placing structures closer to the ridge top lessens the need for earthwork and tree removal along these hillside slopes which keeps more undisturbed land on the slopes and near the headwater streams in addition to the added benefit of helping to ensure hillside stability lessening hillside disturbance and tree removal will result in a lesser impact to the natural flow regime and therefore a lesser impact to water quantity and water quality in these headwater streams as well as the corresponding receiving streams downstream of the site see figure 53a figure 53a illustration of narrower rightofway widths kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management b grassy swales bioretention swales without curb and gutter and grassy swales with curb and gutter containing cutouts and flumes swales are long and narrow depressions in the landscape which incorporate vegetation to gradually move stormwater site by use of gentle slopes to guide runoff system swales are primarily used to slow the speed of stormwater runoff as it moves site though some infiltration can occur when slopes less than five percent and soils are favorable the vegetation used within swales typically requires lower ongoing maintenance than that of traditional landscaping when used in combination with curb and gutter containing cutouts and flumes the swales provide the same benefit as traditional swales without curb and gutter by collecting stormwater outside of traditional gray infrastructure associated with the site and decreasing the impacts of development to the overall manmade stormwater management system however this system offers the added benefit of providing curb and gutter along the edge of streets to help buttress asphalt pavements create a welldefined pavement edge and increase the overall pavement edge lifespan see figure 53b and figure 53c figure 53b illustration of a grassy swale without curb and gutter kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management figure 53c illustration of a grassy swale with curb and gutter c infiltration gardens biofiltration swales or rain gardens infiltration gardens are shallow depressions in the landscape which provide larger often unused or leftover areas on a site to filter stormwater into the natural soils and groundwater system use of infiltration gardens can significantly lessen the amount of stormwater collected into piping infrastructure the vegetation used within infiltration gardens typically requires lower ongoing maintenance than that of traditional landscaping see figure 53d kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management figure 53d illustration of an infiltration garden d pedestrian walkways as a design element alternative pedestrian ways which are outside of the requirements set forth in table 411 can be created to constitute a pedestrian circulation system equal to the level of effectiveness that traditional sidewalk on one or both sides of the street would provide rather than including sidewalks only within the rightofway along the street integrating a well thought out pedestrian circulation system throughout a site can reduce impervious surface while potentially lowering the construction cost and raising the stormwater management benefits of the overall site incorporating a strategic system of pedestrian walkways linking key destinations within a site in conjunction with aligning connections for travel outside the site will increase usability of walkway networks additionally incorporating materials such as mulch gravel or other pervious material can further reduce the hard surface runoff when adding sidewalks to one or both sides of every street often important pedestrian connections are not made the sidewalks themselves are under ifatall utilized and excessive impervious surfaces are created kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management figure 53e illustration of pedestrian walkways as a design element e planter boxes planters are long narrow often rectangular landscaped areas with vertical walls and flat unsloped bottoms and are able to store a greater volume of water than swales because they are typically deeper and provide more capacity water flows into the planter absorbs into the topsoil and plants fills to a predetermined overflow elevation and discharges into the overflow system provided two types of planters are used for stormwater management 1 flowflowhave a sealed bottom and sides and absorb only as much water as the soil and plants in the planter can accommodate they allow water to slowly travel soil profile prior to overflowing into a subsurface underdrain system see figure 53f kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management figure 53f

management f permeable pavement if underlying soils allow for the natural infiltration of rain water constructing pavement using permeable materials can allow for stormwater to filter pavement and into the natural ground water system while still providing the structural integrity necessary for the sites automobile and pedestrian traffic the use of permeable pavement can mitigate the overall impact of the development to the piping infrastructure systems while maintaining full functionality of the developed site see figure 53h figure 53i and figure 53j figure 53h illustration of permeable

rainwater trees naturally work to physically slow the flow of water site by intercepting stormwater on their leaf surfaces as well as root structure not only do trees collect water for their growth their physical presence on the landscape intercepts the flow of water downhill and slows its movement see figure 53k figure 53k illustration of preserving existing trees and planting new trees kenton

report to the kenton county planning commission from the kenton county street standards engineers committee ssec members mark brueggemann pe  joe kramer pe  jim viox pe  ted vogelpohl pe  henry fischer chairman background in 2008 the kenton county planning commission kcpc initiated an effort to update the kenton county subdivision regulations as a part of the update process input was solicited from various interested groups in kenton county among those responding the kenton county mayors group the kenton county judge executive the land development council of the home builders association of northern kentucky hbanky and the northern kentucky society of professional engineers nkspe were particularly active in their response by mid2013 there was consensus agreement among the interested groups and the kcpc staff on most parts of the updated draft regulations the area where there remained substantial disagreement among the parties mentioned above was that part of the regulation draft that dealt with requirements for future subdivision street pavements during the late stages of this community discussion at the suggestion of the kenton county judge executive and several city mayors and authorization of the planning commission chairman a committee of five local pavement professionals with over 150 years of collective experience in the design construction reconstruction and maintenance of subdivision pavements was formed and took on the name of kenton county street standards engineers committee ssec the committee members are listed above this committee was asked as a voluntary community service to do the following analyze existing subdivision pavement performance evaluate that performance compared to reasonable expectations for pavement performance and make recommendations that would improve pavement customer value in future subdivision pavements all earlier community discussion on pavement performance was to be considered as input into their process the committee established a problem analysis and decision making approach with the objective of providing kenton county subdivision pavement customers home purchaserowner home occupant taxpayer citizen maximized longterm pavement value over the course of a year the committee met for two hour meetings normally twice weekly to generate their analysis and recommendations in addition there were meetings and conversations with many other individuals and groups seeking their advice input and consensus agreement those groups included  the kenton county planning commission subdivision regulations committee  kenton county planning commission  kenton county mayors group subdivision regulation review committee  various northern kentucky city and county engineers  various northern kentucky city and county public works officials  brian wood pe  executive director of plantmix asphalt industry of kentucky  local concrete and asphalt producers  local subdivision improvement contractors  the northern kentucky society of professional engineers continuing education session feb 24 2014 kenton county subdivision regulations   appendix c engineers committee final report recommendations for improvement in the kenton county subdivision regulation street standards the following represents the consensus problem identification and recommendations for improvement in kenton county subdivision street regulations by the ssec besides many hours of analysis and discussion by our committee input into the analysis and decision making process was solicited received and considered from a broad spectrum of those involved in the design construction and maintenance of subdivision streets especially those who have been involved in the kcpc subdivision regulation update process in addition many sources from the professional pavement design and maintenance literature were considered and used it is noteworthy that the recommendations contained in this report are the unanimous recommendations of the members of the ssec the ssec hereby respectfully requests that the kcpc accept the following analysis and incorporate these recommendations into the revised subdivision regulation street standards now under their consideration problem identification realistic problem solving requires accurate definition of the problems and their root causes that is the aim of the following as it relates to problems in existing kenton county subdivision pavements and improvements for the design and regulation of future pavements the following is a list of the most critical problems and opportunities for improvement that have been identified in kenton county subdivision pavements installed from roughly 1985 28 years old to 2000 13 years old the significance of 1985 is that in 198 there was a substantial effort by the northern kentucky engineering homebuilding and local government community to improve new subdivision pavement performance this 1985 effort resulted in a substantial upgrade and standardization of subdivision pavement regulations across northern kentucky including kenton county the subdivision pavements built from 1985 to 2000 in kenton county were built under those 1985 regulations there was little to no change in the pavement regulations during that period jim viox henry fischer and thelen associates inc george thelen then and ted vogelpohl now have been participants in both the 1985 update effort and this current update effort this continuity has benefitted this current effort greatly it is also noteworthy that very significant improvements in pavement performance and citizen homeowner taxpayer pavement value resulted from that 1985 effort hopefully as much or more value can be gained from this current effort problems common to asphalt and concrete pavement 1 pavement performance standards are not clear in the current regulations pavement design parameters performance expectations and procedures for and the importance of proper pavement maintenance are not set out this has often resulted in unclear and unrealistic expectations for pavement performance and maintenance within the kenton county community 2 quality assurance efforts in pavement construction in some cases have been lacking leading to premature pavement failure related to this problem is the fact that some construction and material specifications in the current subdivision regulations are inadequate to insure quality pavement performance in other instances the existing regulations dont provide an adequate description of material and construction specification tolerances that can be achieved using good material control and construction practices this lack of proper tolerances leads to ambiguity confusion and arbitrary decision making during construction on what the acceptable material and construction standards are various aspects of this quality assurance kenton county subdivision regulations   appendix c engineers committee final report effort are the responsibility of the developers the design and geotechnical engineers the construction contractor and the kcpc and its designated inspection agency 3 in many cases subdivision streets in kenton county communities have not been adequately maintained by their owners thus shortening pavement life and substantially increasing ultimate customer longterm pavement costs 4 there is no consideration given in existing regulations pavement design of how to extend pavement life beyond the 20 year design life 5 subgrade strength is in some cases being degraded because of water penetrating into and weakening the subgrade there is a need for improvement in the drainage characteristics of subdivision pavements both surface and subsurface  there are design shortfalls as well as construction quality control and maintenance shortfalls this problem is much more critical in asphalt pavements because of asphalts high reliance on subgrade strength as compared to concretes reliance on uniform subgrade support 6 pavement failures caused by utility ditch settlement under the street this is a more costly per occurrence but less frequent problem for concrete pavements 7 existing subdivision regulation standards for streets in industrial and commercial subdivisions are often inadequate for the heavy truck traffic loading these streets must support problems specific to asphalt street pavements 8 when asphalt pavements came into common use in kenton county in the early 1990s there was a failure to recognize and address the fact that asphalt pavements are more dependent on subgrade strength than concrete pavements often there was an assumption that subgrade strength that was good enough for concrete was good enough for asphalt this isnt true this assumption led to some asphalt pavement failures caused by inadequate subgrade preparation andor inadequate subgrade materials 9 asphalt pavement subgrade weakening caused by inadequate pavement surface and subsurface storm water management root causes include inadequate subgrade and surface cross slope both in design and inadequate quality control  water penetrating the asphaltcurb apron interface due to the asphalt being finished below the curb apron  inadequate curb apron cross slope to the gutter line  the asphalt subgrade being cut lower than the adjacent curb subgrade thus trapping water under the asphalt  water penetrating the subgrade from the area outside the curb  and inadequate sealing and maintenance of the asphaltcurb apron interface another problem in this area relates to the improper use of more brittle asphalt materials designed specifically for highway use when more brittle asphalt materials are used in subdivision pavements premature surface cracks develop in the body of the pavement allowing water to penetrate pavement into the subgrade and accelerating deterioration of the pavement subgrade 10 there are inadequate quality assurance requirements in the current regulations for asphalt material and no asphalt inplace density requirements or testing 11 in some limited cases there have been excessive premature asphalt street concrete curb and gutter failures some causes include improper or inadequate isolation joints at structures catch basins  inadequate curb cross section bending strength andor inadequate subgrade support  and inadequate concrete material quality leading to dcracking and other freezethaw concrete deterioration kenton county subdivision regulations   appendix c engineers committee final report problems specific to concrete street pavements 12 premature pavement failures caused by inplace concrete not being resistant enough to natural multiyear freezethaw and expansioncontraction cycles causes include a concrete mixes coarse aggregate type and cement content that are not resistant enough to concrete dcracking and the use of appropriate deicers note that some inappropriate deicers will cause concrete deterioration even with appropriate concrete mixes the dcracking problem leads to deterioration at the joints as well as total concrete failure in the body of the concrete slabs b excessive concrete street lengthening or growth problems that are caused by the use of expansion joints in the pavement expansive gravel 57s coarse aggregate premature load transfer failures at contraction joints joint seal failure and poor maintenance another pavement condition that can contribute to the problem is where pavement lengthening is relatively unrestricted such as at the end of downhill culdesacs measures to manage potential pavement growth impacts on private property outside of the pavement can also be improved 13 premature contraction joint load transfer failure which causes rough vehicle ride and eventual slab failure this problem is caused by the separation of the contraction joints due to the use of expansion joints and more recently since 1990 by the use of substantial amounts of #8 gravel in pavement concrete mixes the addition of #8 gravel and corresponding reduction in 57s gravel decreases the percentage of total aggregate above  in size and thus decreases the aggregate interlock across the contraction joint inadequate joint seal maintenance is another contributing factor to this problem this type failure also contributes significantly to concrete problems described in number 12 above recommendation objective the most serious and improvable existing subdivision pavement problems have been identified along with their root causes the objective now is to find solutions to those problems that yield the pavement customer house purchaser home owner occupant taxpayer citizen the lowest possible 50 year net present value for the pavement life cycle costs net present value accounts for the time value of money which is the basis for evaluating any pavement option initial construction costs pavement joint maintenance localized failure repair and resurfacing costs are the primary life cycle costs 50 years was selected as the reasonable period to evaluate pavement use performance and maintenance it is anticipated that the life of most subdivision pavements as designed here can be extended beyond 50 years when properly constructed and maintained with additional refurbishment and repair some time after 50 years the following committee recommendations are consistent with this preceding objective note that local suburban subdivision streets which represent the bulk of subdivision streets built in kenton county are used as examples in many of these recommendations and exhibits these recommendations are easily adapted to other classes of subdivision streets recommendations 1 for all engineering material and construction

delete from that list the following steps will be taken a at the preliminary subdivision plan stage the geotechnical engineer will use his local soils knowledge usgs soils mapping and a visual field reconnaissance to report on the likelihood of soils on that specific site meeting the minimum cbr values for subgrade the report will also include observations relative to the sites suitability for building support b at construction drawing submittal the geotechnical engineer will submit a report on the soil types the expected cbr of those soil types that exist on that section of lots being submitted or possibly on the subdivision as a whole this submittal will also include information on other issues of structural subsurface stability for proposed subdivision public land improvements planned for the site these judgments will be based on the results of soil borings open trench exploration soil testing etc that are sufficient for the geotechnical engineer to render his engineering opinion c during mass earthwork subgrade materials will be evaluated as to their meeting required densities and as to the subgrade materials being used being capable of producing the cbr required to meet the base subdivision street design when compacted to the required densities reports as to these results will be submitted by the geotechnical engineer to the kcpc prior to the installation of pavement if subgrade soils are substandard remedial subgradepavement enhancement will be designed and submitted to kcpc d prior to pavement being installed the subgrade will be tested for density

served for a particular street is defined as the number of lots which that street serves as the sole access or where a number of served by more than one access it is an approximation of the number of lots served that is equivalent to one access  example 1 a particular section street serves as the sole access to less than 200 street would then be a local street  example 2 an area of existing and future residential development of 450 served by more than one access street only those streets that will carry traffic and esal loading higher than a subdivision street that provides sole access to more than 200 be classified as a subcollector street 6 geogrid shall be tensar tx5 triaxial geogrid 7 parking one side 8 no onstreet parking 9 all residential collector streets serving above 1000 lots

issues to consider in the selection of aggregate type and distribution in concrete mixes in unreinforced concrete pavement with nondoweled contraction joints all kenton county sub reg pavements except commercialindustrial having a relatively high percentage of large angular aggregate supports good longterm contraction joint performance the comparative measure of aggregate size distribution used for
