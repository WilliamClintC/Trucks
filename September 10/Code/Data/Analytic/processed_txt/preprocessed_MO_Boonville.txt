governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the city council of the city ordains as follows  41811 findings of fact a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for cooper county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood  41811 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in section 752a  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d by applying the provisions of this chapter to 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and 3 protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard  41811 secs 7547520  reserved article ii  general provisions lands to which chapter

with plants and landscape materials  3 to preserve and incorporate naturally occurring open space and forested areas in development plans to manage stormwater runoff  4 to establish standards to protect and enhance community appearance with the installation of appropriate landscaping and screening materials within the city  5 to encourage prudent and skilled workmanship for the installation and maintenance of all plant materials  6 to provide flexibility in the provision of required landscape materials and designs  and 7 to improve air quality to reduce heat and glare and to add to the aesthetic quality of parking lots trees appreciably reduce the dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air are proven producers of oxygen and play a vital role otherwise in purifying the air we breathe trees are valuable physical and aesthetic community assets in that they provide cooling shade reduce noise levels and glare and break the monotony of large parking areas and other human developments a variety of species of trees and shrubs is encouraged to reduce the impact of potential disease or insect infestations and to provide variety in shape texture and seasonal color exh a

this reference motor vehicles and traffic ch 12 appendix e  storm drainage and stormwater management design manual footnotes  1  editors note exh a adopted  amended app e in its entirety to read as herein set out former app e  118 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  11402   1708 foreword this manual has been prepared to present the criteria to be used in the city for the design of facilities to control storm runoff it is intended that this design manual will be applied to areas of new development and also provide guidance for the construction and reconstruction of storm drains in areas previously developed the standards in the design manual are to be followed at all times unless the developer or his engineer can show significant financial savings in providing alternative facilities which still fulfill the intended requirements and intents of the design manual the circumstances and reason for any change and the proposed alternative shall be set forth in writing for consideration by the city engineer it is realized that standards and specifications must be flexible and adaptable to new design procedures materials equipment and methods of construction in order to provide the best facilities for health and safety in the most economical manner thus it is intended that the design manual be updated periodically users should check to ensure that they have the most recent edition it is important that users should also consult the most recent city ordinances and regulations that might include references to storm drainage exh a 61608 hydrology runoff rate computation storm drainage facilities for residential subdivisions and small commercial or industrial developments with watersheds less than 200 acres shall be designed on the basis of discharges calculated by the rational formula in calculations for stormwater detention or retention basins the following computer implementations of the unit hydrograph are acceptable a scs technical release no 55 urban hydrology for small watersheds 2 nd edition june 1986 b scs technical release no 20 project formulation hydrology 2 nd edition may 1983 rational formula the rational formula is expressed as q   cia where q   peak runoff rate in cubic feet per second cfs c   runoff coefficient which expresses the ratio of peak runoff to rainfall and which is dependent upon the pervious characteristics of the surface receiving the rainfall i   rainfall intensity in inches per hour for a duration equal to the time of concentration a   tributary area in acres drainage area the area a is the only parameter in the rational formula which is subject to accurate determination and represents the total area tributary to any point under consideration for which runoff is being determined since runoff is subject to various characteristics of the area investigation of the drainage area should include a compilation of principal factors which may affect runoff these factors include land use areas of impervious and pervious surfaces character of soil and vegetation cover and the general magnitude of ground slopes a current topographic map with contours should be obtained for use in drainage area calculations all upstream tributary areas are to be considered as fully developed as zoned at the time of design or as shown in the citys comprehensive plan whichever is greater the city may require that storm drainage systems for tributary areas upstream of existing storm drainage facilities include onsite stormwater detention facilities limiting the peak discharge to that which would have occurred for the existing land use type prior to a zoning change or prior to changes in development of the area the city may waive requirements for detention facilities when the owner andor the developer make satisfactory arrangements to improve or provide a downstream drainage system of adequate hydraulic capacity for peak rates of discharge to the system including discharge from the owners site to a point downstream where the rate of total runoff from the site is ten percent or less of the total runoff rate conveyed by the downstream system measured at the time of system peak rate the city may at its option also permit downstream system improvements and detention combinations that provide the same level of control runoff coefficients of the parameters in the rational formula runoff coefficients are the least subject to accurate determination surface runoff is affected by vegetation and evapotranspiration the most significant factor is percolation into the soil which is greatly influenced by soil type and surface vegetation it is common practice to use general overall runoff coefficients which are based upon either land uses or surface characteristics runoff coefficients from table 1 and calculation form b are to be used for runoff calculations time of concentration t c  time of concentration is the period of time required for runoff to become established and for water to flow from the most distant point of the drainage area to the point under consideration time of concentration consists of an overland flow component and a channel flow component a minimum time of concentration of five minutes shall be used for runoff from pavements and paved swales a minimum of ten minutes shall be used at inlets intercepting runoff from grassed swales time of concentration overland flow the selection or computation of the overland flow component of the time of concentration t c and the determination of the variables which affect it is a very critical and important step in computing the peak rate of runoff for a particular drainage area the length slope and composite runoff coefficient must be determined the length is the distance from the extremity or most remote point in the catchment area in the direction parallel to the slope until a defined channel or inlet is reached to the first inlet gutter flow will be considered as channel flow and handled as such the total time of concentration will be the time of overland flow plus the time within the channel the slope in percent is the difference in elevation between the most remote point in the catchment area and the downstream edge of the overland flow area divided by the horizontal distance between the two points a composite runoff coefficient will be determined for the tributary area where overland flow will occur a nomograph figure 1 is included for estimating overland flow time time of concentration channel flow the time of concentration within the channel can be determined by solving the manning formula for discharge q   149n ar <xpp frax2 3> s 12 and the continuity equation q   av in which q   the quantity of water flowing in the channel cfs a   the crosssectional area of water at a given channel section sq feet  v   the mean velocity of water given channel section fps r   the hydraulic radius which is the crosssectional area a divided by the wetted perimeter of the section w feet  s   the slope of the energy grade line which is equal to the water surface and the channel bottom in uniform flow feet feet  n   the roughness coefficient from table 2 figure 6 can be used in the general solution of the mannings formula since the quantity of stormwater reaching an open channel will normally increase continuously along its length and the velocity will vary from the upper to the lower end of a channel section it will be necessary to determine the average velocity in the channel section in order to compute a value for t c  typical channel cross sections near the upper and lower ends of the channel section can be plotted and the average slope determined from field survey information or from a contour map of the area a value of n can be selected from table 2 the quantity of water at the upper end of the channel can be computed various water depths on the typical section can be tried and corresponding values for a and r determined until the q computed by the manning formula is equivalent to the design q the values of a and q can then be substituted into the continuity equation to determine the velocity v at the section being considered by using the same steps a velocity can be computed at the lower end of the channel section and an average velocity determined velocities for channelized gutter flow can be taken from figures 2 3 and 4 time of concentration within the channel is then equal to the length of the channel section l in feet divided by the average velocity v a  in feet per minute t c   lv a the time of concentration within the channel must be estimated so approximate q and v values typical cross section at the lower end of the channel can be computed and used in determining the actual time of concentration in the channel this principle can also be applied if a closed conduit is involved instead of an open channel except that the quantity of water and velocity will normally not vary from the upper to the lower end of the conduit length under consideration therefore only one value of velocity will need to be determined in the case of a pipe it will be sufficient to use the velocity when the pipe is flowing full to find the t c  figures 5 and 6 can be used in computing velocity of flow in closed conduits frequency interval the frequency or return period is the statistical average interval between rainfalls having an equal magnitude storm drain facilities in residential areas shall be designed as a minimum for a 10year frequency storm in the central business district and connected business areas industrial areas and new business and industrial areas drains shall be designed for a 25year frequency storm storm drain facilities in new residential areas located below an existing or projected business or industrial area in drainage basins shall be designed to handle the 25year frequency storm drainage business or industrial area although storm drain systems are to be designed for storm frequencies as discussed above new systems for undeveloped areas as stipulated by the city shall include provisions for handling the design runoff without threat to personal safety or undue property damage in accordance with the design storm return relationships shown in table 3 provisions for handling the runoff in excess of the minimum design storm may include but not be limited to temporary detention facilities gutter flows to curb depth drainage easements for overland flow or simply limiting development to elevations above the flood plain if provisions cannot be made otherwise to handle the excess runoff the storm drain system shall be designed for the total runoff with the approval of the city rainfall intensity selection of a rainfall intensity is made from rainfall intensitydurationfrequency data prepared from historical rainfall data for the area which is provided in table 4 the storm return frequency to be used is dependent upon the land use category which is being protected and is selected from table 3 the storm duration is equal to the total time of concentration at the point under consideration flows two separate design flows must be developed for most storm drainage projects first design flows for gutter capacity and inlet location and capacity are developed for these calculations time of concentration is equal to time of overland flow for the incremental drainage area under consideration plus travel time for gutter flow the design discharge rate is equal to that discharge calculated by the rational formula plus any flow bypassed around upstream inlets resulting design flows are used to locate and size inlets and connecting laterals to storm drains second design flows for storm drain capacity are developed for these calculations time of concentration is equal to the cumulative time of concentration from the uppermost reaches of the drainage area to the point under consideration the runoff coefficient is a composite or weighted average coefficient for the entire area upstream of the point under consideration design flow is equal to the discharge calculated by the rational formula using the above cumulative values for time of concentration and the composite runoff coefficient exh a 61608 storm drain design recommended criteria and procedures for design of the major components of the storm drainage system are presented in the following sections these criteria and procedures are applicable to the most common types of drainage problems which are expected to be encountered in the city preliminary design careful planning of storm drainage systems in the preliminary design phase offers the greatest potential for cost savings and for compliance with storm drainage objectives the best time to prepare conceptual layouts of storm drainage systems is prior to finalization of street layout easement location and site grading options available to the drainage engineer are greatly reduced once the surface characteristics of the drainage basin have been set in storm drainage system design a significant part of the construction cost is represented by small diameter storm drains the longer that overland flow can be kept from reaching the street network the further the distance from the ridge line that the storm drain system need begin and the fewer the number of inlets that will be required various layout concepts should be developed and analyzed prior to selection of a final concept for detailed design once the street layouts easement locations and site grading are finalized the preliminary storm drainage system layout should be prepared whenever it is practicable storm drains should be aligned to  avoid meandering offsetting and unnecessary angular changes  angular changes in alignment should be limited to a maximum of 90 degrees  be parallel with the center line of straight streets unless otherwise unavoidable  be in a straight line between structures such as manholes inlets and junction chambers for all pipelines 30 inches in diameter and smaller  make angular changes in alignment by a uniform curve between two tangents for pipelines 33 inches in diameter and larger or by the use of hydraulically efficient junctions approved by the city preliminary selection of storm drain conduits should be based upon providing a velocity when flowing full of between three and 15 feet per second the minimum acceptable conduit diameter is 12 inches except for storm drains located beneath roadways which shall be at least 15 inches in diameter conduit capacity shall be determined by the manning equation using the appropriate n values listed in table 2 gutter and street capacities the depth of flow in gutters during the minimum design storm shall be limited to that depth that will produce a 100 spread of flow onto the pavement of a new residential street having a two percent straight crown gutter flows equal to curb depth will be allowed in residential areas for storms of greater magnitude than the minimum design frequency storm the following criteria shall be used for establishing the maximum allowable depth of gutter flow in other than residential streets and in older parabolic crowned residential streets type of street minimum width of noninundated pavement feet residential 10 collector 10 arterial 20 figures 2 and 3 show the relationship for quantity of flow q in cfs  velocity v in fps  width of water in street in feet  and street slope in percent for a street section with straight two percent crown it was derived by using mannings formula and the continuity equation stormwater inlets inlet location and design should be given careful consideration spacing and location shall be such that the depth of flow in the gutter is limited as discussed in the section on gutter and street capacities figures 7 8 and 9 are included to aid in determining inlet capacities of the various types of inlets the figures are used for sizing curbopening inlets on a continuous grade and at a low point in grade figures 7 and 8 apply only to curb or side opening inlets on continuous grades the capacity of the inlet depends upon the length of opening and the depth of flow at the opening this depth in turn depends upon the amount of depression of the flow line at the inlet and cross slope longitudinal slope and roughness of the gutter to use figures 7 and 8 the following information must be known length l of inlet opening design flow in the gutter any carryover from a previous inlet must be included longitudinal street grade in percent the procedure for using figure 7 is as follows enter figure 7 with the design flow in the gutter and the street grade at the point under consideration and determine if the design flow exceeds the capacity of the gutter at the permissible spread if the gutter capacity is exceeded additional upstream inlets are required if the design flow does not exceed the gutter capacity determine the length of inlet l required to intercept 100 percent of the gutter flow or determine the amount of bypass flow if a smaller inlet is selected bypass flow must not be allowed to enter arterial streets and must be intercepted by downstream inlets without the downstream flow exceeding the maximum for the appropriate street classifications set forth herein example design gutter flow  70 cfs street grade  4 percent from figure 7 note that on a four percent street grade a fourfoot type a inlet without deflectors will intercept 60 cfs and that 10 cfs will bypass downstream at the given street grade the eightfoot inlet will intercept 100 percent of the design flow the procedure for using figure 8 is as follows use of figure 8 is similar to that of figure 7 note that the 40 type a curb inlet with deflectors will satisfy most flows with reasonable bypassing when located to maintain the maximum tenfoot flow spread the 80 inlet would be needed approaching intersection with arterial streets or at other points where a complete interception of flow is required the nomograph on figure 9 solves inlet capacity problems under the following conditions the curbopening inlet is located at a low no grade point all flow coming to the inlet must eventually enter the inlet and will pond until sufficient head is built up so the outflow inlet will equal the peak inflow from the gutters for example enter the nomograph with any two of the three values h ql hh and read the third in which h   total height of opening in feet l   total length of opening in feet h   depth of water at the entrance in feet depth of water h shall not exceed nine inches 075 feet for type a inlets on streets with two percent straight crown q   total peak rate of flow to the inlet in cfs normally q l and h will be known and the nomograph can be used to determine the depth of water h at the inlet the spread of the water on the street will depend upon the cross slope of the pavement manholes and junction structures manholes and junction structures provide access to a drain for cleaning and act as a junction box for tributary drains therefore a manhole is required wherever a drain changes size or slope at an abrupt change in alignment where tributary drains join a main line and at intervals of not more than 500 feet if the conduit is too small for a man to enter the designer should check the head losses junction structures by using the charts provided in figure 10 since the losses can be quite significant the curves are from water supply and pollution control by clark viessman and hammer second edition they were developed for surcharged pipes entering rectangular structures but may be applied to manholes as pictures on the curves the a curve is used to find entrance and exit losses  the b curve is to evaluate the head loss due to increased velocity in the downstream direction the loss is defined as the difference between the head losses for downstream and upstream pipe v h2 v h1  in cases where the greatest velocity upstream the difference will be negative and may be applied to offset other losses in the structure the c loss results from change of direction in a manhole the d loss is related to the effect produced by the entrance of secondary flows into the structure closed conduit for storm drains storm drainpipe shall generally be reinforced concrete bituminous coated corrugated metal pipe may be used for culverts and drains under 200 feet where specifically permitted by the city pipe should be sized for the amount of water calculated to be in the pipe as determined by inlet analysis under design conditions the pipe is assumed to flow full under conditions of steady uniform flow the minimum design velocity shall be 3 feet per second pipe sizes 30 inches in diameter or less shall not decrease in the downstream direction even though increased slope may provide adequate capacity in the smaller pipe the top of opening of inflow pipes to manholes or inlets shall be at the same elevation or higher than the top of the outflow pipes pipes may be sized by using the nomograph in figure 5 or by calculation using table 5 rectangular or square concrete box structures with one or more barrels may also be used as storm drains in areas where this type of structure appears feasible comparative cost studies with prefabricated or preconstructed sections should be made to determine which is most economical the possibility of using the top slab as a driving or walking surface should also be investigated capacities for structures of this nature should be determined using the manning formula open channels open channels for storm drainage may be either natural or manmade channels closed conduits flowing less than full can be considered to be open channels wherever possible a channel should be left in its natural state normally a manmade channel lined or unlined transports water faster than a natural channel  the increased velocity reduces the time of concentration and increases the intensity of rainfall to be used in the design this in turn increases the design peak runoff for the area and could result in higher costs for structures throughout the drainage area flow in open channels should be analyzed by using the manning equation figure 6 and the continuity equation the depth at which uniform flow occurs in an open channel is the normal depth for a channel cross section with a specified discharge q uniform flow may occur at critical depth at less than critical depth or at more than critical depth depending on the channel slope flow at or near critical depth d c  is highly unstable and channel sections giving depth of flow near the critical depth should be avoided subcritical velocity will prevail at normal depths greater than the critical depth and will occur on mild slopes supercritical velocity will prevail at normal depths less than the critical depth and will occur on steep slopes critical flow is characterized by a froude number f equal to unity if f is less than 10 the flow is subcritical and if f is more than 10 the flow is supercritical the froude number f is defined as f   v vgd m in which v   velocity in feet per second g   gravitational constant 322 feet per second per

and should be investigated in areas where problems could result it is rare that uniform flow will occur in all reaches of a channel there will normally be interconnected reaches of uniform and nonuniform flow the determination of water surface profiles for a given discharge in the area of nonuniform flow may be necessary to insure against extensive property damage computations should begin at a known point and extend upstream for subcritical flow and downstream for supercritical flow standard flood profiles have been developed by the corps of engineers us army for the missouri river studies of development in the lower portions of drainage basins intersected by these streams should include the computation of backwater curves for the design storm using the 100year flood elevations at the intersections as the starting point to insure against costly errors in the design of conduits it is good practice to use the energy grade line as a basis for calculation rather than the flow line there is an abundance of reference material available concerning the various problems that can be encountered in the backwater analysis of open channels since the possible variations in conditions make each problem unique this manual does not discuss specific solutions exh a 61608 culverts at the intersection of open channels and roads streets or highways it is necessary to provide an adequately sized culvert  sizing these structures is very important to avoid bottlenecks in the drainage system design of culverts involves determination of the hydraulic performance of the structure under certain conditions in addition to its structural adequacy the more commonly used culvert types include both concrete and metal  circular pipes and arch pipes and concrete box culverts a culvert will operate with either inletcontrolled or outletcontrolled flow under inlet control the inlet geometry and the amount of headwater or ponding at the entrance are of primary importance outlet control involves the additional consideration of the elevation of the tailwater in the outlet channel and the slope roughness and length of the culvert barrel inlet control most culverts in the city will operate under inlet control culverts with inlet control are usually on steep slopes and flow partly full the headwater or depth of ponding at the entrance is an important factor in the culvert capacity the headwater depth hw is the vertical distance from the culvert invert at the entrance to the energy line of the headwater pool because of the low velocities in most entrance pools the water surface and the energy line at the entrance are assumed to be the same figures 11 were developed by the federal highway administration bureau of public roads to aid in sizing culverts enter the charts or nomographs with a trial culvert size and the design flow and read the value for hwd on the line for the appropriate entrance type hw can then be computed by multiplying the trial structure diameter or depth d by the value from the nomograph outlet control culverts with outlet control can flow with the culvert barrel full or part full for part or all of the barrel length the head h or energy required to pass a given quantity of water outletcontrolled culvert with the barrel flowing full throughout its length is made up of three major parts which include a velocity head h v   an entrance loss h e   and a friction loss h f  this energy is obtained from ponding of water at the entrance and is expressed as h   h v + h e + h f figures 15 16 and 17 which were also developed by the federal highway administration bureau of public roads are included to aid in sizing structures with outlet control and in particular to determine the value for h the headwater depth hw can be expressed by a common equation for all outlet control conditions including all depths of tailwater this is accomplished by designating the vertical dimension for the culvert invert at the outlet to the elevation from which h is measured as h o  then h   h + h o  ls o in which l   the length of the culvert in feet s o   the barrel slope in feet per foot when the water surface elevation in the outlet channel is equal to or above the elevation of the top of the culvert opening at the outlet h o is equal to the tailwater depth tw tw is the distance in feet from the outlet culvert invert to the water surface in the outlet channel if the tailwater elevation is below the top of the culvert opening at the outlet h o is more difficult to determine the discharge size and shape of culvert and the tw must be considered in these cases h o is the greater value of tw as defined above or d c + d 2 the critical depth is d c  and d is the culvert height tailwater depth is not a factor for culverts flowing below critical depth at the outlet figures 18 and 19 give critical depth d c  at various discharges for different sizes of circular and pipearch culverts to determine the value of h from the charts select the proper value of k e from table 6 and enter the chart with the quantity of flow q and the size and length of the structure values of k e different than the scales shown can be located by a straightline interpolation between the scales connect the length on the k e scale to the culvert size to establish a turning point then connect the discharge and the turning point to determine the head h the value of hw should be found for both the inlet and outlet control condition the flow condition that produces the highest value for hw governs and indicates the flow control existing under the given conditions for the trial size selected exh a 61608 erosion control slopes in the city are generally steep and erodible velocities can be expected at most enclosed drainage system outlets and in most natural or manmade channels forming elements of the urban drainage system table 7 gives maximum permissible velocities in continuously wet aged channels few watercourses in the city will fall into this category table 8 gives maximum permissible velocities in channels lined with uniform stands of grass covers well maintained most natural and manmade channels and swales in the city will fall within this category most grassed swales in the city will fall within the sod type covers in the second grouping in table 8 when outlet channel or swale velocities exceed the maximum values in the tables the city may require the use of concrete or other nonerodible linings scour aprons energy dissipators stone riprap or other protective devices exh a 61608 major system the major drainage system consists of all possible routings of runoff from storms greater than the designated design storm the major system includes the formal system hydraulically designed to convey the design runoff to receiving streams or channels the major system also includes side and rear yard swales streets and other natural or manmade avenues for large storm runoff to reach large watercourses the major system will always exist whether considered in design of the development or not safe routing of major runoff project area must be considered in the initial development of project layout and grading details of the major routings in the form of designating flowways and swales must be submitted for review concurrent with submittal of storm drainage facilities conveying the design storm estimates of the runoff rates from a 100year rainfall should be made for the various reaches of the probable major system the probable hydraulic behavior of the various flowways and swales should be examined several studies over the years have suggested that during major rainfall events runoff is significantly greater than produced by the rational formula to account for antecedent precipitation conditions producing this excess runoff the rational formula for use with major storms should be adjusted by multiplying the right side of the rational formula by a frequency factor c f  the formula now becomes q   ciac f the following table of c f should be used the product of c  c f should not exceed 10 recurrence interval years c f 50 120 100 125 exh a 61608 detention storage frequently undeveloped upper reaches of watersheds can use detention facilities to correct runoff problems or to restrict runoff from development to that which existed prior to the change in land use because of
