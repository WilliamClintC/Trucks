clogging capacity of the grate inlet will be taken as onehalf 12 on the value given by this formula d curb opening inlets the capacity of curb opening inlets will depend on whether the opening is running partially full or submerged if the depth of flow at the curb opening inlet is such as to cause a partially full opening a weir effect will develop and the following formula will apply  3 2 q   cwl h where q   the discharge of capacity in cubic feet per second cw   the weir coefficient of discharge  l   the length of curb opening in feet h   the head or depth of water at the opening in feet
