including but not limited to cleburne texas  newport news virginia  garden grove california  adams county colorado  seattle washington  phoenix arizona  indianapolis indiana  minneapolis minnesota  las vegas nevada  and cleveland ohio the city council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for some of the activities that occur on their premises 2 recent investigation by the pocatello police department has revealed that employees of some sexually oriented businesses currently in operation in the city of pocatello are unable to observe the activities of their customers at all times thereby increasing the likelihood of ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities on their premises in one establishment the investigation revealed holes cut into the partition separating private booths to allow for anonymous genital contact the doors to these private booths lock from the inside which reinforces the ability to become involved in anonymous illicit sexual activity 3 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined herein as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 4 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 5 recent investigation by the pocatello police department found private booths in two 2 sexually oriented businesses in the city of pocatello where there is reason to believe that sexual activity including but not necessarily limited to masturbation is taking place within private booths in one of those establishments 6 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 7 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 8 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea chlamydia human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 9 since 198 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states  600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 198 and 733374  10 as of june 200 there have been 488 reported cases of aids and 353 more reported cases of hiv infection in the state of idaho 11 since 198 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in the state of idaho 12 the number of cases of genital chlamydia in the united states reported annually has risen with 526653 cases reported as of 199 making chlamydia the most reported of all notifiable infectious diseases in the united states 13 while the number of cases of syphilis and gonorrhea has declined the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over 325000 cases being reported in 199 which indicates that the annual decreases in reported cases of gonorrhea may be leveling off 14 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 15 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis chlamydia and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 16 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 17 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 18 recent investigation by the pocatello police department found potentially unhealthy and unsanitary conditions as well as the presence of semen in an adult film viewing booth in an existing sexually oriented business in the city of pocatello idaho 19 the findings noted in subsections a1 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 20 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 21 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 22 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses 23 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from  sterling codifiers inc  71391 working in such establishments 24 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 25 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 26 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 27 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 28 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter  2000  definitions adult arcade any place to which the public is permitted or invited wherein coin operated or slug operated or
