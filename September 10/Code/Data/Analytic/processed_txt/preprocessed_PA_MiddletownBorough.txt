198  1321 title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the curfew   1322 purposes and findings this is an updating of the borough curfew prescribing in accordance with prevailing community standards regulations for the conduct of minors on streets at night effectively enforced taught in the homes internalized and adhered to for generations all for the good of minors for the furtherance of family responsibility and for the public good safety and welfare a the council finds that the curfew meets a very real local need has been over the years a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and should be updated and amplified in the light of middletowns local situation and facts including the following middletown the oldest community in and antedating dauphin county with clearly defined boundaries at the confluence of the susquehanna river and swatara creek to its south and east and crossed at the north by the pennsylvania turnpike has a compact built up area largely within a mile and much of it within a half mile of its police station at the 60 west emaus street borough offices it has near its police station a small central business district and a few manufacturing establishments it is a residential community in an area traditionally classified as pennsylvania dutch after  pm in this quiet community as its people say the sidewalks are rolled up this community sense of the proper time for cessation of outdoor activities by minors on the streets is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this chapter which take into consideration also the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity b the council finds that compact middletown is not overcrowded population density as reflected in the borough comprehensive plan varies by neighborhoods from 437 per acre to 35 to 184 persons per acre the total area is 13047 acres  streets occupy 2288 acres 1638 acres are devoted to public and semipublic uses residential land use predominates and singlefamily dwellings occupy the largest portion of  12723 middletown code  1322   1323 definitions the residential area the population density is 30 persons per acre in that portion of the second ward in eastern middletown south of east main street overlooking the swatara creek now known as the village of pineford a fiftyacre tract which the united states government had acquired while still undeveloped by eminent domain proceedings in 1941  this unique fiftyacre tract is a planned residential development with highrise apartments all owned by one firm providing ample open spaces adequate indoor living space permits minors in middletown to healthfully occupy their time commercial recreational facilities one movie are almost nonexistent and there is little or nothing for minors to do outdoors but roam the streets after the curfew hours which this chapter declares amended 881983 by approved 881983 c the council finds that there are 2841 minors the 1970 census figure for persons under 18 years of age residing in middletown there are fewer than 200 minors for each school grade middletown has three elementary schools one in each of its three wards one junior high school for grades 7 and 8 in the central second ward and one area high school in lower swatara township which adjoins middletown on the west and north the comparatively few minors who reside in the village of pineford include 32 in high school and attending the following schools nearby in the same second ward 25 in junior high and 112 in elementary school d the council further finds that the middletown population 1970 census is 9080 there are 3059 households averaging two and 296 persons per household and as many heads of households in 2069 households there are husband and wife of the 2841 minors 2686 are classified in the 1970 census as own child of the head of the household in which they reside middletown is a stable family community parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm  legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the years  as parental control increases the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases  and there is a continuing need for the nocturnal curfew for minors which has achieved and will continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes hereinbefore stated a for the purposes of the curfew the following terms phrases words and their derivations shall have the meanings given herein borough  the borough of middletown dauphin county pennsylvania with administrative offices at 60 west emaus street middletown pennsylvania 17057 minor  any person under the age of 18 or in equivalent phrasing often herein employed any person 17 or fewer years of age  1322 general provisions  1323  parent  any person having legal custody of a minor remain  to stay behind to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets including the congregating of groups or of interacting minors totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home to implement that thought with additional precision and precaution numerous exceptions are expressly defined in  1325 more and more exceptions become available with increasing years as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended by use of the meaningful phrase be or remain found constitutional in baker v borough of steelton 17 dauph 17 1912amended 591977 by approved 591977 street  a way or place of whatever nature open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel the term street includes the legal rightof way including but not limited to the cartway of traffic lanes the curb the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal rightofway of a street the term street also applies for curfew purposes to ways the public is privileged to use over private property so long as the owner permits including sidewalks and grassplots similarly open at the time to public use and to parking areas of any type residential municipal or commercial open to public use or from such street or any type of street the term street applies irrespective of what it is called or formally named whether alley avenue court road or otherwise or whether it is maintained by the borough and irrespective of whether it is open to the use of the public as a matter of rightamended 881983 by approved 881983 time of night  based upon the prevailing standard of time whether eastern standard time or eastern daylight saving time generally observed at that hour by the public in the borough prima facie the time then observed in the borough administrative offices and police station year of age  continues from one birthday such as the seventeenth to but not including the day of the next such as the eighteenth birthday making it clear that 17 or fewer years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase under 18 years of age the latter phrase in practice unfortunately having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that eighteenyear olds might be involved similarly for example 11 or fewer years of age means under 12 years of age 1 as a natural or adoptive parent  2 as a legal guardian  3 as a person who stands in loco parentis  or as a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of court 4  1323 middletown code  1323   1324 curfew for minors established it shall be unlawful for any person 17 or fewer years of age under 18 to be or remain in or upon the streets within the borough of middletown at night during the period ending at  am and beginning  1325 exceptions b when not inconsistent with the context words used in the present tense include the future words in the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include the plural the word shall is always mandatory and not merely directory a at  pm for minors 11 or fewer years of age b at  pm for minors 12 years or 13 years of age c at  pm for minors 14 or more years of age a in the following exceptional cases a minor on a street within the borough during the nocturnal hours for which  1324 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation and a clear general guide for minors their parents and their fellow citizens shall not however be considered in violation of the curfew amended 591977 by approved 591977  881983 by approved 881983 1 when accompanied by a parent of such minor 2 when accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said parents place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area 3 when exercising first amendment rights protected by the united states constitution such as the free exercise of religion freedom of speech and the right of assembly such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by first delivering to communications center personnel at the borough municipal building at 60 west emaus street where and by whom high priority messages to the mayor are regularly received a written communication signed by such minor and countersigned if practicable by a parent of such minor with their home address and telephone number addressed to the mayor of the borough specifying when where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night during hours when the curfew otherwise applicable to said minor in the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such communication 4 in case of reasonable necessity but only after such minors parent has communicated to the borough police station personnel the facts establishing such reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including  1323 general provisions  1325  points of origin and destination a copy of such communication or of the police record thereof duly certified by the chief of police to be correct with an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and address of such parent and minor shall be admissible evidence 5 when the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides or on the sidewalk of either nextdoor neighbor not communicating an objection to the police officer 6 when returning home by a direct route from and within 30 minutes of the termination of a school activity or an activity of a religious or other voluntary association of which prior notice indicating the place and probable time of termination has been given in writing to and duly filed for immediate reference by the chief of police or the officer assigned by him on duty at the police station thus encouraging here as in other exceptional situations conduct on the part of minors involved in such activities and striking a fair balance for any somewhat conflicting interests 7 when authorized by special permit from the mayor carried on the person of the minor thus authorized as follows when necessary nighttime activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this chapter then recourse may be had to the mayor of the borough either for a regulation as provided in 8 or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant upon the mayors finding of necessity for the use of the streets to the extent warranted by a written application as judicially approved in people v walton 161 p2d 498 502503 cal app 1945 signed by a minor and by a parent of such minor if feasible stating the name age and address of such minor  the name address and telephone number of a parent thereof  the height weight sex color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of such minor  the necessity which requires such minor to remain upon the streets during the curfew hours otherwise applicable  and the street or route and the beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and hour the mayor may grant a permit in writing for the use by such minor of such streets at such hours as in the mayors opinion may reasonably be necessary in an emergency this may be handled by telephone or other effective communication with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously either to the mayor or if unavailable to the police officer authorized by the mayor to act on his behalf in an emergency at the police station 8 when authorized by regulation issued by the mayor in other similar cases of reasonable necessity similarly handled but adapted to necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis normally such regulation by the mayor permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity  1325 middletown code  1325  media and agencies such as the schools and shall define the activity the scope of the use of the streets permitted the period of time involved not to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this curfew 9 when the minor carries a certified card of employment renewable each calendar month when the current facts so warrant dated or reissued not more than 45 days previously signed by the chief of police and briefly identifying the minor the addresses of his home and of his place of employment and his hours of employment 10 when the minor is with parental consent in a motor vehicle this contemplates normal travel from excess of caution this clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement particularly on normal routes such as the pennsylvania turnpike route 230 main street vine street to connect with route 283 route 441 or at times ann street and the wilson street bridge this also exempts interstate travel beginning or ending in middletown 11 when the minor is 17 years of age if and when the mayor shall have determined by formal rule first

be known and may be cited as the borough of middletown stormwater management   2362 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and increased runoff flows and velocities which overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increases the cost to the public to manage stormwater b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes g illicit discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the municipality  2361 general provisions  2363   2363 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and
