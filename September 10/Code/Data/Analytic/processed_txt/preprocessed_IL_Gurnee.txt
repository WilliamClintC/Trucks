the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet surrounding the sign face however screened box signs with raised or routed out letters such signs may be measured as described in paragraph 2 below 2 channel individual letter signs the area of a sign comprised of individual letters or elements attached to a building wall is determined by calculating the area of the smallest geometric figure eg square rectangle circle polygon etc that can be drawn around the letters andor elements signs consisting of individual letters andor elements will be measured as one sign when the distance between the letters andor elements is less than the largest dimension of the largest sign letter 3 multisided signs when the sign faces of a multisided sign are parallel or within 30 degrees of parallel only one side is counted if the sign faces are not parallel or within 30 degrees of parallel all sign faces are counted b rules for measuring building frontage many of the wall sign regulations of this chapter are based on building frontage the following rules govern the measurement of building frontage 1 for buildings occupied by a single tenant or multiple tenants that access the building via a common entrance building frontage is the exterior building wall or walls that 1 is adjacent to a street or a parking area or other vehicle circulation area that is accessory to and serves the subject building and 2 contains either windows or a public building entrance allowed wall sign area for a building that has two or more building frontages must be calculated on the basis of each individual building frontage 2 on buildings housing more than one tenant where each tenant has their own outside entrance a tenants building frontage is the exterior building wall or walls that directly abut the tenants interior floor space and that 1 abuts parallels or is the nearest to parallel with a street or a parking area or other vehicle circulation area that is accessory to and serves the subject building and 2 contains either windows or a public building entrance a tenant that has two or more building frontages must calculate the permitted sign area on the basis of each individual building frontage 3 regardless of the height number of stories or number of tenants in a building building frontage will be determined by one measurement of the horizontal length of the wall at finished grade buildings walls must be measured along a flat unbroken plane regardless of the presence of recesses or projections along the building wall 4 as an alternative to the allocation of permitted sign area on the basis of individual building frontages a differing allotment of sign area may be assigned to the various tenants upon receipt and approval by the zoning administrator of written authorization
