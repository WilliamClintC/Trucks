city of rockland to protect the environment to promote the development of an economically sound and stable community and to provide for the prevention control and abatement of public odor nuisance the city of rockland finds and concludes that because most odorous pollutants have a complex chemical composition and may elicit a broad spectrum of responses by the receptors special methods must be employed in their measurement and characterization although analytical data are more precise and may be useful in identifying a source it is the human ch 10 response or the sensory data that is most critical in determining the necessary degree of odor control analytical data may be used to specify permissible emission levels from a source but sensory data must be employed to assess the impact in the surrounding community the latter is the citys primary concern ii authority and administration a authority this adopted pursuant to 30a mrs  3001 and the citys home rule powers as provided for in a

by minors on the streets is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this takes into consideration also the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity 3 no commercial recreational facilities commercial recreational facilities for juveniles are almost nonexistent and there is little or nothing for minors to do outdoors but roam the streets after the curfew hours which this  parental responsibility parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the years as parental control increases likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases and there is a continuing need for the nocturnal curfew for minors which has achieved and will continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes hereinbefore stated definitions for the purposes of the curfew following terms phrases words and their derivations shall have

including the day of the next such as the eighteenth 18th birthday making it clear that seventeen 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase under eighteen 18 years of age

reserves the right to establish by ordinance or in general or individual wastewater discharge permits more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the wpcf consistent with the purpose of this ordinance dilution as per 40 cfr 4036d except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement no industrial user of the rockland wpcf shall ever increase the use of process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement the rockland wpcf imposes mass limitations on industrial users that are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate massbased limitations 1 pollutant discharge limits in federal categorical pretreatment standards andor in local limits will be expressed either as concentration or mass limits unless the rockland wpcf determines a more stringent approach is necessary wherever possible where concentration limits are specified in these standards equivalent mass limits will be provided so that local state or federal authorities responsible for enforcement may use either concentration or mass limits limits in national categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the effluent of the process regulated by the standard or as otherwise specified by the standard ch 14  when the limits in a national categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the rockland wpcf may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 3 the rockland wpcf shall calculate equivalent massperday limitations by dividing the limits in the standard by the average rate of production this average rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial users actual longterm daily production such as the average daily flow rate during a representative year 4 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the rockland wpcf convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the control authority the rockland wpcf may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all of the following conditions in paragraph c5ia c5ie of this section i to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user shall a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its control mechanism  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass units are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits ii an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits shall a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass units  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow measurement device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the rockland wpcf whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined ion paragraph c5ic of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the rockland wpcf must reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraphs c5ia of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit iii if the rockland wpcf chooses to establish equivalent mass limits then the control authority a shall calculate the equivalent mass limits by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate must reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as the result of the implementation of water ch 14 conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to paragraph d of this section the industrial user shall also be in compliance with regarding the prohibition of bypass iv the rockland wpcf may not express limits in terms of mass for pollutants such as ph temperature radiation or other pollutants that cannot appropriately be expressed as mass 5 the rockland wpcf may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards at 40 cfr parts 414 organic chemicals plastics and synthetic fibers 419 petroleum refining point source category and 455 pesticide chemicals to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users under the following conditions when converting such limits to concentration limits the rockland wpcf must use the concentration listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by paragraph d of this section 6 equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with paragraphs 345 and 6 of this section shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of section 307d of the clean water act and 40 cfr 40c1 the rockland wpcf will document how the equivalent limits were derived and make this information publicly available once incorporated into its control mechanism the industrial user shall comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 7 many categorical pretreatment standards andor industrial wastewater discharge permits specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production of flow value shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation 8 any industrial user operating under a control mechanism incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production based standard shall notify the rockland wpcf within two 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the rockland wpcf of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its control

federal state or local building and safety codes may require note see for the definitions of nonconforming structures nonconforming uses and nonconforming lots c nonconforming structures 1 expansions a nonconforming structure may be added to or expanded after obtaining a permit from the same permitting authority as that for a new structure if such addition or expansion does not increase the nonconformity of the structure and is in accordance with subparagraphs a and b below a after  if any portion of a structure is less than the required setback from the normal highwater line of a water body or tributary stream or the upland edge of a wetland that portion of the structure ch 19 shall not be expanded as measured in floor area or volume by 30% or more during the lifetime of the structure if a replacement structure conforms with the requirements of c3 and is less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland the replacement structure may not be expanded if the original structure existing on  had been expanded by 30% in floor area and volume since that date b whenever a new enlarged or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure the structure and new foundation must be placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee basing its decision on the criteria specified in c2 relocation below if the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure except for expansion in conformity with c1a above and the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three 3 additional feet as measured from the uphill side of the structure from original ground level to the bottom of the first floor sill it shall not be considered to be an expansion of the structure 2 relocation a nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee and provided that the applicant demonstrates that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes the structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the planning board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting shall be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree three 3 feet in height for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be reestablished an area at least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a structure is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 3 reconstruction or replacement any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed or damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within eighteen 18 months of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the planning board or its designee in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pursuant to 1 above as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location if the total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated or reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structure when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted in accordance with 2 above ch 19 in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the planning board or its designee shall consider in addition to the criteria in c2 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed by 50% or less of the market value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal 4 change of use of a nonconforming structure the use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the planning board after receiving a written application determines that the new use will have no greater adverse impact on the water body tributary stream or wetland or on the subject or adjacent properties and

parking spaces except spaces intended for employee use must be located within 600 feet the lot on which the principal use is located satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance approved by the permitissuing authority 3 the developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present satisfactory written evidence that he owns the land or has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces and must specify the length of time for which the permission is granted ie 5 yr minimum subject to renewal the developer must also sign an acknowledgment that the continuing validity of his permit approval depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces 4 the permitissuing authority shall consider the extent to which any satellite parking area meets the design requirements in determining if the satellite parking will be counted in meeting the minimum number of spaces required by the ordinance b mixed uses where a building or lot serves more than one use the number of required offstreet parking spaces serving such building or lot shall be the sum of the requirements for all of the various uses except as allowed in below c shared use of parking facilities the permitissuing authority may approve the shared use of a parking facility by two or more buildings or uses provided the owners or lessees have clearly demonstrated that the shared use of the parking facility would substantially meet the requirements of this to variations in the time of day or days of use by the residents patrons and employees of the buildings or uses to be served by the parking facility for example a parking lot used on monday for an office building could be partly used by a flea market operating only on weekends or for an adjacent churches sunday morning services the permitissuing authority may require a contract between proposed users of a shared parking facility as a condition of approval of such shared use the provisions of a location of offstreet parking are also applicable if satellite parking spaces are involved d parking

required to make up any deficit that may attend the original building or structure if such building or structure was in lawful existence at the time of adoption of this expansion of a structure which does not increase the need for offstreet parking shall not be required to provide additional parking spaces however subsequent changes to the expansion which result in any greater deficit will require additional parking to be provided for the expansion in accordance with j table of parking requirements this subsection shall not apply to expansions of use within the downtown parking district as defined in  e in the case of a change of use the required number of spaces shall be the number of spaces required for the new use itself minus the number of spaces which were required for the original use whether or not such original use if in lawful existence at the time of adoption of this actually provided its required number of spaces vacant or abandoned buildings or spaces for which the original use cannot be determined shall be deemed to have required one 1 space per three hundred fifty 350 square feet of gross floor area this subsection shall not apply to changes of use within the downtown parking district as defined in  ch 19 f in no case shall the number dimensions location or layout of offstreet parking spaces or areas as authorized by the permitissuing authority be altered

the j may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs the former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots the latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space therefore as suggested in the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of j and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in a in making the determination to allow or require a deviation the permitissuing authority shall consider a parking plan drawn to scale and all available information concerning the specific proposal and similar developments such as sales reports or computer printouts from other branches or similar operations  national standards  information from headquarters for franchises etc and adequate land area available if necessary for enlarging the parking area b without limiting the generality of the foregoing the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the from the parking requirements set forth in e when it finds that 1 a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly  2 a business is primarily oriented to walkin trade c whenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in j it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation d if the permitissuing authority concludes based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal that the presumption established by j for a particular use classification is erroneous it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of parking requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in e when site conditions or other constraints prevent full compliance with design standards for offstreet parking the permit issuing authority may accept alternative designs that are not in full compliance with said section provided that reasonable and accepted standards are used and that the variation does not result in unsafe

configuration building materials texture color and location on a lot as will be compatible with existing buildings or blocks of buildings in the area and with streets and open space to which it is visually related and in keeping with the area in areas of the city where structures have little or no historic value new construction or renovations shall enhance the area rather than replicate existing structures these standards shall not apply to structures in the industrial zone downtown zone or tillson avenue area overlay zone the downtown and tillson avenue area overlay zones are subject to design standards set forth in b in areas of the city that are rural in nature and have no clear pattern or style of construction these standards shall be used as guidelines for future development to achieve visual compatibility throughout these standards compatibility is not meant to mean uniformity residential new construction or renovations that do not require planning board approval under the provisions of of this not require planning board review under the provisions of this the officer denies a building permit because of the provisions herein 2 special standards new construction or renovations shall be visually compatible or superior in terms of a height the height of the proposed building or additions to existing buildings relate the overall height of new construction to that of neighboring structures as a general rule construct new buildings to a height comparable to the average height of existing buildings from the historic period on the same side of and across the street avoid new construction that greatly varies in height too high or too low from older buildings in the vicinity b proportion of buildings front facade and massing the relationship of the width of the building to the height of the front elevation should be visually compatible with buildings structures and open spaces where it is visually related in reviewing a proposed new building or structure or additions to existing buildings break up uninteresting boxlike forms into smaller varied masses comparable to the historic structures or blocks of buildings from the historic period variety of form and massing are often elements essential to the character of the historic streetscape ch 19 avoid single monolithic forms that are not relieved by variations in massing boxlike facades and forms are intrusive when placed in a streetscape of older buildings that have varied massing and facade articulation c relationship of solids to voids in front facades the relationship of solids to voids in the front facade of a building should be visually compatible with that of buildings to which it is visually related in reviewing a proposed new building or structure or addition to an existing building respect the recurrent alternation of wall areas with door and window elements in the facade also consider the widthtoheight ratio of bays in the facade the placement of openings with respect to the facades overall composition symmetry or balanced asymmetry should be studies d spacing of buildings on streets the relationship of the building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings should be visually compatible with those of buildings to which it is visually related when zoning regulations permit e entrance andor porch projection setback the relationship of entrance and porch projections to sidewalks and streets should be visually compatible with those of buildings to which it is visually related in reviewing a proposed new building or structure or an addition to an existing building maintain the historic facade lines of streetscapes by locating front walls of new buildings in the same plane as the facades of neighboring buildings when zoning regulations permit if exceptions are made buildings should be set back into the lot rather than closer to the street if existing setbacks vary new buildings should conform to historic siting patterns avoid violating the existing setback pattern by placing new buildings in front of or behind the historic facade avoid placing buildings at odd angles to the street unless in an area where diverse siting exists even if proper setback is maintained ch 19 f materials textures and color the relationship of materials textures and color of the facade of a building should be visually compatible either with that of the predominant materials used in the buildings to which it is visually related or compatible with materials traditionally used in the city g roof shapes the roof shape of a building should be visually compatible with that of the buildings to which it is visually related when no clear pattern exists a roof pitch of 512 or steeper should be used or the building should be designed so as to appear to have a pitched roof in reviewing a proposed new building or structure or an addition to an existing building relate the roof forms of the new building to those found in the area although not entirely necessary duplication of the existing or traditional roof shapes pitches and materials in new construction is one way of making new structures more visually compatible avoid introducing roof shapes pitches or materials not traditionally used in the area h scale of buildings the size of the building the mass of the building in relation to open spaces the window door openings porches and balconies should be visually compatible with those characteristics of buildings and spaces to which it is visually related in reviewing a proposed new building or structure or addition to an existing building relate the size and proportions of new structures to the scale of neighboring buildings although much larger than its neighbors in terms of square footage the building shown maintains the same scale and rhythm as the existing buildings avoid buildings that in height width or massing violate the existing scale of the area the new building shown here disrupts the scale and rhythm of the streetscape although it might be appropriate in a different location i directional expression of front elevation a building should be visually compatible with the building squares and places to which it is visually related in its directional character whether this is vertical character horizontal character or nondirectional character this provision is not intended to apply to residential subdivisions covered in of this in reviewing a proposed new building or structure or addition to an existing building relate the vertical horizontal or nondirectional facade character of new buildings to the predominant directional expression of nearby buildings horizontal buildings can be made to relate to the more vertical neighboring structures by breaking the facade into smaller masses that conform to the primary expression of the streetscape as shown below 3 applicability  alternate proposals the above design standards shall be adhered to within all zones within the city except in the industrial zone downtown zone or tillson avenue area overlay zone however that alternative proposals of exceptional design merit that meet the spirit and intent of these standards may be accepted by the planning board eff  b minimum architectural design standards  downtown zone and tillson avenue area overlay zone 1 policy and purpose the 2005 tillson district & waterfront redevelopment plan called for public infrastructure improvements and zoning changes to foster the expansion of the downtown into the tillson and waterfront area including the establishment of urban design standards to ensure both the preservation of the working waterfront on crocketts point and the new england character of an extended downtown the city finds that requiring consistently high quality design and adherence to the following design standards will best ensure these goals economic development in the city generally and the protection and enhancement of the value and redevelopment potential of property subject to the standards these design standards are intended to achieve in an extended downtown and redeveloped waterfront a balance between historic architecture and a differentiated modern built environment 2 terminology diagram and examples are for illustrative purposes only 3 applicability no building or structure may be constructed or substantially renovated in the downtown zone or tillson avenue area overlay zone unless the planning board first determines that the architectural plans and elevations for such building satisfy the architectural design standards set forth in this subsection  provided however that in the tillson avenue overlay zone the architectural design standards set forth in this section shall not apply to a building the primary use of which is proposed for one or more functionally water dependent uses nor may any building or structure that is to be converted from a primary functionally waterdependent use to another use be substantially rehabilitated or renovated in the downtown zone or tillson avenue area overlay zone without such planning board determination the officer shall not issue any building permit for a building subject to such design standards without such planning board approval and shall not issue a certificate of occupancy that does not comply with the plans and elevations upon which the planning board based its approval for the purposes of this subsection substantially renovated shall mean additions to or the reconstruction or repair of a structure at a cost over a ten year period of 75% or more of the preconstruction assessed value of the structure ch 19 substantially renovated shall also include the repair reconstruction or replacement of a structure that is removed damaged or destroyed by more than fifty percent 50% of its assessed value by fire flood storm or other hazard risk loss or act not at the volition or under the control of the owner or occupant of such structure

notify the chair of the planning board and schedule the application for review by the planning board which review shall be performed in conjunction with site plan review where applicable the applicant shall provide the office with plans andor elevations depicting the architectural features and materials proposed for the facades of the building and details of specific architectural lighting landscaping and other pertinent features that the applicant represents satisfies these architectural design standards together with any and all other plans and materials required for site plan review or a building permit as may be applicable 5 findings the planning board shall approve an application received pursuant to this section unless the board finds that the building or structure would if erected or substantially renovated result in a marked absence of architectural elements characteristic of the predominant architecture of structures on main street between park and lindsey street
