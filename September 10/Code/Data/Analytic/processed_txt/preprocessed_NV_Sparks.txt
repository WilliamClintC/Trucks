pollutant in wastewater the public works director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with e and f b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the public works director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c the public works director shall calculate the equivalent massperday limitations under b by multiplying the limits in the standard by the industrial users average rate of production this average rate of production shall be based not upon the designed production capacity but rather upon a reasonable measure of the industrial users actual longterm daily production such as the average daily production during a representative year for new sources actual production shall be estimated using projected production d the public works director shall calculate the equivalent concentration limitations under b by dividing the mass limitations derived under c by the average daily flow rate of the industrial users regulated process wastewater this average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the industrial users actual longterm average flow rate such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year e when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the public works director the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in a e below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the public works director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in c upon notification of a revised production rate the public works director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to a so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the public works director a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment the industrial user must also be in compliance with this title regarding the prohibition of bypass f the public works director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts

operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the public works director within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the public works director of such anticipated change will be

industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of paragraph 2 of this subsection are met 2 criteria a either i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters b credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere c credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section d credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will

appropriate add  bypass provisions a definitions 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b bypass not violating applicable pretreatment standards or requirements an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this section c notice 1 if an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice

standards to the public works director within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the public works director may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours d prohibition of bypass 1 bypass is prohibited and the public works director may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless  a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  and c the industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph c of this section 2 the public works director may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the public works director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in  amended   add  upset a for the purposes of this section upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error

orientation _____ varied garage placements and orientation where smc permits garages can be entered from the front or side of the structure _____ traditional design with alley the use of public alleys in a subdivision will place the garage and vehicular traffic access off the alley and not the front of the home alleyloaded garages may utilize drive aprons whereas alleyloaded driveways are prohibited _____ combined front and rear setbacks the combined front and rear setback requirements otherwise required for a conventional development are combined the development may reduce the front and rear setback but the combined total front and rear setback is equal to the conventional development this allows a variety of setback combinations if this option is used setbacks cannot be reduced below the following minimums  front 75 feet  rear 15 feet a 20foot driveway length is required for a garage to accommodate required offstreet parking therefore a garage may not utilize the specific flexibility reduction in setbacks as depicted above alley loaded garages are exempt from this flexibility as the garage is permitted to be at the rear property line the example below shows this option

neighborhoods   reduce infill and redevelopment barriers by allowing for more compact parking configurations that maximize the efficiency of onsite parking and increases buildable areas   provide a continuous and easily accessible pedestrian circulation network   provide an onsite pedestrian network providing direct access to transit and the corridorwide pedestrian circulation network   maintain a welldefined pattern of urban blocks that provide frequent pedestrian connections to adjacent neighborhoods and serve as a framework for a varied mix of uses  and  ensure that activity centers are integrated with rather than walledoff from adjacent neighborhoods 1 applicability a an addition or renovation project proposed in a mixeduse district where the total square footage of the proposed addition is less than 50 percent of the total square footage of the existing primary structure is subject to parking requirements in is not eligible for the incentives provided in this publiclyowned lands within the downtown redevelopment area are governed by the redevelopment plan and design guidelines prepared by the redevelopment agency rather than this routine improvements these regulations do not apply to 1 the renovation of an existing singlefamily home  or 2 the routine maintenance and repair of a structure or other feature on the site such as roof replacement or general repairs to a parking area or other site feature 2 street classifications for purposes of applying these standards the mixeduse districts are divided into primary streets and secondary streets as follows primary streets this is a street with frontage that is restricted to building types and uses that promote pedestrian activity and which benefit from pedestrian andor transit access prater way victorian avenue and the portion of lincoln way between sparks blvd and mccarran blvd are designated as primary streets secondary streets a street that accommodates a variety of building and site design categories including service loading and parking frontages this may include large floor plate commercial uses or uses with front loaded parking for which there is a current market demand but that may be redeveloped or augmented in the future as transit service increases and market demand shifts a secondary designation may be considered an interim designation as part of a phased development plan 3

shall provide a preliminary grading plan showing 1 approximate street grades  2 approximate pad and floor elevations  3 approximate location and grading of major cut and fill slopes as defined by the administrator  4 approximate location and height of retaining walls at least six feet in height  and 5 slopes steeper than 33 percent  and six feet in height c slope analysis 1 a slope analysis map with slope category breakdown shall be provided as provided below 2 a slope or cell map shall be developed which groups small areas of similar slope together gridded at a maximum interval to be determined by the administrator the slope categories or groups shall be as listed below this establishes the maximum disturbed area within each slope category over the entire site 3 specified maximum disturbed areas can be used as thresholds which can only be exceeded after demonstration that the additional grading provides a better solution demonstration of a better solution must address the following three design policies a the site of the proposed development shall be analyzed to identify the design constraints imposed by hydrological and geological conditions soils slopes and other natural topographic conditions in order to secure a tentative approval the project shall respect the natural constraints in the design of the development b the development shall be designed with consideration for limiting aesthetic degradation of the site as well as erosion sedimentation and other hazards c buildings should be designed and placed on the site so as to visually complement each other and the natural land forms of the site the placement of buildings on or near hilltops or ridges is to show a high degree of sensitivity to the terrain and its visual impact definitive plans shall be prepared that clearly demonstrate this sensitivity for project approval exh a add  appendix a8  supplemental information for development on slopes hilltops and ridges a applicability this section applies to any development that is subject to development on slopes hilltops and ridges b additional conditional use permit application requirements in addition to the application contents
