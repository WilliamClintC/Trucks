purpose of this article is to recognize and to provide for the fact that the operation of adult establishments and mechanical amusement devices a preponderance of which businesses and devices are to depict or display specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas results in increased enforcement problems of the city and additional expense to the city that justifies a license fee for these establishments and devices this follows because it is not immediately possible to distinguish between constitutionally protected nonobscene depictions or portrayals of explicit sexual conduct from nonconstitutionally protected obscene portrayals of sexual conduct this necessitates greater police vigilance to ensure that the lawful business of displaying nonobscene portrayals or depictions of sexual conduct is not used inadvertently or by design as the means of unlawfully displaying or depicting obscenity an additional enforcement obligation is directed to the necessity to restrict

regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects and concentrations of adult entertainment establishments within the city the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to

california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma county oklahoma  cleveland ohio  dallas texas  tucson arizona  st croix county wisconsin  bellevue washington  newport news virginia  new york new york  phoenix arizona  and from summaries of several of the foregoing secondary effects reports  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the board finds 1 adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that cause deleterious secondary effects in the establishments and in the areas surrounding them this article is designed to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible within constitutional boundaries for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of unregulated adult entertainment establishments defined in this article as adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at unregulated adult entertainment establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films or videos or live sexually oriented shows 4 offering and providing such unregulated space encourages unsanitary activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult cabarets adult arcades and other adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activities within the premises of such adult entertainment establishments or for the purpose of purchasing or selling illicit drugs 6 numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult entertainment establishments 7 according to research from the kaiser family foundation an estimated 650000 to 900000 americans are infected with hiv the number of new hiv infections occurring each year is now about 41000 men and women of all races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact 8 the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that as many as one in three people with hiv do not know they are infected 9 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 cases of 1990 10 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over 500000 cases being reported in 1990 11 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 12 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 13 sanitary conditions in some adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 14 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of adult entertainment establishments where persons view adultoriented films and live sexual shows 15 the findings noted in subsections b1 b14 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 16 adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 17 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult entertainment establishments further such a licensing procedure will give an incentive to the operators to see that the adult entertainment establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment establishment in ultimate possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 18 removal of doors on adult booths cubicles or individual viewing areas and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments 19 requiring licensees of adult establishments to keep information regarding current and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 20 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the adult establishment where such information is substantially related to significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 21 in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 22 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 23 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 24 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of this article 101   6242003 standards

capital improvements extensions or additions to said utility the following provisions shall at all times be observed 1 for the purpose of this section whenever the net revenues of the utility hereinabove appropriated to the improvement warrant account are pledged to pay a portion of the cost of any improvement to be financed by improvement warrants such warrants and the interest accruing thereon shall be deemed to be payable from said net revenues in the same proportion as that part of the cost payable from said net revenues bears to the principal amount of such warrants  and the portion of such cost payable from net revenues shall be deemed equal to the principal amount of the warrants less the principal amount of the taxes and assessments agreed to be levied for the payment thereof 2 except as provided in subsections 3 and 4 of this section no obligations shall be issued and made payable from the revenue bond account or the improvement warrant account at any time unless the net revenues of the utility as defined in subsection 2 of section 11736 received during the then next preceding fiscal year shall have been in an aggregate amount at least equal to 125 percent of the average annual principal and interest payments due on all bonds payable from the revenue bond account which are then outstanding or then to be issued plus percentage of the average of the annual principal and interest payments due on each issue of improvement warrants then outstanding or then to be issued as shall be payable from said net revenues which averages shall be computed on the basis of the principal and interest payments due in the fiscal years of the then remaining term of all such revenue bonds and improvement warrants then outstanding for the purpose of such computation whenever rates for potable water sanitary sewer or stormwater service have been changed in the course of any fiscal year the net revenues for such year shall be deemed to be those which would have been received if such amended rates had been in effect during the entirety of such years based upon the actual quantities of service furnished to each class of customers and the actual expenses of the utility during such year  provided that in no case shall the net revenues so computed be deemed to exceed 125 percent of the net revenues actually received during such year 3 refunding revenue bonds may be issued for the purpose of prepaying and refunding bonds payable from the revenue bond account when and as they become prepayable according to their terms in the manner and to the extent permitted by law provided that such refunding revenue bonds shall be subject to the requirements set forth in subsection 2 of this section as applied to the past net revenues and future principal and interest requirements as of the date of the issuance of such refunding revenue bonds however the city shall and does also reserve the right and privilege of issuing refunding revenue bonds when

account are insufficient and cannot be made sufficient by transfer of moneys from other accounts and such refunding revenue bonds shall be payable from the revenue bond account on a parity as to interest with all then outstanding bonds payable therefrom but the maturities of such refunding revenue bonds shall be subsequent to the maturities of all such outstanding bonds nothing herein shall be deemed to require the holder of any revenue bond to accept a refunding revenue bond in exchange therefor 4 the city also reserves the right and privilege of issuing refunding improvement warrants in the manner and to the extent provided in ndcc ch 4027 the lien and charge of such refunding warrants on the net revenues appropriated to the improvement warrant account shall be the same as that in

that facilitate the identification and investigation of noncompliance are as follows 1 industrial user inventory  an essential step for identifying noncompliance is knowing who is discharging nondomestic waste to the potw where they are located and the nature of the nondomestic waste being discharged the industrial pretreatment coordinator maintains a current inventory of all nondomestic sources of waste to the potw 2 monitoring and inspection plan  the industrial pretreatment coordinator prepares an annual monitoring and inspection plan the control authority monitors the wastewater from each significant industrial user siu at least once per year the control authority requires all sampling and analysis to be performed in accordance with 40 cfr 136 control authority sampling procedures including quality assurancequality control procedures discussed elsewhere in the approved pretreatment program document are followed to maximize sample integrity a a comprehensive inspection of each siu is conducted by the control authority at least once per year the control authority follows inspection procedures discussed elsewhere in the approved pretreatment program to ensure consistent thorough and welldocumented inspections b information gathered during control authority industrial user monitoring and inspections is used to verify industrial user compliance status and to determine if enforcement response must be initiated or continued 3 compliance screening  all reports from industrial users and reports generated by the control authority are carefully reviewed on an asreceived basis for timeliness completeness and accuracy the screening process includes a signatorycertification requirements monitoring frequency etc h description of enforcement actions  informal notice  1 verbal notification  verbal notification by telephone or in person provide an immediate notification of violations in general verbal notifications are used for minor isolated violations or as an initial step leading to an escalated enforcement response all verbal notifications related to enforcement or the investigation of suspected violations are documented in writing and placed in the respective industrial user file 2 warning letter  warning letters wls are issued under the same circumstances as verbal notifications they may be issued as followup letters to verbal notifications or in lieu of verbal notifications 3 informal meeting  an informal meeting is used to gather information concerning noncompliance discuss steps to alleviate noncompliance and determine the commitment level of the industrial user all informal meetings are documented in the citys files 4 notice of violation  a notice of violation nov is a written notice to the noncompliant industrial user that a pretreatment violation has occurred a nov includes a statement detailing the legal authority under which the control authority issued the nov a description of the violation and the date the violation occurred the nov requires a response from the industrial user that details the causes of the violation and the corrective actions taken to correct the violation and prevent similar violations from occurring in general novs are considered to be more stringent enforcement responses than warning letters 5 administrative order  administrative orders aos are enforcement documents that direct industrial users to undertake andor to cease specified activities by specified deadlines the terms of an ao may or may not be negotiated with industrial users aos may incorporate compliance schedules administrative penalties termination of service and show cause orders an administrative order is the minimum level of enforcement used to address significant noncompliance 6 show cause hearing  a show cause hearing is a formal meeting requiring the industrial user to appear explain its noncompliance and show cause as to why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not go forward the meeting may also serve as a forum to discuss corrective action and compliance schedules 7 termination of service  termination of service is the revocation of an industrial users privilege to discharge nondomestic wastewater into the sanitary sewer system termination of service is used when the discharge from an industrial user presents imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment or threatens to interfere with the potws operations or as an escalating enforcement action to a significant violation when a noncompliant industrial user fails to respond adequately to previous enforcement actions termination of service may be accomplished by physical severance of the industrial users connection to the collection system issuance of an ao cease and desist order which compels the iu to immediately terminate its discharge revocation of the ius discharge permit or a court ruling 8 administrative fines  an administrative fine is a punitive monetary charge assessed by the control authority rather than a court the penalty authority must be authorized in the potws local legal authority the purpose of the fine is to recover the economic benefit of noncompliance and to deter violations when assessing an administrative fine the following factors are considered a type and severity of the violation b number of violations cited c duration of noncompliance d impact of the violation on the receiving water sludge quality and potw operation e whether the violation threatened public health f the economic benefit or savings the industrial user gained from the noncompliance g compliance history of the industrial user h whether the industrial user is making a good faith effort to comply 9 civil litigation  civil litigation is the formal process whereby the control authority files a lawsuit against the industrial user to secure courtordered action to correct violations and to secure penalties for the violations including recovery of cost to the potw for the noncompliance civil litigation also includes enforcement measures which require involvement or approval of the court such as injunctive relief 10 referral to the epa or the state  where a potw does not rely on criminal prosecution for its enforcement authority referral to the state or the epa may be made for violations that may warrant criminal prosecution the control authority will refer the case to the epa or the state for further action circumstances that trigger the epa or state referrals include evidence of willfulness evidence of negligence and bad faith shown by the industrial user i enforcement response guide  1 purpose  the enforcement response guide erg designates several enforcement options for each type or pattern of noncompliance the intent of the erg is to provide direction for appropriate enforcement response and to ensure consistent enforcement for similar violations and circumstances factors that will be evaluated when determining the appropriate response are as follows a good faith of the user b compliance history of the user c previous success of the enforcement actions against the user eg if historically novs have not been effective in returning the user to compliance in a reasonable period of time an administrative order would be a more appropriate response d violations effect on the environment andor public health e violations effect on the potw 2 options for noncompliance  a violations resulting in significant noncompliance any violation that results in significant noncompliance snc will be addressed enforcement action regardless of the enforcement response otherwise dictated by the enforcement response guide the minimum level of enforcement used to address snc is an ao b escalating enforcement response escalating enforcement response will be used for recurring violations and failure to achieve compliance subsequent to informal or formal enforcement a recurring violation is one in which the same type of violation occurs on consecutive reporting periods the violation occurs seasonally or any other pattern of noncompliance is shown c violations falling under more than one category violations that fall under more than one category in the enforcement response guide will be addressed more severe enforcement response all alleged violations will be included in the more severe response d timeframes for enforcement response 1 all violations will be identified and documented within five days of receiving compliance information 2 initial enforcement responses informal or formal will occur within 15 days of identifying a violation 3 follow up actions for continuing or recurring violations will be taken within 60 days of the initial enforcement response 4 violations which threaten health property or environmental quality are considered emergencies and will receive immediate response such as halting the discharge or terminating service 5 all violations meeting the criteria for significant noncompliance will be addressed within 30 days of the identification of significant noncompliance j guidelines  noncompliance severity of violation enforcement action
