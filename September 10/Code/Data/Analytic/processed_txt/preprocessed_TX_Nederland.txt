regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material b findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings meetings and in reports made available to the council and on studies in other communities including but not limited to beaumont texas  jefferson county texas  phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  and cleveland ohio the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses may lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that presently are sometimes uncontrolled by the managers of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for certain activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation oral and anal sex may easily occur at sexually oriented businesses which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which may create unhealthy conditions 5 many communicable diseases may be spread by activities which may occur in sexually oriented businesses 6 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 7 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 6 raise substantial governmental concerns 8 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 9 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of and those conducting any business in the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its customers and employees as well as the citizens of the city 10 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity which may occur in such booths 11 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 12 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses may aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 13 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees and other persons who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 14 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of time serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 15 barring alcohol from adult clubs is supported by evidence of experiences of other urban areas and local police reports of criminal activity around adult clubs which serve alcohol and will advance the important governmental interests of preventing crime and neighborhood deterioration 16 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will

city of nederland are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art i  b 121012 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control

area art i  c 121012 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4

any proposed project where a private street is intended to serve two or more separate lots or individual building sites designed for sale to the general public b general arrangement and layout the pattern or layout of the street system in any project should provide for the following basic design concepts 1 provide adequate vehicular access to all buildings and facilities within the plat boundaries 2 provide adequate interior traffic circulation and access to all buildings containing dwelling units by firefighting personnel and equipment as approved by the fire official 3 provide adequate access to the existing public street system adjacent to the boundaries of the plat 4 be so designed to allow for the smooth flow of vehicular traffic avoiding such traffic hazards as closely offset intersections angular and multiple point intersections jogs and other design features which would induce a hazard to vehicular traffic and the occupants of the project c width since private streets are established without the benefit of a formalized rightofway width the width of a private street is considered by the city to be the width of the surface of the pavement measured from edge to edge under these circumstances the rightofway width and the pavement width of a private street are considered coterminous and the terms are used interchangeably it is the policy of the city that the minimum acceptable unobstructed width of any private street should not be less than 27 feet if designated parking is proposed along the private street additional width may be required to
