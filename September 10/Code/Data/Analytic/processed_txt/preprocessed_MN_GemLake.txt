district 91 the intent of the gem lake gateway district gateway or g is intended to allow for development and redevelopment of the real property associated with hoffman corner and points westward along ramsey county road e extending northward to the border with the zoning districts identified in of this area has been the subject of a visioning study and includes both commercial and residential opportunities as described in the city of gem lake comprehensive plan and other city documents as introduced by the visioning plan and envisioned by the comprehensive plan the gateway will emphasize commercial development andor redevelopment in the hoffman corner intersection which traditionally has been the location of the gem lake commercial district as one moves westward along county road e the intent of the gateway is to transition into more residential type neighborhoods becoming less dense until it transitions to either the estate residential district or the executive residential district  purposes specifically the gateway zoning district will attempt to a promote development and redevelopment consistent with the visioning plan for the gateway area by encouraging residential uses in conjunction with commercial and expanded recreational activities which in turn will create an active street life while enhancing the vitality of businesses and reducing vehicular traffic b provide for mixeduse developments that are carefully planned to promote efficient use of land parking and roadway systems c provide enhanced oversight use permit provisions to ensure compatibility of mixed uses and consistency with the approved master plan for the site d ensure compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods e provide significant incentives to promote mixeduse redevelopment projects f encourage sustainable architectural engineering and landscape design that is implemented by responsive green construction practices g preserve natural resources minimize the carbon footprint of the city and establish a key zone within gem lake that is respectful of neighboring areas and is instructive for future generations h encourage pedestrian and bicycle use i ensure that commercial and residential uses in a development are designed to be compatible with each other j ensure high standards of site design spatial relationships architectural design building materials and landscape design k seek to put in place those areas identified in the comprehensive plan as supported by the master plan that includes four subzones 1 neighborhood edge intended for lower density singlefamily residential housing development to act as a transition between new mixeduse construction and existing singlefamily detached structures on adjacent lands this subzone in its basic form will accommodate singlefamily dwellings on larger lots or with application of incentives more compact homes on common larger lots or on compact lots with enhanced buffers used in clustering shared with accessory buildings and generally served from a front or side driveway 2 neighborhood general intended to begin the transition from purely residential use at low densities to more intensive mixeduse development at the districts center this subzone will accommodate a variety of residential structures at varying densities and also begin to integrate lowerimpact office or retail activities which complement the residential setting gem lake zoning  3 neighborhood mixed use intended to establish a neighborhood focus that is distinguished by mixed use buildings together with denser residential options and smallerscale commercial and office buildings without residential components this subzone will accommodate a variety of activities and services within easy walking distance from homes throughout the district supporting daily convenience shopping and personal service needs and also providing opportunities for public gathering and social contact 4 neighborhood center intended for the most urban conditions within all of the shown mixed use areas the mixture of land uses emphasizes groundfloor retail with offices and residentialrental above as market acceptance matures and structures providing commercial space for medium and largesized retailers street frontages throughout this subzone should be pedestrianoriented and the public space should be defined by placing building facades at the edge of the sidewalk neighborhood center land that abuts other subzones on the north and west sides will be carefully planned to ensure lowerdensity buildings  definitions specific to this terms

this lake zoning  garden overlay district findings and purpose  the city council makes the following findings a the landuse plans of the city of gem lake historically have not assigned any land in the city for longterm agricultural use as the city has developed and continues to develop as a primarily residential community surrounded by fully developed suburban neighborhoods the city council reaffirms the citys intent to encourage development of the city in accordance with its adopted comprehensive plans b at the time this considered large land parcels in the city have yet to develop any primary use and stand vacant additional largelot property in the city is projected to subdivide and develop into smaller lots over the next 10 to 30 years the city council recognizes that economic conditions are not always favorable for real estate development and that the costs to carry vacant land can create pressures that promote suboptimal development permitting smallscale agriculture as a primary use will allow owners of large undeveloped parcels to qualify for agricultural tax classification and thus lower tax payments without affecting the longterm plans for the land the council finds that providing this means to temporarily ease this pressure will enhance the citys ability to fully realize the goals of its comprehensive plans c several cities and metropolitan areas are placing a greater emphasis on local food production as a means of improving public health allowing the use of available space in the city for community gardens or market gardens to grow food will promote local food production and improve public health in gem lake and the surrounding community d as an interim use of land subject to the regulations proposed community gardening and market gardening will be compatible with all allowed land uses in the city of gem lake and with the goals of the citys comprehensive plan  the council intends that the garden overlay district be available to

sometimes referred to herein as the or this intent and purpose 21 purpose the purpose of this to control zoning regulations certain land uses that have a direct and detrimental effect on the character of the city of gem lakes residential and commercial districts 22 findings the city council makes the following findings about the effect adult uses and sexually oriented businesses have on the character of the citys neighborhoods in making the findings the city council accepts the recommendations of the citys planning commission which has studied the experiences of other urban areas about such businesses and has held a public hearing to solicit input on the contents of this the city council is aware of a study conducted by the minnesota attorney general which examined the impact that sexually oriented adult establishments have in cities in minnesota and throughout the country this study concluded that adult establishments have an adverse impact on surrounding neighborhoods those impacts included increased crime rates lower property values increased transiency neighborhood blight and potential health risks in addition the city council is also aware that the cities surrounding gem lake have adopted ordinances regulating adult uses and sexually oriented businesses indicating that such ordinances were deemed important and necessary in the communities surrounding gem lake based on the studies and findings the city council concludes a adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can contribute to an increase in crime in the area where such businesses are located this can be a burden upon law enforcement services b adult uses and sexually oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can increase neighborhood blight these businesses can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area where such businesses are located this situation could lessen the amount of desirable housing for residents c adult uses and sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary impacts of the types described in a and b above d it is necessary to provide for the special and express regulation o f businesses establishments or commercial enterprises that operate as adult body painting studios adult bookstores adult cabarets adult car washes adult companionship establishments adult hotels or

premises e the commercial enterprises such as the types described in d above and all other similar establishments whose services include sessions offered to adults conducted in private by members of the same or opposite sex and employing personnel with no specialized training are susceptible to operations contravening subverting or endangering the morals of the city by being the site of acts of prostitution illicit sex and occasions of violent crimes and thus requiring close inspection licensing and regulation f control and regulation of commercial establishments of these types in view of the abuses often perpetrated require intensive efforts by law enforcement and other governmental functions of the city increased and concentrated use of city services for such control and regulation detracts from and reduces the level of services available to the rest of the city thus these types of establishments can diminish the ability of the city to protect and promote the general health welfare morals and safety of the city  2  g the city council adopts the landuse and licensing regulations in this article recognizing that it has an interest in the present and future character of the

development  gem lake gateway district 91 the intent of the gem lake gateway district gateway or g is intended to allow for development and redevelopment of the real property associated with hoffman corner and points westward along ramsey county road e extending northward to the border with the zoning districts identified in of this area has been the subject of a visioning study and includes both commercial and residential opportunities as described in the city of gem lake comprehensive plan and other city documents as introduced by the visioning plan and envisioned by the comprehensive plan the gateway will emphasize commercial development andor redevelopment in the hoffman corner intersection which traditionally has been the location of the gem lake commercial district as one moves westward along county road e the intent of the gateway is to transition into more residential type neighborhoods becoming less dense until it transitions to either the estate residential district or the executive residential district  purposes specifically the gateway zoning district will attempt to a promote development and redevelopment consistent with the visioning plan for the gateway area by encouraging residential uses in conjunction with commercial and expanded recreational activities which in turn will create an active street life while enhancing the vitality of businesses and reducing vehicular traffic b provide for mixeduse developments that are carefully planned to promote efficient use of land parking and roadway systems c provide enhanced oversight use permit provisions to ensure compatibility of mixed uses and consistency with the approved master plan for the site d ensure compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods e provide significant incentives to promote mixeduse redevelopment projects f encourage sustainable architectural engineering and landscape design that is implemented by responsive green construction practices g preserve natural resources minimize the carbon footprint of the city and establish a key zone within gem lake that is respectful of neighboring areas and is instructive for future generations h encourage pedestrian and bicycle use i ensure that commercial and residential uses in a development are designed to be compatible with each other j ensure high standards of site design spatial relationships architectural design building materials and landscape design k seek to put in place those areas identified in the comprehensive plan as supported by the master plan that includes four subzones 1 neighborhood edge intended for lower density singlefamily residential housing development to act as a transition between new mixeduse construction and existing singlefamily detached structures on adjacent lands this subzone in its basic form will accommodate singlefamily dwellings on larger lots or with application of incentives more compact homes on common larger lots or on compact lots with enhanced buffers used in clustering shared with accessory buildings and generally served from a front or side driveway 2 neighborhood general intended to begin the transition from purely residential use at low densities to more intensive mixeduse development at the districts center this subzone will accommodate a variety of residential structures at varying densities and also begin to integrate lowerimpact office or retail activities which complement the residential setting 3 neighborhood mixed use intended to establish a neighborhood focus that is distinguished by mixed use buildings together with denser residential options and smallerscale commercial and office buildings without residential components this subzone will accommodate a variety of activities and services within easy walking distance from homes throughout the district supporting daily convenience shopping and personal service needs and also providing opportunities for public gathering and social contact 4 neighborhood center intended for the most urban conditions within all of the shown mixed use areas the mixture of land uses emphasizes groundfloor retail with offices and residentialrental above as market acceptance matures and structures providing commercial space for medium and largesized retailers street frontages throughout this subzone should be pedestrianoriented and the public space should be defined by placing building facades at the edge of the sidewalk neighborhood center land that abuts other subzones on the north and west sides will be carefully planned to ensure lowerdensity buildings  definitions specific to this terms

________________ 2009 city of gem lake ramsey county minnesota ordinance no 122 an ordinance amending the zoning ordinance of gem lake to add a new for a garden overlay zone the city council of the city of gem lake ordains amendment a new of is added to read as follows garden overlay district findings and purpose  the city council makes the following findings a the landuse plans of the city of gem lake historically have not assigned any land in the city for longterm agricultural use as the city has developed and continues to develop as a primarily residential community surrounded by fully developed suburban neighborhoods the city council reaffirms the citys intent to encourage development of the city in accordance with its adopted comprehensive plans b at the time this considered large land parcels in the city have yet to develop any primary use and stand vacant additional largelot property in the city is projected to subdivide and develop into smaller lots over the next 10 to 30 years the city council recognizes that economic conditions are not always favorable for real estate development and that the costs to carry vacant land can create pressures that promote suboptimal development permitting smallscale agriculture as a primary use will allow owners of large undeveloped parcels to qualify for agricultural tax classification and thus lower tax payments without affecting the longterm plans for the land the council finds that providing this means to temporarily ease this pressure will enhance the citys ability to fully realize the goals of its comprehensive plans c several cities and metropolitan areas are placing a greater emphasis on local food production as a means of improving public health allowing the use of available space in the city for community gardens or market gardens to grow food will promote local food production and improve public health in gem lake and the surrounding community d as an interim use of land subject to the regulations proposed community gardening and market gardening will be compatible with all allowed land uses in the city of gem lake and with the goals of the citys comprehensive plan  the council intends that the garden overlay district be available to overlay on parcels of land in any existing zoning district to add the uses described in the district regulations to the list of uses allowed upon that land the garden overlay district may be applied to and superimposed as an overlay upon any zoning district defined in this zoning as existing or amended by this section and as shown on the official zoning map nothing in this intended to affect the ability of landowners to maintain accessory uses that are allowed without the overlay zone upon their property whether or not the overlay zone covers their property this overlay district is intended to permit a temporary land use and should no longer be needed on a parcel when it eventually develops in accordance with the regulations of the underlying zoning district definitions community garden means an area of land managed and maintained by a group of individuals to grow plants and harvest food crops for personal or group use

property associated with hoffman corner and points westward along ramsey county road e extending northward to the border with the zoning districts identified in of this area has been the subject of a visioning study and includes both commercial and residential opportunities as described in the city of gem lake comprehensive plan and other city documents as introduced by the visioning plan and envisioned by the comprehensive plan the gateway will emphasize commercial development andor redevelopment in the hoffman corner intersection which traditionally has been the location of the gem lake commercial district as one moves westward along county road e the intent of the gateway is to transition into more residential type neighborhoods becoming less dense until it transitions to either the estate residential district or the executive residential district  rposes specifically the gateway zoning district will attempt to a promote development and redevelopment consistent with the visioning plan for the gateway area by encouraging residential uses in conjunction with commercial and expanded recreational activities which in turn will create an active street life while enhancing the vitality of businesses and reducing vehicular traffic b provide for mixeduse developments that are carefully planned to promote efficient use of land parking and roadway systems c provide enhanced oversight use permit provisions to ensure compatibility of mixed uses and consistency with the approved master plan for the site d ensure compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods e provide significant incentives to promote mixeduse redevelopment projects f encourage sustainable architectural engineering and landscape design that is implemented by responsive green construction practices g preserve natural resources minimize the carbon footprint of the city and establish a key zone within gem lake that is respectful of neighboring areas and is instructive for future generations h encourage pedestrian and bicycle use i ensure that commercial and residential uses in a development are designed to be compatible with each other j ensure high standards of site design spatial relationships architectural design building materials and landscape design k seek to put in place those areas identified in the comprehensive plan as supported by the master plan that includes four subzones 1 neighborhood edge intended for lower density singlefamily residential housing development to act as a transition between new mixeduse construction and existing singlefamily detached structures on adjacent lands this subzone in its basic form will accommodate singlefamily dwellings on larger lots or with application of incentives more compact homes on common larger lots or on compact lots with enhanced buffers used in clustering shared with accessory buildings and generally served from a front or side driveway 2 neighborhood general intended to begin the transition from purely residential use at low densities to more intensive mixeduse development at the districts center this subzone will accommodate a variety of residential structures at varying densities and also begin to integrate lowerimpact office or retail activities which complement the residential setting 3 neighborhood mixed use intended to establish a neighborhood focus that is distinguished by mixed use buildings together with denser residential options and smallerscale commercial and office buildings without residential components this subzone will accommodate a variety of activities and services within easy walking distance from homes throughout the district supporting daily convenience shopping and personal service needs and also providing opportunities for public gathering and social contact 4 neighborhood center intended for the most urban conditions within all of the shown mixed use areas the mixture of land uses emphasizes groundfloor retail with offices and residentialrental above as market acceptance matures and structures providing commercial space for medium and largesized retailers street frontages throughout this subzone should be pedestrianoriented

district findings and purpose  the city council makes the following findings a the landuse plans of the city of gem lake historically have not assigned any land in the city for longterm agricultural use as the city has developed and continues to develop as a primarily residential community surrounded by fully developed suburban neighborhoods the city council reaffirms the citys intent to encourage development of the city in accordance with its adopted comprehensive plans b at the time this considered large land parcels in the city have yet to develop any primary use and stand vacant additional largelot property in the city is projected to subdivide and develop into smaller lots over the next 10 to 30 years the city council recognizes that economic conditions are not always favorable for real estate development and that the costs to carry vacant land can create pressures that promote suboptimal development permitting smallscale agriculture as a primary use will allow owners of large undeveloped parcels to qualify for agricultural tax classification and thus lower tax payments without affecting the longterm plans for the land the council finds that providing this means to temporarily ease this pressure will enhance the citys ability to fully realize the goals of its comprehensive plans c several cities and metropolitan areas are placing a greater emphasis on local food production as a means of improving public health allowing the use of available space in the city for community gardens or market gardens to grow food will promote local food production and improve public health in gem lake and the surrounding community d as an interim use of land subject to the regulations proposed community gardening and market gardening will be compatible with all allowed land uses in the city of gem lake and with the goals of the citys comprehensive plan  the council intends that the garden overlay district be available to overlay on parcels of land in any existing zoning district to add the uses described in the district regulations to the list of uses allowed upon that land the garden overlay district may be applied to and superimposed as an overlay upon any zoning district defined in this zoning as existing or amended by this section and as shown on the official zoning map nothing in this intended to affect the ability of landowners to maintain

allow for development and redevelopment of the real property associated with hoffman corner and points westward along ramsey county road e extending northward to the border with the zoning districts identified in of this area has been the subject of a visioning study and includes both commercial and residential opportunities as described in the city of gem lake comprehensive plan and other city documents as introduced by the visioning plan and envisioned by the comprehensive plan the gateway will emphasize commercial development andor redevelopment in the hoffman corner intersection which traditionally has been the location of the gem lake commercial district as one moves westward along county road e the intent of the gateway is to transition into more residential type neighborhoods becoming less dense until it transitions to either the estate residential district or the executive residential district it may be permissible to apply to rezone the neighborhood edge subzone of the g district to existing traditional zoning re rx rs ro provided all setbacks and area requirements of said sections are met any such rezoning may preclude the use of planned unit development as an option  purposes specifically the gateway zoning district will attempt to a promote development and redevelopment consistent with the visioning plan for the gateway area by encouraging residential uses in conjunction with commercial and expanded recreational activities which in turn will create an active street life while enhancing the vitality of businesses and reducing vehicular traffic b provide for mixeduse developments that are carefully planned to promote efficient use of land parking and roadway systems c provide enhanced oversight use permit provisions to ensure compatibility of mixed uses and consistency with the approved master plan for the site d ensure compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods e provide significant incentives to promote mixeduse redevelopment projects f encourage sustainable architectural engineering and landscape design that is implemented by responsive green construction practices g preserve natural resources minimize the carbon footprint of the city and establish a key zone within gem lake that is respectful of neighboring areas and is instructive for future generations h encourage pedestrian and bicycle use i ensure that commercial and residential uses in a development are designed to be compatible with each other j ensure high standards of site design spatial relationships architectural design building materials and landscape design k seek to put in place those areas identified in the comprehensive plan as supported by the master plan that includes four subzones 1 neighborhood edge intended for lower density singlefamily residential housing development to act as a transition between new mixeduse construction and existing singlefamily detached structures on adjacent lands this subzone in its basic form will accommodate singlefamily dwellings on larger lots or with application of incentives more compact homes on common larger lots or on compact lots with enhanced buffers used in clustering shared with accessory buildings and generally served from a front or side driveway this subzone may be used to accommodate the development of public open spaces as identified in of this  131 gem lake consolidated land use  2 neighborhood general intended to begin the transition from purely residential use at low densities to more intensive mixeduse development at the districts center this subzone will accommodate a variety of residential structures at varying densities and also begin to integrate lowerimpact office or retail activities which complement the residential setting 3 neighborhood mixed use intended to establish a neighborhood focus that is distinguished by mixed use buildings together with denser residential options and smallerscale commercial and office buildings without residential components this subzone will accommodate a variety of activities and services within easy walking distance from homes throughout the district supporting daily convenience shopping and personal service needs and also providing opportunities for public gathering and social contact 4 neighborhood center intended for the most urban conditions within all of the shown mixed use areas the mixture of land uses emphasizes groundfloor retail with offices and residentialrental above as market acceptance matures and structures providing commercial space for medium and largesized retailers street frontages throughout this subzone should be pedestrianoriented and the public space should be defined by placing building facades at the edge of the sidewalk neighborhood center land that abuts other subzones

the following findings a the landuse plans of the city of gem lake historically have not assigned any land in the city for longterm agricultural use as the city has developed and continues to develop as a primarily residential community surrounded by fully developed suburban neighborhoods the city council reaffirms the citys intent to encourage development of the city in accordance with its adopted comprehensive plans b at the time this considered large land parcels in the city have yet to develop any primary use and stand vacant additional largelot property in the city is projected to subdivide and develop into smaller lots over the next 10 to 30 years the city council recognizes that economic conditions are not always favorable for real estate development and that the costs to carry vacant land can create pressures that promote suboptimal development permitting smallscale agriculture as a primary use will allow owners of large undeveloped parcels to qualify for agricultural tax classification and thus lower tax payments without affecting the longterm plans for the land the council finds that providing this means to temporarily ease this pressure will enhance the citys ability to fully realize the goals of its comprehensive plans c several cities and metropolitan areas are placing a greater emphasis on local food production as a means of improving public health allowing the use of available space in the city for community gardens or market gardens to grow food will promote local food production and improve public health in gem lake and the surrounding
