sign regulations signs are a vital part of miami township as sources of information and as components in the landscape they contribute to the health safety and general welfare of the community by giving general information location direction and warning a purpose it is the intent of miami township to have uniform sign standards for the following purposes 1 to protect the right of free speech as guaranteed by the constitution of the united states of america by permitting noncommercial signs on any property 2 to regulate the time place and manner of signage in order to protect the public health safety convenience comfort prosperity and general welfare by a permitting a variety of noncommercial and commercial signage within miami township b prohibiting signs that cause a hazard to the public due to  but not limited to the setback illumination or movement of a signs message c protecting public safety by requiring the removal or repair of damaged signs d limiting visual clutter in order to promote a healthier business and community atmosphere property values by regulating the height quantity and placement of signs e promoting the visibility of adjacent properties and streetscape aesthetics by regulating the height area quantity movement and landscaping of signage f establishing conditions under which nonconforming signage must be brought into conformity b findings in adopting these regulations the miami township board of trustees finds that 1 miami township originally enacted sign regulations as part of the enactment of the zoning resolution effective   and 2 miami township has not been a defendant in litigation concerning the sign regulations since their enactment  and 3 these regulations will further miami townships desire to have sign regulations that will fulfill the purpose and intent stated in these regulations and abide by miami township zoning resolution article 41  sign regulations revised december 2011  res 1682011 41  2 constitutional guarantees concerning free speech and freedom of expression  and 4 miami township has retained the firm of surdyk dowd and turner co lpa to oversee the development of these sign regulations and said firm has expert experience in developing sign regulations based upon protecting constitutional guarantees of free speech and freedom of expression  and 5 a growing number of noncommercial and commercial freestanding monument signs are abiding by the terms of these regulations and provisions seeking the removal and replacement of nonconforming signs with conforming signs have been enforced since the original enactment of these regulations miami township has a declining number of nonconforming roof signs pylon signs and wall signs  and 6 greater flexibility is needed in the provision of wall signs and other types of signage within the various noncommercial and commercial areas of the township  and 7 there is a continued need to have a consistent system of sign standards to ensure the continued safety and attractiveness of noncommercial and commercial areas and to provide a fair and consistent method of sign allowances in order to protect property values and protect the general public welfare  and 8 establishing specific setback and height standards will promote public safety and general welfare by allowing for future rightofway and roadway expansions and restricting signage that will block site visibility for those entering or leaving a property  and 9 establishing height and area standards will promote uniform sign design reduce the instances of larger signs visually blocking signs or buildings on adjacent properties reduce the visual clutter of multiple pylon signs at varying heights and sizes and permit certain larger signs to accommodate multiple tenants on a single sign in order to consolidate signage  and 10 there is a continued need for standards for the area of signage on buildings in order to provide signage to users in a proportional and consistent manner based upon the size of the wall upon which such signs are to be placed  and 11 establishing certain landscaping and architectural standards will promote a uniform appearance for the majority of free standing signage to be utilized  and 12 there is a need for a variety of structural and functional signs to provide information to persons on or off a property  and 13 there is a need to maintain appropriate standards for placing address miami township zoning resolution article 41  sign regulations revised december 2011  res 1682011 41  3 information on buildings in order to protect the public
