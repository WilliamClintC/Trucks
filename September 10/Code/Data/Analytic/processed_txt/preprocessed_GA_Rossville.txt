maintain and enhance the public health safety and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure safeguard the general health safety and welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources this article seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 encourage decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that reflect the integrity of the watershed and preserving the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment in their postdevelopment state maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed and pose no threat to public safety  7 establish administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved projects  5806 applicability this article shall be applicable to all land development including but not limited to site plan applications subdivision applications and grading applications unless eligible for an exemption from this article the article also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria even though multiple separate and
