local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council of the city of pearland texas does ordain as follows  1exh a 121916 22  findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  1exh a 121916 23  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 8 regulate all fill in the floodplain to ensure that all placed in the floodplain is mitigated by compensating cut material that is removed from the floodplain so that no increase of flood levels well result  1exh a 121916 24  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 ensure that all fill in the floodplain is mitigated by compensating cut in the floodplain  1exh a 121916 secs 10125101219

district that is consistent with the recommendations within the citys adopted 2004 comprehensive plan update the spectrum district is comprised of five 5 subdistricts that provide areas for these different land uses in a compatible manner the requirements for development within each district are contained herein the subdistricts are as follows 1 district s1 the beltway district the s1 subdistrict is intended for nonresidential development that typically desires high visibility from major thoroughfares retail uses such as shops and restaurants should be the primary uses within this subdistrict a malllike setting either indoor or outdoor would be ideal for these locations pedestrian circulation should be a prime consideration in addition science and technology related office uses also referred to as techflex andor class a office uses developed within a business park or corporate campus would also be appropriate in addition development should respect natural features such as creeks and drainage ways by integrating such features into the overall design of the sites 2 district s2 the mixed use district the s2 subdistrict is appropriate for a variety of land uses including hotels a conference centerconvention center tourismoriented uses commercial light industrial and science and technology related uses this wide variety of acceptable uses is intended to allow for optimum market flexibility for development within the s2 area any commercial andor light industrial uses developed should be within a business park or corporate campus with buildings and parking situated such that a feeling of open space is created and business activities should take place wholly within buildings development should also respect natural features such as creeks and drainage ways by integrating such features into the overall design of the zoning regulations 54 sites walkability and pedestrianorientation is important for this site due to its central location within the overall spectrum district 3 district s3 the mixed usehigh density residential district the s3 sub district is intended for traditional neighborhood design tnd which is characterized by a vertical mix of nonresidential and residential uses with retail andor office uses on the ground floor and residential uses above in addition consistent with other areas of the spectrum district commercial and light industrial science and technology related uses developed within a business park or corporate campus would also be appropriate within the s3 area compatibility with residential uses should be an important design consideration 4 district s4 the light industrial and science & technology district the s4 subdistrict is intended for light industrial uses that may have some business activity that takes place outside andor some outside storage of materials to maintain the quality of the spectrum district however such outside activity andor storage should be screened the s4 subdistrict should provide positive transition between development within the s5 subdistrict discussed below and the s2 subdistrict design guidelines should ensure that businesses provide an aesthetically pleasing view from the planned roadways 5 district s5 the light & heavy industrial district the s5 subdistrict is intended for light or heavy industrial development that may have outside business activity and outside storage much of the development to the south and west of the spectrum district area is characterized by heavy commercial and industrial businesses and the s5 subdistrict should provide transition between these existing uses and the development within the s4 subdistrict design guidelines should be established to ensure that future development provides an aesthetically pleasing view

nonconforming status and no nonconforming use is expanded into the structure 5 in granting special exceptions under this the zba shall avoid doing so merely to allow a convenience or convey an advantage to the applicant but instead shall endeavor to reduce the nonconforming nature of the nonconforming use whenever possible and so may impose such criteria as are necessary to bring the

reduce the parking and loading requirements in an amount not exceeding thirtythree percent 33% of the normal requirement in any of the districts whenever the character or use of the building makes

are under the same ownership  or b it can be established that two or more uses applying jointly and concurrently for the special exception will be sharing a parking area that may be on property that is not under the same ownership as one or more of the uses to be served by the parking where the shared parking area has a capacity of at least the minimum number of spaces for the use having the greatest minimum requirement where all uses have their primary need for parking during offsetting periods so that the parking area will be utilized by only one principal use at a time and where the arrangement is documented longterm lease or other written agreement 4 to allow the reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been damaged to the extent of more than fifty percent 50% of its
