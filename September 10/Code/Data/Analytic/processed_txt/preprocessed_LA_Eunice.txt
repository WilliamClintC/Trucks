those whose repeal was specifically exempted in the adopting relating to special purposes or having a limited life such as enactments levying taxes or special assessments providing for bond issues vacating specified streets etc were not included an enumeration of the types of ordinances which were not included and are therefore not affected is set forth in of the adopting addition to local legislation certain selfoperative provisions of the louisiana revised statutes and other state legislative material adopted by the city by reference were also included where such material added to the city laws on a particular subject or was needed to clarify an issue one of the main directives that the mayor and board of aldermen gave to the staff engaged in this project was that it develop a publication that was not only factually correct and up to date but also one that could be conveniently used by those trained in the law and lay persons as well in responding to that directive several things were done first all of the minutes of the citys governing body were researched back to the time of the citys incorporation material gathered from the records was then checked against state laws court decisions and opinions of the louisiana attorney general for agreement and compliance in some instances new ordinances were adopted before the finally enacted to bring the citys laws into compliance with state authority relating to the matter the material was then divided into subject matter groupings and those groupings were developed into chapters the chapters were further divided into subchapters parts and sections in a manner intended to provide a logical sequence of provisions each chapter subchapter and section was then appropriately titled or provided with a heading to facilitate easy reference and identification of the subject matter contained therein following each section in parentheses is a note indicating the legislative source of the material therein contained the source notes for the local legislation indicate the date the legislation was adopted the section number within the legislation if section numbers were employed and a brief historical note explaining if the original enactment had ever been amended source notes which contain an lrs number mean that the material in that section was derived from the louisiana revised statutes the numbers that follow the lrs designation indicate the title and section from which the material was obtained many chapter and subchapter titles and sections are also followed by a comment note these notes were employed by the staff to cross reference sections of the code which related to one another to refer the reader to the general source of authority by which the city had the power to enact such a provision and to otherwise add or provide information to the reader on a particular matter these notes were especially prepared to save the user valuable time and effort in researching various provisions of the citys laws and to aid in construction and interpretation the numbering system used in this similar to that followed in the louisiana revised statutes each section number consists of the two parts separated by a colon the first part of the number refers to the chapter in which the material is located and the second part to the specific location of the material in the chapter thus the first section in is numbered the third section in is numbered the system was devised to enable the reader to more easily cite material andor locate material so cited the reader will also notice that occasionally the editors have reserved certain section numbers within chapters and always between subchapters this was done to facilitate the inclusion of new material as such material is enacted in the future page numbers following subchapters and chapters have also been reserved for the same reason the contains a comprehensively developed word index most of the provisions in the been listed under several different headings in the index to make the location of material as easy as possible the attention of the reader is also called to the special looseleaf format of this publication this format was employed also to facilitate the inclusion and addition of new legislative material municipal governments are not static creatures and from time to time new ordinances will need to be adopted and existing laws will need to be changed as new legislation is enacted supplements will be prepared and made available containing the new material holders of the therefore urged to check with city officials from time to time concerning the availability of such supplements finally the mayor and board of aldermen would like to take this opportunity to express its appreciation to mr wesley h

reserved designation of congested areas the following named and described areas streets or portions of streets and such other areas street or portions of streets as may hereafter be included in this

side of third street both sides 3 park avenue north side only from a point one hundred four 104 feet east of the west side of second street west to east side of third street 4 vine avenue south side only from its intersection with east side of second street to its intersection with west side of public alley  8249     comment the various amending ordinances revised the boundaries of the congested areas the preamble to set out the purpose of the regulations established therein as follows whereas the volume of traffic on the streets in certain sections of the town of eunice louisiana has the effect of congesting the streets and impeding the movement of traffic and whereas the numerous operators of motor vehicles park on the streets of eunice in the congested areas for unreasonably long periods of time too near to other parked vehicles so parked on the most congested parts of the towns busiest streets and whereas such practices retard orderly and even shopping intervals impede traffic and constitute a danger to persons and property of motorists and pedestrians and whereas the mayor and board of aldermen of the town of eunice louisiana are agreed that the best method by which these conditions may be remedied is by the designation of individual parking spaces in the area so congested by restricting parking in said areas to reasonable intervals of time and by the compelling of operators of vehicles who use the parking space so designated to pay a portion of the cost of establishing and maintaining the same and whereas attempts to regulate traffic and parking in the congested areas have proved not as successful as desirable for the reason that adequate policing of this problem by the police department alone requires a larger number of officers for such work than can be spared from other necessary functions of the police department now therefore be it ordained congested area regulationsdefinitions a where employed in these congested area regulations

or addition to the hence is included herein as   at the discretion of the editor secs   reserved repair of natural gas lines on private property  notice to owner  failure to respond wherever the private natural gas line of a customer or owner is discovered or found to be in disrepair resulting in leaks loss of gas and possible attendant danger to life and property the city shall inform the customer or owner of such leaks and notify owner or customer to repair such in fifteen 15 days and if such private line of the customer or owner is not so repaired the city will discontinue service and shall not renew service until such repair or installation has been made tested and found to be leak free  comment as an explanation for the need the abovecited ordinance was prefaced with the following provisions whereas there are many customers or consumers whose gas meters within the city limits of the city of eunice which for a number of obvious reasons are located at the dwelling or at a point where the customers line enters a place or building where the gas is to be used or consumed  and whereas the private line of a consumer or owner from the citys supply line to the meter is often in a state of serious disrepair which results in a loss of much gas to the city of eunice which is uncompensated for and which may result in danger of accident  and whereas the city has no right to enter upon the private property and excavate and repair the line of a consumer or owner and it is of course not the obligation of the city to do so  and whereas in order to eliminate such loss and any related danger the city has elected to notify the consumer or owner as herein provided for where such disrepair and danger is discovered to give the customer fifteen 15 days written notice in which to renew or repair the customers line to a state that it will be loss free and in the event the consumers or owners failure to do so the city will discontinue service now therefore be it ordained repair of natural gas lines outside of corporate limits  location of meters  allocation of costs a the city of eunice having recently completed a study of its gas distribution system beyond the city limits shall replace or extensively repair gas line or lines belonging to the city and located beyond the city limits and will make certain replacements or extensive repairs to certain line or lines to comply with the findings and recommendations of the experts employed by city to conduct such survey or surveys b on such outside of corporate limits lines or meters shall be moved andor installed on the main line belonging to city at the point where the service lines of a customer joint to the main line insofar as possible c an accurate accounting of the cost of installation and operation of the line shall be maintained to the end that the expense for the installation of any such lines or extensive repairs shall be employed in the regulation of price or prices of the gas to the customers and such adjustment shall be that necessary to reimburse the city for such expenditure or expenditures within that period for installation or repair  d the necessary and proper devices and check meters shall be installed and maintained so as to be accurate throughout the period from installation to and   comment the abovecited ordinance contained the following preface explaining the need for its adoption whereas the city of eunice for some 40 years has owned and operated its own natural gas utility system which includes the ownership of pipelines and the distribution of natural gas to its customers  and whereas as authorized and permitted by law the system lies both within the corporate limits and without the corporate limits  and whereas some portion or portions of the lines lying outside of and beyond the corporate limits of the city of eunice are deteriorating and the installation of new lines or repairs must be made on such lines lying beyond the city limits as the city is experiencing the loss of much gas and consequent revenues  and whereas such operation is not sound financial practice and is not a conservation of our energy natural resource  and whereas the contract whereby the city of eunice acquires its natural gas needs and requirements in order to serve its customers expires in december of 197 and it would not be sound business practice nor responsible fiscal management on the part of the mayor and board of aldermen of the city of eunice to expend sums in the relaying of new lines the cost of which would not be paid for or liquidated during the remaining twoyear period for the contract  and whereas there are consumers upon a line or lines owned by the city of eunice and which lie beyond its corporate limits whose meters or gasmeasuring devices are not located at the citys main service lines but are some distance away and leaks in the private line of the consumer are resulting in financial loss to the city of eunice and good business practice renders it imperative that services be discontinued until the meters are moved and installed to the gas mains belonging to the city of eunice  and whereas the foregoing being true the city must discontinue service make major repairs or install the new lines and increase rates to the end that the expenditures needed in the installation of the new lines will pay out for the installation and operating cost within the life of its present gas purchase contract which expires in december 1979 now therefore be it ordained placement and location of meters a all service meters or master meters used or employed by the city in the operation of its natural gas system shall be located at the citys main or supply line at the most reasonable point of access for both city and customer b if within ten 10 days after the city has called upon the customer to permit entry for the purpose of locating or relocating meters in accordance with the provisions of this section and according to safety standards in the industry customer refuses such entry then the city shall have the right and privilege to discontinue service to such customer  2 73178 changing and maintenance of

the city may make installation of the meter and other like necessary installations upon public property abutting private property in which case the city will upon request of the property owner or consumer furnish the necessary service line pipe which property owner will himself install under the supervision of the city and the city before supplying service will test the line in this case the city may go upon the property for the purpose of repairing the line c should the property owner refuse to grant rightofway including the necessary trench and installation essential to service or should the property owner refuse to make installation of plastic line or its equivalent upon his property the city may refuse natural gas service or the city may move or locate the meter regulator and other necessary apparatus to the property line common to private ownership and public ownership and furnish service but not until the consumer or property owner as the case may be executes an instrument of release exempting the city from all liability for any injury to himself his family invitees or guests on his properties that may occur upon the property as a result of the furnishing of
