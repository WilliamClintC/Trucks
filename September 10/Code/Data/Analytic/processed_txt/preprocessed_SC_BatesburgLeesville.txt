opening but prior to award when the procurement officers determines in writing that 1 inadequate or ambiguous specifications were cited in the invitation  2 specifications have been revised  3 the supplies or services being procured are no longer required  4 the invitation did not provide for consideration of all factors of costs to the town such as cost of transporting townfurnished property to bidders plants  5 bids received indicate that the needs of the town can be satisfied by a less expensive article differing from that on which the bids were invited  6 all otherwise acceptable bids received are at unreasonable prices  7 the bids were not independently arrived at in open competition were collusive or were submitted in bad faith  or 8 for other reasons cancellation is clearly in the best interest of the town determinations to cancel invitations for bids shall state the reasons therefor c extension of bid acceptance period  should administrative difficulties be encountered after bid opening which may delay award beyond bidders acceptance periods the several lowest bidders should be requested before expiration of their bids to extend the bid acceptance period with consent of sureties if any in order to avoid the need for readvertisement  rejection of individual bids a general application  any bid which fails to conform to the essential requirements of the invitation for bids shall be rejected b alternate bids  any bid which does not conform to the specifications contained or referenced in the invitation for bids may be reflected unless the invitation authorized the submission of alternate bids and the supplies offered as alternates meet the requirements specified in the invitation c nonresponsive bids  any bid which fails to conform to the delivery schedule or permissible alternates thereto stated in the invitation for bids may be rejected as nonresponsive d modification of requirements by bidder  ordinarily a bid should be rejected when the bidder attempts to impose conditions which would modify requirements of the invitation for bids or limit his liability to the town since to allow the bidder to impose such conditions would be prejudicial to other bidders for example bids should be rejected in which the bidder 1 attempts to protect himself against future changes in conditions such as increased costs if total possible cost to the town cannot be determined  2 fails to state a price and in lieu thereof states that price shall be price in effect at same time of delivery  3 states a price but qualified such price as being subject to price in effect at same time of delivery  4 when not authorized by the invitation conditions or qualifies his bid by stipulating that his bid is to be considered only if prior to date of award bidder received or does not receive award under a separate procurement  5 requires the town to determine that the bidders product meets town specifications  or 6 limits the rights of the town under any contract clause the lowest responsive and responsible bidder may be requested to delete objectionable conditions from his bid provided that these conditions do not go to the substance as distinguished from the form of the bid or work an injustice on other bidders e price unreasonableness  any bid may be rejected if the procurement officer determines in writing that it is unreasonable as to price f bid guarantee requirement  when a bid guarantee is required and a bidder fails to furnish it in accordance with the requirements of the invitation for bids the bid shall be rejected g

that the time set for bid opening has arrived shall be rejected  allornone qualifications unless the invitation for bids so provides a bid is not rendered nonresponsive by the fact that the bidder specifies that award will be accepted only on all or a specified group of the items included in the invitation for bids however bidders shall not be permitted to withdraw or modify allornone qualifications after bid opening since such qualification is substantive and affects the rights of the other bidders  minor informalities and irregularities in bids a minor informality or irregularity is one which is merely a matter of form or is some immaterial variation from the exact requirements of the invitation for bids having to effect or merely a trivial or negligible effect on price quality quantity or delivery of the supplies or performance of the services being procured and the correction or waiver of which would not affect the relative standing of or be otherwise prejudicial to bidders the procurement officer shall either give the bidder an opportunity to cure any deficiency resulting from a minor informality or irregularity in a bid or waive any such deficiency where it is to the advantage of the town such communication or determination shall be in writing examples of minor informalities or irregularities include but are not limited to 1 failure of bidder to return the number of copies of signed bids required by the invitation 2 failure to furnish the required information concerning the number of the bidders employees or failure to make a representation concerning his status 3 failure of a bidder to sign his bid but only if a the firm submitting the bid has formally adopted or authorized the execution of documents by typewritten printed or rubber stamped signature and submits evidence of such authorization and the bid carries such a signature  or b the unsigned bid is accompanied by other material indicating the bidders intention to be bound by the unsigned bid document such as the submissions of a bid guarantee with the bid or a letter signed by the bidder with the bid referring to and clearly identifying the bid itself 4 failure of a bidder to acknowledge receipt of an amendment to an invitation for bids but only if a the bid received clearly indicates that the bidder received the amendment such as where the amendment added another item to the invitation for bids and the bidder submitted a bid thereon  b the amendment clearly would have no effect or merely a trivial or negligible effect on price quantity delivery or the relative standing of bidders such as an amendment correcting a typographical mistake in the name of the governmental body  c there is a failure to furnish an affidavit concerning affiliates if required  or d there is a failure to execute the certifications with respect to equal opportunity and affirmative action programs  correction or withdrawal of bids  cancellation of awards a general procedure  a bidder or offeror must submit in writing a request to either correct or withdraw a bid to the procurement officer each written request must document the fact that the bidders or offerors mistake is clearly an error that will cause him substantial loss b correction creates low bid  to maintain the integrity of the competitive sealed bidding system a bidder shall not be permitted to correct a bid mistake after bid opening that would cause such bidder to have the low bid unless the mistake in the judgment of the procurement officers is clearly evident from examining the bid document  for example extension of unit prices or errors in addition  award a application  the contract shall be awarded to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids b time of award  the contract award shall be made within 30 days from the bid opening unless the procurement officer shall determine that

home park development regardless of classification eg arterial collector minor street must be a minimum of 20 feet pavement width i traffic generation standards for minor streets if development is permitted to overload and exceed the design capacity of streets they cannot properly function as designed and built overloaded streets detract from accessibility to any existing commercial or residential development and increase the risk of accidents therefore developments which are expected to generate traffic volumes in excess of 500 passenger cars per day and taking primary access form a minor street will be evaluated by the town planning staff the staff will use techniques described in the current highway capacity manual the national cooperative highway research program report no

requirements for placement installation and maintenance of business and advertising signs in order to preserve and protect the health safety welfare and general wellbeing of the communitys citizens as regulation of placement construction and maintenance of buildings and structures is a valid use of the police power so too is regulation of placement installation and maintenance of signs since such signs in the literal sense must ordinarily be considered structures and in a practical sense are capable of producing many of the same nuisances as are produced by buildings regulation of placement installation and maintenance of signs is further justified by their purpose which is to draw mental attention to them potentially to the detriment of sound driving practices and to the safety of the motoring public to which a majority of signs are oriented therefore it is the intent of the  to regulate the size and location of business and advertising signs so that their purpose can be served without unduly interfering with motorists and causing unsafe conditions finally it is the objective of this  to protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community by regulating placement installation and maintenance of signs the fact that such signs are intended to command visual contact grants to business and advertising signs a proportionately greater role than other structures in determining the overall aesthetic quality of the community the aesthetic impact of business and advertising signs is an economic fact which may bear heavily upon the enjoyment and value of property  therefore the regulation of signs is validly justified on the basis of conserving the value of property and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the municipality it is contended that it is not irrational for a communitys citizens to plan their physical surroundings in such a way that unsightliness is minimized with this purpose in mind it is the intent of the  to authorize the use of business and advertising signs which are a compatible with their surroundings  b appropriate to the type of activity to which they pertain  c expressive of the identify of the individual proprietors or of the community as a whole  d large enough to convey a message about the owner or occupants of a particular property the products or services available on such property or the business activities conducted on such property yet small enough to preserve and protect the natural beauty of the town and limit distractions to motorists 92  definitions in addition to the definitions set forth in of this the following definitions relate to signs 921 display surface area that area of a sign including the entire area within a regular geometric shape or combination of regular geometric shapes enclosing all of the elements of informational or representational matter displayed including blank masking or any surface shape intended to convey ideas information or meaning frames or

significant generally any land with an average corn suitability rating csr of 65 or higher is considered prime agricultural land and therefore deemed to be agriculturally significant for the purpose of this article clustering a subdivision design method that concentrates development in specific areas on the proposed site the purpose of clustering is to allow increased density on a portion of the parcel while preserving the rest as permanent open space the density of the entire parcel will not exceed the original density of the parcel the houses will just be grouped together in one or more areas on the parcel unless a density bonus is granted by the planning commission which will allow increased building density on the parcel the concept of clustering provides for a flexibility in

welfare of the citizens of the town of batesburgleesville developers are encouraged to work with the planning commission to avoid delays in project approvals 102  artificial impoundments although aesthetically pleasing the creation of artificial lakes or impoundments can result in significant water quality problems and dam safety issues 1021 water quality 1 framework altering the natural flow of water can lead to eutrophication  a process by which a standing body of water becomes enriched with excess plant nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen which results in excess algal production this condition leads to lower dissolved oxygen do levels which can have a detrimental effect on fish species and water quality artificial impoundments also lead to higher water temperatures and excess sedimentation also harmful to aquatic species artificial lakes in the town of batesburgleesville should be planned carefully with a view towards ecological consequences 2 recommendation developers should take appropriate steps to maintain good water quality in artificial lakes developing a longterm strategy for maintaining water quality is recommended this strategy may include the use of greater setbacks for principal structures and associated buildings with impermeable surfaces from the normal high water mark of the water body vegetative buffers along the edge of the water body or the installation of an aeration system to maintain a healthy level of do in the water body 1022 dams 1 framework a dam breach can be a significant threat to the safety of homeowners and motorists in the event that a road is constructed on a dam for this reason all dams must meet either requirements of the south carolina department of dam safety the us corps of engineers or b2 of this ordinance whichever is applicable 2 requirements any dam construction not covered under the requirements of the south carolina department of dam safety and for the purpose of creating an artificial impoundment for the benefit of a residential subdivision including subdivisions not yet proposed shall conform with the following requirements a the developer must provide dam construction drawings and plans certified by a professional engineer to the planning commission prior to beginning any site work b upon concurrence by the planning commission and the town engineer that the proposed dam construction will not cause unreasonable harm to the health safety and general welfare of the residents of the town the developer may proceed with construction c dam construction shall be periodically inspected by the developers engineer to ensure conformance with the approved drawings and plans the developer shall be responsible for notifying the planning commission and the town engineer during a minimum of three 3 phases of dam construction see below the town engineer may inspect the construction at their discretion phase 1  coring backfilling and setting of invert phase 2  midconstruction of fill phase 3  top fill and grading d dams existing prior to the adoption of this ordinance must meet the requirements of this ordinance before a road is constructed on the dam 103  reserved article 11  land surveying standards connecting surveys to state plane coordinate system purpose the purpose of this section is to require certain land parcels located within reasonable distance from monumented control points to be referenced by field survey to geodetic control points that are defined by state plane coordinates in cases where monumented control points are not within a reasonable distance as defined in this document the requirement will be to reference the survey to points which are identifiable on the county orthophoto maps property surveys affected by this section will be referenced to its accurate geographical locations and therefore can be plotted in their correct position on the state plane coordinatebased county mapping system these positions can be reproduced to the same accuracy as the original determination even if all physically platted corners or supporting evidence or both have been destroyed this will improve greatly county land records by allowing ground surveys to be easily and accurately translated to county maps  hard copy or electronic in addition land owners will benefit in that property corners tied directly to monumented geodetic control by field surveys are defined by mathematical references which cannot be destroyed  therefore in the future missing or destroyed property corners can be more easily reestablished with a high level of confidence this concept has existed for many years but it has not been practical to apply on the county level until recent developments in technology allowed the costeffective production of accurate mapping systems and the placement of closely spaced geodetic control monuments defined by very accurate coordinates in addition the recent development of the satellite based global positioning system gps is revolutionizing control surveys surveys requiring tie to geodetic control monument the following surveys require ties to geodetic control monuments any subdivision of five 5 or more lots within a onemile traverse distance of geodetic control any tract of five 5 or more acres within a onemile traverse distance of geodetic control any subdivision of 25 or more lots or nonagricultural industrialcommercial development of 25 or more acres regardless of distance from geodetic control surveys exempt from geodetic control monument tie it is considered very desirable for surveyors to tie all surveys whenever possible to the state plane coordinate system nothing in these exemptions is intended to discourage surveyors from tying surveys to the state plane coordinate system the following surveys are exempted from geodetic control monument tie mortgage surveys of residential property in existing subdivisions any survey not specified in surveys requiring orthophoto locator tie with the
