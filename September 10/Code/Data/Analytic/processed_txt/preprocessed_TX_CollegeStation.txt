a the city council finds that the city has received numerous and continuous complaints from citizens about persons going onto residential premises including premises that contain conspicuous signs prohibiting solicitations to solicit sell or take orders for goods and services and to distribute commercial printed matter  and 1 those citizens have expressed concerns that such solicitations result in criminal activity including burglary and fraud and disturb the privacy of their homes  2 the city council believes that establishing a registration program for those home solicitors will protect the citizens against criminal activity including but not limited to burglary and fraud minimize the unwelcome disturbance of citizens and the disruption of their privacy and otherwise preserve the public health safety and welfare  3 the city council believes it is in the interest of the public health safety and welfare to prohibit persons convicted of certain crimes from being home solicitors in the city  4 the city council has considered the following criteria a the nature and seriousness of the crimes  b the relationship of the crimes to the purposes for requiring a certificate of registration to engage in the occupation  c the extent to which a certificate of registration might offer an opportunity to engage in further criminal activity of the same type as that in which the person previously has been involved  and d the relationship of the crimes to the ability capacity or fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the registered occupation  and has determined that the crimes listed in a2 are serious crimes which directly relate to the duties and responsibilities of a home solicitor whose job is to solicit sell and take orders for goods and services and to distribute commercial printed matter on residential premises in the city  5 the city council has determined that the very nature of the occupation of a home solicitor brings such a person into constant contact with the public which gives the person repeated opportunities to participate in crimes of violence or dishonesty or crimes against the public health safety or morals should the person be so inclined and thus it is the opinion of the city council that the crimes listed in a2 render a person unable incompetent and unfit to perform the duties and responsibilities of a home solicitor in a manner that would promote the public safety and trust  and 6 the city council has determined that no person who has been convicted of a crime as listed in a2 is presently fit to engage in home solicitation in the city until the respective time periods designated in that section have expired and thus should be disqualified from being issued a certificate of registration as a home solicitor until the expiration of those time periods b the city council finds that the regulations of this article do no prevent doortodoor activity and that ample alternative channels of communication exist outside of the time limitations including solicitation via telephone electronic communication public solicitation outside of the privacy of citizens doorsteps and solicitation via direct mail television radio and internet c the purpose of this article is to further the citys legitimate and compelling interest in securing city citizens general health safety and welfare by 1 prohibiting doortodoor home solicitation during times when such activity is most intrusive and disruptive to citizens privacy and the security of their homes  2 regulating the manner in which doortodoor solicitation activity may occur so as to protect citizens in the privacy of their own homes from aggressive and intimidating practices  and 3 requiring home solicitors to register

intended to inform the applicant of the citys expectations to ensure safe and adequate access to development properties  adequate traffic flow on existing and proposedplanned roadways  and sufficient connectivity of the existing and proposedplanned roadway system attributable to their proposal in addition this intended to expedite the citys review of tia reports provide standard criteria for evaluating proposals and identify some potential mitigation measures the tia is intended to form the basis for design of any proposed accessroadway system to ensure coordination of the proposed land use with the transportation needs resulting there from the city of college station and the developer share responsibility to identify and solve transportation issues arising from land development college station requires that tias accompany certain zoning applications certain site plan applications and certain preliminary plan applications it is intended that any tia required for any type of land development proposal will complement the overall goal of ensuring that adequate transportation facilities are in place to serve land uses by the time those uses are occupied and generating traffic these purposes are further amplified below a purpose  1 zoning tia  the goal of a tia submitted in conjunction with a zoning request is to determine the effect that uses allowed within various proposed zones will have on existing andor any proposedplanned roadway systems and to ensure there is a balance between future land uses and future transportation systems zoning applications that are required to have a tia are evaluated using both current and longterm traffic and roadway scenarios the tia will determine whether acceptable levels of service will be maintained for traffic flow within the proposed project and in its study area where service levels fall below acceptable standards mitigation solutions will be analyzed for their effectiveness a tia for a zoning request should not recommend mitigation measures that are inconsistent with any traffic or roadway provisions of the unified development the citys comprehensive plan including the thoroughfare plan the planning and zoning commission and the city council shall consider the findings of the tia in approving or disapproving zoning changes to the extent allowed by law 2 preliminary plan tia  the goal of a tia submitted in conjunction with a preliminary plan is twofold to assess the adequacy and safety of proposed access to adjacent existing or planned roadways or designs proposed for such access or roadways  and to determine effects the proposed project may have on current and future land development and roadway systems in its study area generally the tia uses current and anticipated nearterm traffic volumes and roadway configurations for the analysis the process should ensure that the roadway system is or will be adequate to accommodate the proposed use and that safe and adequate access will be provided for travel between the site and the public roadway system where the tia shows levels of service falling below acceptable minimums on roadway systems in its study area the tia will recommend appropriate mitigation measures and demonstrate their effectiveness example mitigation techniques may include addinglengthening decelerationturn lanes improving driveway access providing connectivity and modifying traffic control devices combinations of these techniques and other techniques can be considered a tia for a preliminary plan should not recommend mitigation measures that are inconsistent with any traffic or roadway provisions of the unified development the citys comprehensive plan including the thoroughfare plan the planning and zoning commission shall consider the findings of the tia in approving or disapproving preliminary plans to the extent allowed by law 3 site plan tia  the goal of a tia submitted in conjunction with a site plan is twofold to assess the

texas constitution and the statutes of the state of texas including but not by way of limitation texas local government as may be amended from time to time it is hereby declared by the city council that recreational areas in the form of neighborhood parks and community parks are necessary and in the public welfare and that the only adequate procedure to provide for neighborhood parks and community parks is by integrating such requirements into the procedure for planning and developing property or subdivisions in the city and its etj whether such development consists of new construction on vacant land or rebuilding and remodeling of structures on existing residential property neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities and located within convenient distances from a majority of the residences to be served thereby located within park zones established by the city the park zones established by the college station parks and recreation department and shown on the official parks and recreation map for the city of college station shall be prima facie proof that any park located therein is within such a convenient distance from any residence located therein the primary cost of purchasing developing or improving neighborhood parks should be borne by the landowners of residential property who by reason of the

in college station is designed to serve the needs of residents from several neighborhoods located within onehalf to threemile radius community parks provide amenities that should complement neighborhood parks together neighborhood parks and community parks can meet more of the recreational needs of residents community parks are generally twentyfive 25 to seventy 70 acres in size however larger and smaller community parks may be purchased developed andor improved to meet specific requirements of a particular area of town community parks by their nature serve both active and passive leisure needs of residents and use by organizations and individuals from surrounding areas larger than for neighborhood parks the acquisition development and improvement of the basic infrastructure and facilities for the usage of these community parks should be based upon the demand from the area residents it is intended to serve therefore the following requirements are adopted to affect the purposes stated above b applicability this to a landowner who develops land for residential use located within the city or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction c requirements 1 general the city manager or his designee shall administer this certain review recommendation and approval authorities being assigned to the planning and zoning commission the parks and recreation advisory board and
