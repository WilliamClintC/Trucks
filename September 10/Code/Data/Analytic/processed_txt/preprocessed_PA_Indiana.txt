neighborhood deterioration76 76editors note amended at time of adoption of see ch 1 general provisions art i  36067 indiana code  3651  2 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulations on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on

incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such establishments 5 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business will help limit and control the adverse secondary effects of such businesses 6 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 7 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 8 the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 9 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the borough will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter 10 limitation of operating hours of sexually oriented businesses to  am to  pm monday closure of such businesses on sundays
