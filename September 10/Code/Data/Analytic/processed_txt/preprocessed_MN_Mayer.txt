criteria of the federal emergency management agency must be satisfied avariances must not be issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result bvariances may only be issued by a community upon the following 1a showing of good and sufficient cause 2a determination that failure to grant the variance would

minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 4flood insurance notice the zoning administrator must notify the applicant for a variance that athe issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  and bsuch construction below the base or

factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional uses in floodplains athe potential danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments  bthe danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others  cthe proposed water supply and sanitation systems if any and the ability of these systems
