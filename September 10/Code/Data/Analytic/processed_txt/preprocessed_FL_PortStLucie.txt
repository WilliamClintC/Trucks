use conversion manual i introduction this section briefly summarizes background factors underlying the land use conversion concept and identifies the purpose and intent of the land use conversion manual in 198283 the city of port st lucie comprehensive plan evaluation and appraisal report identified several land use issues requiring changes in the citys land use plan and related policies issues identified included  platted small singlefamily lots along major roadways have deterred development   need for more diverse housing structure types within the community   shortage of land available for both commercial and institutional facilities  and  traffic flow has been inhibited along major thoroughfares by excessive curbcuts serving singlefamily homes on 80foot lots in response to these issues the city prepared and adopted land use conversion policies to promote 1 assembly of small singlefamily lots along major thoroughfares  and 2 development of multiplefamily residential housing as well as additional commercial and institutional activities on these strategically located sites along major transportation corridors this manual is intended to explain the land use conversion process available conversion options and implementation policies the manual addresses requirements for land assembly rezoning requirements and related site plan and design considerations the manual is intended to facilitate administrative requirements for implementing the comprehensive plan land use conversion policies the land use conversion process is designed to accomplish the following objectives  promote assembly of singlefamily residential lots along strategically located segments of major thoroughfares   encourage welldesigned nonresidential development and multiple family housing with controlled access along major thoroughfares  improve traffic circulation by restricting curbcuts and providing effective systems for offstreet parking and internal circulation   alleviate potential adverse impacts on singlefamily development by mandating standards for building setbacks landscaping screening and buffering  and  foster unified design in land use conversion projects by requiring unity of title and application of good principles of site design ii land use conversion areas and applicable regulations this section identifies the various types of land use conversion areas within the city of port st lucie figure 3 delineates the general location of the conversion areas presented in the city of port st lucie comprehensive plan pages 11 identify the individual conversion areas on small area maps these maps specify the frontage and depth requirements minimum lot size minimum curbcut separation maximum height and rear yard requirements for each individual conversion area in addition table i  summarizes the zoning districts which are compatible for each type of land use conversion iii land assembly requirements required land assembly is primarily determined by major thoroughfare frontage and depth requirements as noted in the individual conversion area maps and illustrated in figure 4  i he minimum required land area is 20000 square feet exceptions to frontage and depth requirements are illustrated in figure 5  minimum area requirementsfrontage and depth requirements the minimum area for a land use conversion site is 20000 square feet although several land use conversion areas require an area upwards to 60000 square feet frontage and depth requirements and typical exceptions to the rule are graphically presented on figures 4 and 5 respectively a major variation of the 20000 square feet minimum area requirement applies to several sites with a depth greater than 125 feet which are located on port st lucie boulevard between airoso boulevard and morningside boulevard on these sites the area extending beyond the 125 feet depth limitation can only be utilized for landscaping buffering retention and other such uses the minimum site size is intended to apply to the total land area which is actually buildable ie the area within the 125 feet buildable depth the only exception occurs when a drainage rightofway tract or a prior conversion precludes combining additional property blocks 8791 102 103 109 117 and 125127 which are located within the prima vista boulevard conversion area map on  prohibit parking areas driveways or structures at a depth greater than 225 feet on these blocks the area extending beyond the 225 feet depth limitation can only be utilized for landscaping buffering retention and other such uses avoiding isolated petitions for the conversion of residentially zoned lands should avoid the isolation of lots which are of insufficient size to meet the performance standards established for a particular conversion area in cases where the petition results in the isolation of such lots the city council shall have the option of denying the petition or requiring the provision of joint driveways and parking lot easements in order to allow the isolated lots to be integrated with adjacent conversion areas which are consistent with the applicable performance standards unified ownership at the time a rezoning application for land use conversion is submitted applicants are required to submit appropriate legal documentation demonstrating conformity with unified ownership of the properties involved the legal department will prepare a unity of title and will record the unity of title after the rezoning is approved by the city council iv rezoning process when the land assembly requirements of the land use conversion process are met the applicant must apply for a zoning map amendment inclusive of the zoning the zoning process including detailed stipulations governing procedures and timing considerations major factors included in the rezoning procedures are identified below rezoning application and filing fee an application for amending the zoning map should be obtained from the zoning administrator the application for amendment must 1 be signed by the applicant  2 include the applicants name and address  and 3 be verified under oath by the applicant pursuant to the zoning applications for amending the zoning be submitted to the zoning administrator accompanied by a filing fee the filing fee will be as established by the city council to cover the expenses of handling the amendment application providing public notice taking an official record at public hearings and for other purposes no fee will be refunded except as expressly authorized by the city council review of the rezoning application rezoning applications are reviewed by the city planner who forwards comments and recommendations to the planning and zoning board the planning and zoning board establishes a date for a public hearing and carries out notice requirements of the zoning city council considers the recommendations of the planning and zoning board and convenes at least one public hearing prior to acting on the rezoning petition procedures for a city council public hearing and notice requirements are established in the zoning interested person has the right to submit oral or written testimony at the subject public hearings however evidence which is immaterial irrelevant or unduly repetitious may be excluded from the official record on the application criteria for review and timing of the rezoning process the application for rezoning within land use conversion areas is evaluated based on its relationship to the comprehensive plan or element or portion thereof no application for land use conversion may be approved if it is found to be inconsistent with the adopted comprehensive plan the rezoning process generally requires 60 to 90 days however the process can extend over a much longer duration in cases where divisive development issues arise a flow chart of the rezoning process including timing considerations is presented in figure 2  v site plan and design considerations several site plan and design considerations are mandated as prerequisites for a land conversion project this section identifies such requirements including offstreet parking  curbcut limitations and joint access agreements  building height restrictions and rear yard setback provisions  landscaping screening and buffering  and unified ownership offstreet parking zoning for multiplefamily residential development will not be approved within land use conversion areas unless compliance with offstreet parking requirements and curbcut restrictions are demonstrated such demonstration must include legal assurances for accommodating present and possible future needs for joint use of offstreet parking access ways and curbcuts in order to avoid undue proliferation of curb cuts on major thoroughfares the zoning detailed offstreet parking provisions controlled curbcuts and joint access agreements are discussed below curbcuts the minimum distance between curbcuts providing access to land use conversion areas along major thoroughfares must be 150 feet and the minimum distance from a street intersection must be 180 feet curbcuts must be restricted to locations abutting a major thoroughfare as opposed to local residential streets excepting allowable side street access points approved as part of the site plan review process the city ordinances includes a variance procedure an applicant may request a variance to stipulate curbcut restrictions however no such variance can be granted unless variance criteria established in the zoning met in addition the following assumptions must be satisfied 1 all other performance standards are satisfied  2 plans for vehicular bicycle and pedestrian circulation indicate that projected traffic generation will not adversely impact traffic flow on or off the site  3 no other feasible traffic circulation plan is available to service the site  4 the density andor intensity of development proposed for the site is determined not to exceed a reasonable threshold considering site limitations traffic impacts and the need to maintain safe and convenient access along major thoroughfares  and 5 the applicant has agreed to provide improvements or other equitable contributions which may be necessary to protect against adverse transportation impacts joint access agreements rezoning petitions for land use conversion which result in isolated lots incapable of meeting the offstreet parking requirements and curbcut restrictions shall be denied by the city council or required to acquire agreements from adjacent developments for joint driveways and parking lot easements all joint access parking agreements must be submitted as part of the rezoning application and must be approved by the city attorney prior to approval of the petition preparation of joint access agreements must reflect specifications consistent with access standards within the city zoning addition per the city of port st lucie citywide design standards pedestrian and vehicular connections shall be provided between adjacent parcels and buildings at the time of site plan approval crossaccess agreements shall be obtained by adjacent property owners special height and yard requirements the maximum height of any structure developed with a medium density residential rm or residentialofficeinstitutional roi land use

singlefamily residential district or use landscape screening and buffering proposals for development within land use conversion areas shall demonstrate compliance with landscape and screening requirements of the city ordinances in addition a solid masonry wall six feet in height above the finished floor elevation of the primary building shall buffer the multiplefamily residential development from all directly abutting singlefamily residential district zoning unity of title a recorded unity of title is required for all land included within site plans for development of multiplefamily or nonresidential uses within land use conversion areas the unity of title is prepared and recorded by the citys legal department upon the submittal by the applicant of appropriate legal documentation demonstrating conformity with unified ownership of the properties involved vi variance procedures on  the city council approved for a land use change to the bayshore area the ordinance included a new policy to the comprehensive plan which reads as follows policy 12 a manual shall be established to implement conversion areas of the future land use map it shall include development of performance standards to allow conversions and include variance procedures for exceptions to such standards only in appropriate locations the planning and zoning board shall review these variance requests and forward a recommendation to the city council for final approval or denial authority regarding such requests the new policy recognizes that there are certain properties which cannot comply with the development standards as outlined in this manual for instance those properties which have drainage rightsofway which prohibit the ability to have enough road frontage for those properties and others which exhibit undue hardship a variance process can be applied for to waive such requirements and allow for rezoning before making a recommendation on the variance request the planning and zoning board shall hold a public hearing per the citys zoning recommendation of the planning and zoning board is forwarded to the city council for final action by motion in order to meet the intent of the approved policy the following performance standards are to be applied 1 any application which would result in adjacent lots becoming nonconforming to the conversion standards

site and remaining properties 3 where appropriate the plan shall be designed as one project and must provide for shared access and parking of any remaining or adjacent lots or parcels which would not conform to the conversion standards as a result of the variance it shall not result in isolation or landlocked lots without providing access 4 the plan shall not allow for access onto residential streets or nonconversion area streets 5 the plan shall require the recording of unity of title for the project to prohibit further division and sale of separate lots which were a part of the overall approved site plan also recording of access easements for future use of the remaining adjacent lots is required verification of this is required prior to the issuance of building permits for the

management system footnotes  1  editors note  adopted apr 12 199 repealed and replaced chapter 160 in its entirety to read as herein set out article i  general provisions introduction a on  the city council adopted the citys revised and updated comprehensive plan the adoption of the comprehensive plan was required by the local government comprehensive planning and land development regulation act fs ch 163 pt ii as amended a primary objective of which is to effectively manage the problems associated with floridas rapid population growth a key element of the act fs  10h is the concept of concurrency expressed as follows it is the intent of the legislature that public facilities and services needed to support development shall be available concurrent with the impacts of such development b the act accordingly required that each local government adopt locally acceptable levels of service los for its various public facilities and services roads sanitary sewer solid waste drainage potable water parks and recreation and mass transit if applicable and then provide for the capital improvements necessary to maintain those adopted levels of service in addition the act fs  2g prohibits local government from issuing a development order or permit which results in a reduction in the service for the affected public facilities below the level of service provided in the comprehensive plan of the local government c this section of the act is required to be implemented adoption of local land development regulations the act fs  3b also requires that the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan shall be reviewed on an annual basis and modified as necessary  41299 purpose and intent a the concurrency management system will provide the necessary regulatory mechanism for evaluating development orders to ensure that adequate public facilities and services are available concurrent with development impacts the adoption of the port st lucie comprehensive plan and its various elements established acceptable level of service standards for roads potable water sanitary sewer solid waste drainage and parks and recreation facilities b an additional component of the concurrency management system is the establishment of a framework for determining public facility and service needs and providing a basis for meeting those needs improvements planning the capital improvements element in the comprehensive plan identifies the schedule of capital facility projects and funding mechanisms currently necessary to maintain adequate public facilities and services at or above the adopted level of service standards c the concurrency management system in accordance with the requirements of fs  2g and fac  9j1h and  9js0055 is intended to implement the citys comprehensive plan and specifically address the requirements outlined in the following elements of the plan future land use traffic circulation infrastructure coastal management recreation and open space intergovernmental coordination and capital improvements elements d the implementation of the concurrency management system will serve as the principal mechanism for ensuring that future growth is managed in a manner consistent with the provisions of the comprehensive plan as well as provide a key monitoring device for measuring the effectiveness of the comprehensive plan and the programming of future capital improvements  41299 definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
