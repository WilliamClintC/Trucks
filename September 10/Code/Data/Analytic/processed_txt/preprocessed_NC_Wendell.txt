framework plan was derived the framework plan is a policy map intended to provide guidance to wendells leaders as they make decisions on where and how the community should grow the transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environments as a continuum of six conditions ranging from rural to urban the value of the transect is that it classifies development form with the appropriate land use and development context for example a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings look like farmhouses or barns an urban street depending on the intensity of urbanism may have curbs and gutters regularly placed street trees sidewalks and building forms that include common walls flat roofs and cornices each transect zoning category has detailed provisions for the mix of uses building type density height street design the design of parks and open space the mix of uses building design parking streetscape and other aspects of the human environment t1 & t2 natural & rural zones the transect begins with two zones that are rural in character the natural zone or t1 which is made up of lands protected in perpetuity as natural recreational or agricultural areas  and the rural zone t2 which includes areas of high agricultural scenic or environmental value that should be protected t3 suburban zone the transition zone between countryside and town is called the suburban zone t3 the t3 area consists primarily of single family homes although the t3 area is primarily a residential zone it may have other development types such as schools and other civic uses t4 general urban zone t4 development is primarily residential but more urban in character having a higher density with a mix of housing types and a greater mix of uses including neighborhoodserving commercial uses t5 urban center zone at the more urban end of the spectrum is the urban center zone or t5 this can be a small neighborhood center or a larger communitytown center the latter serving more than one neighborhood t6 urban core zone the urban core or downtown t6 serves not only adjacent neighborhoods but the entire town and the region it is typically the central business district where the greatest mix of uses occurs special districts the special districts make allowance for specialized activities and development types such as big box retail institutional campuses and industrial zones the zoning districts for the town of wendell have been ordered along the ruralurban transect providing for appropriate development standards along the continuum rather than a onesizefits all approach as well as a simplified tool for users of this facilitate appropriate forms of development the graphic on this page shows the defining features of various types of developments along the ruralurban transect spectrum a establishment of base districts in accordance with north carolina general statute 160a382 that sets forth the establishment of zoning regulation by district the town of wendell is hereby divided into various zoning districts that set forth uniform regulations for the development of land within each district these district regulations are intended to provide a regulating plan for the use of land and buildings in standards of good health and safety and in conditions of orderly community development these regulations

general classification within the same industry classification is also listed for another use the specific classification governs a specific use is not permitted in all districts where uses assigned to the general classification are permitted simply because they share a similar lbcs code number the numbers increase as the use classifications get more specific b some uses are listed separately but

widths and locations shall be clearly delineated on all plans final plat and asbuilts n general standards 1 downstream impact analysis the downstream impact analysis must be performed in accordance with the ten percent rule and a copy of the analysis must be provided with the permit application the purpose of the downstream impact analysis is to determine if the project will cause any unintentional additional impacts on flooding or channel degradation downstream of the project site the analysis must include the assumptions results and supporting calculations to show safe passage of postdevelopment design flows downstream this analysis shall be performed at the outlets of the site and downstream at each tributary junction to the points in the conveyance system where the area of the portion of the site draining into the system is less than or equal to ten percent of the total drainage area above that point the typical steps in the application of the ten percent rule are a using a topographical map determine the point downstream where the proposed site equals ten percent of the total drainage area called ten percent point identify all tributary junctions between the downstream site boundary and the ten percent point all points identified as well as the outlet of the site are known as ten percent rule comparison points b using a hydraulic model with existing land uses determine the predevelopment peak runoff rate cfs for the tenyear design storm event at each comparison point c insert the proposed site design and proposed bmps into land uses and determine the postdevelopment peak runoff rate for the tenyear design storm at each comparison point d if the tenyear postdevelopment peak discharge rate is greater than the predevelopment discharge rate at any comparison point then one of the following actions must be taken i revise the site plan for the proposed site to incorporate better use of natural features design additional structural control facilities reduce impervious cover or alter timing of peak flows to lower postdevelopment flows at each comparison point to predevelopment levels ii obtain a flow easement from downstream property owners ten percent point where the postdevelopment peak discharge rate is higher than the predevelopment peak discharge rate iii work with the town to determine other acceptable approaches to reduce

flood damage protection statutory authorization the legislature of the state of north carolina has in of   parts 3 5 and 8 of of   and of of the north carolina general statutes delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the board of commissioners of the town of wendell north carolina does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town of wendell are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 those flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions by materials such as trees limbs sediment construction debris etc in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this section to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within flood prone areas and provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and all other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands d objectives the objectives of this  to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in flood prone areas  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and 7 to ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area e definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application accessory structure appurtenant structure means a structure which is located on the same parcel of property as the principal

infrastructure it is an essential part of the development review process to assist developers and government agencies in making land use decisions involving annexations subdivisions rezonings special land uses and other development reviews the tia helps identify where the development may have a significant impact on safety traffic and transportation operations and provides a means for the developer and government agencies to mitigate these impacts ultimately the tia can be used to evaluate whether the scale of development is appropriate for a particular site and what improvements may be necessary on and off the site to provide safe and efficient access and traffic flow a a tia shall be required for a rezoning conditional district subdivision plan site plan special use permit

applicant shall be required to upgrade the facilities in accordance with the adopted level of service program mitigation measures may involve strategies other than roadway construction or other physical improvements such as changes to traffic signal timing or phasing and transportation management strategies d thresholds for mitigation the town requires consideration of roadway andor operational improvements when the proposed development increases the intersection volumetocapacity ratio vc beyond the thresholds indicated in the table below the town evaluates the impacts of proposed development at intersections primarily under existing year conditions based on the increase in vc ratio as a result of the projected site traffic this increase is determined by comparing the vc ratio under existing development conditions and proposed development conditions for the purposes of this comparison all nonsignalized intersections are analyzed as signalized intersections existing
