businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial government concerns t a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein u removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments v the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spreading of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity w it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 924 x the fact than an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this chapter y the barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten 10 years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases z the general
