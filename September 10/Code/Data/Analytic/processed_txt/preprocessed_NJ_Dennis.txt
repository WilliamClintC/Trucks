residential zones and nonconforming commercial uses furthermore commercial uses in the township tend to be scattered or isolated in location and not clustered in specific zones as may be the case in more traditionally zoned and developed municipalities c accordingly business licensing in dennis township does not only serve the usual purpose of ascertaining the financial and technical qualifications of businessmen to do business in the township rather commercial licensing in dennis township is also necessary so that the township may know where commercial establishments are located may properly and efficiently enforce zoning and building particularly those dealing with home occupations or nonconforming commercial uses may appropriately plan its response in cases of fire or other

in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes if inadequately or improperly managed this stormwater runoff can deplete groundwater resources and increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants c increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land development and contribute to the degradation of the water resources of dennis

protection and the pinelands commission promote and promulgate the use of nitrate dilution models for land use purposes 7 it is desirable and necessary to regulate development processes and activities
