part is represented in the number for example section  is section 010 in chapter 204 of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty definitions the titles in this separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example chapter 206 borough manager can be added between 204 borough council and chapter 208 borough attorney section of the substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the

subject matter and derived from 12   statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives a statutory authorization the legislature of the state of new jersey has in njsa 1 et seq delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the governing body of borough of stratford of new jersey does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the borough of stratford are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  2 8142007   definitions unless specifically defined below words or
