prevail whenever the provisions of any other ordinance require more restrictive standards than are required herein the more restrictive requirements shall prevail flood damage prevention note to historical note the provisions of this chapter are derived from an ordinance adopted  unless otherwise indicated the city adopted an additional flood damage prevention ordinance on  that ordinance is not included herein but is on file in the city offices general provisions 561statutory authorization the legislature of the state of south carolina has in sc laws title 5 chapters 7 23 and 25 articles 5 and 7 and title 6 amendments thereto delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of west columbia south carolina does ordain as follows 562findings of fact the flood hazard areas of west columbia are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 563statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally this chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of this chapter are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs 564lands to which this chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of west columbia as identified by the federal emergency management agency in its flood insurance study dated  with accompanying maps

intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter and another conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail 568partial invalidity and severability if any part of this chapter is declared invalid the remainder of the chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in force 569warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter shall not create liability on the part of west columbia or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder 5610penalties for violation violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its
