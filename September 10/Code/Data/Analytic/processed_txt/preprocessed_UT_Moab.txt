adopts the following annexation policy declaration 1sound urban development is essential to the continued economic development of this state  2municipalities are created to provide urban governmental services essential for sound urban development and for the protection of public health safety and welfare in residential commercial and industrial areas and in areas undergoing development  3municipal boundaries should be extended in accordance with specific standards to include areas where a high quality of urban governmental services is needed and can be provided for the protection of public health safety and welfare and to avoid the inequities of double taxation and the proliferation of special service districts  4areas annexed to municipalities in accordance with appropriate standards should receive the services provided by the annexing municipality as soon as possible following the annexation  5areas annexed to municipalities should include all of the urbanized unincorporated areas contiguous to municipalities securing to residents within the areas a voice in the selection of their government  6decisions with respect to municipal boundaries and urban development need to be made with adequate consideration of the effect of the proposed actions on adjacent areas and on the interests of other government entities on the need for and cost of local government services and the ability to deliver the services under the proposed actions and on factors related to population growth and density and the geography of the area  and bmap showing the anticipated future extent of the city of moabs boundaries and areas that are more readily available for service 1this portion of the city of moabs master annexation policy declaration describes the geographic areas considered most

corner of said said point being the point of beginning ccriteria as required by state law together with additional criteria and policies for city acceptance of an annexation 1the city endorses the intent of the utah annexation act uca 102401 et seq as amended criteria for annexation of property to the city are as follows athe property must be contiguous to the boundaries of the city bthe property must lie within the area projected for the city municipal expansion cthe property must not be included within the boundaries of another incorporated municipality dthe annexation must not create unincorporated islands within the boundaries of the city ethe property proposed to be annexed hereunder will not be annexed for the sole purpose of acquiring municipal revenue or for retarding the capacity of any other municipality to annex into the same or related area 2the city will evaluate the following for each annexation acompliance with all requirements of appropriate state code provisions bthe current and potential population of the area and the current residential densities cland uses proposed in addition to those presently existing dthe assessed valuation of the current properties or proposed uses ethe potential demand for various municipal services especially those requiring capital improvements frecommendations of other local government jurisdictions regarding the proposal and potential impact of the annexation ghow the proposed area andor its potential land uses would contribute to the achievement of the goals and policies of the city hidentification of any special districts or county departments that are currently providing services if the proposed area is receiving services that are to be assumed by the city a statement should be included indicating that steps can be taken to assure an effective transition in the delivery of services a timetable for extending services should be included if the city is unable to provide services immediately if the proposed area is receiving services that are not going to be assumed by the city a statement to that effect will be included in the annexation agreement iif an application for annexation includes a specific proposal for urban development an understanding as to the provision of improvements should be concluded between the city and the applicant jnew annexations should create areas in which services can be provided efficiently the annexation should not create geographically isolated areas areas for which the provision of services would be costly or difficult or an area in which surface water runoff would create multijurisdictional problems kthe tax consequences for affected entities should be addressed 3in order to facilitate orderly growth the following city policies will apply to every annexation proposal however compliance with any policy not expressly required by state law is not mandatory and failure to comply with any policy not expressly required by state law shall in no way affect or jeopardize an annexation petition that otherwise meets the standards established in the utah the citys policy is to consider annexation only in those areas where the city has the potential to provide urban services either directly or cooperative agreement these areas may include locations served or to be served by city utilities electrical service police and fire protection facilities etc bthe city declares its interest in those areas identified in this policy declaration and other areas lying within onehalf mile of the citys boundary any urban development as defined by state law proposed within this specified area is subject to review and approval of the city as provided in uca 102418 as amended cdue to the extraterritorial powers granted as part of the utah boundary commission act the city may exercise its initiative to prepare and adopt a general plan for future development in those extraterritorial areas of interest for future annexation as indicated in this policy declaration this general plan will define proposed land uses nature and density of development desired by the city in each particular area once this ordinance is adopted any proposed development in an area to be annexed must conform to the general plan notwithstanding said plan may be amended from time to time as deemed necessary and appropriate dit is the policy of the city to require new development in annexed areas to comply with all city standards and regulatory laws proposed actions to be taken to overcome deficiencies should be identified and costs estimated eto avoid creation of islands and peninsulas unincorporated territory and publiclyowned land such as roadways schools parks or recreational land may be annexed as part of other logical annexations fin order to facilitate orderly growth and development in the city the planning commission may review a proposed annexation and make recommendations to the city council concerning the parcel to be annexed the effect on city development and the recommended zoning district designation for the proposed annexed area review by the planning commission is not a requirement for annexation and approval from the planning commission is not necessary for annexation gthe city council shall designate the zoning for the territory being annexed in the ordinance annexing the territory the zoning designations must be consistent with the general plan the city council shall not be bound by the zoning designations for the territory prior to annexation nothing in this section shall be construed as allowing the city council to change zoning designations in areas that are already within the municipal boundaries without following the procedures for zoning amendments found in the city code hlandowners petitioning for annexation must file an application and follow the procedures for annexation required by state law and the procedures specified by the city ithe city may require an annexation fee reasonable to the cost incurred as part of the annexation process jfrom time to time the city may amend this master annexation policy declaration this policy declaration including maps may be amended by the city council after at least fourteen days notice and public hearing annexation policy declarations for individual annexations may be considered amendments to this master annexation policy declaration and likewise require adequate notice and public hearing as herein specified dthe character of the community 1the areas anticipated for future annexation contain a wide variety of land uses there is vacant land as well as residentially developed property and property developed and being developed for commercial uses 2the city was incorporated in  and has entertained numerous proposals for annexation since that time recent interest in annexation has been shown by many surrounding property owners this policy declaration will help to define those areas that the city will consider in a favorable manner ethe need for municipal services in developing unincorporated areas 1the city recognizes that municipal services to developed areas which may be annexed should to the greatest extent possible be provided by the city it may however negotiate service agreements in annexing areas 2for developing unincorporated areas to be annexed to the city general government services and public safety service will be provided by the city as the area is annexed and developed where feasible and in the public interest to the citizens of the city public utility services will be provided by the city or appropriate utility companies or improvement districts 3subsequent policy declarations on individual parcels will address provision of utility service to that particular area determination of how utility service will be provided to developing areas proposed for annexation will be developed following discussion with the public works department and other appropriate utility officials or entities ffinancing and time frame for the extension of municipal services 1those areas identified in this master policy declaration as being favorable for annexation are located near to the city a basic network of collector roads presently exists in many of these areas and the city can readily extend such services as police protection street maintenance and general government services unless otherwise specified city services for police and street maintenance will begin in newly annexed areas immediately following the effective date of annexation 2services for newly annexed areas will be provided for out of the general andor enterprise funds however it is the citys policy that all new development in areas requiring service bears the burden of providing necessary facilities if and when the property sought to be annexed is developed the developer will have to construct and install appropriate municipal service facilities such as streets curb gutter sidewalk water and sewer lines as provided by city code construction of water andor sewer line extensions involving multiple properties will be phased to coincide with the financial readiness of said property owners and the city 3if services in an annexed area are substandard then the financing of improvements to bring the area up to city standards may be necessary means as a special improvement district the city may decline to annex areas that contain significant substandard improvements the site annexation policy declaration submitted with individual annexations will identify a schedule for necessary improvements to the area 4unless otherwise agreed by the city in writing the annexation of real property into the municipal limits shall not obligate the city to construct or install utilities or other public infrastructure the decision to extend or install such improvements shall be vested solely in the discretion of the city council gthe estimate of tax consequences the estimate of tax consequences to residents in both new and old territory of the city resulting from the proposed future annexations cannot be accurately assessed at this time as each annexation proposal occurs the city will review the tax consequences of that annexation haffected entities the following is a list of potentiallyaffected entities to which copies of the annexation policy declaration has been supplied prior to its

moab are subject to periodic inundation that may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains that cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage   purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to aprotect human life and health and prevent substantial loss or damage to real property  bminimize expenditure of public money for costly

flood area  and hto ensure that those persons who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods arestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural
