ellington governor this is to certify that according to the official records on file in this office house bill no 655 which is of the private acts of 196 was properly ratified and approved and is therefore operative and in effect in accordance with its provisions joe c carr secretary of state subpart 2  related private acts priv acts 198 ch 114 franklin adequate facilities tax act priv acts 198 ch 117 franklin construction impact fee act priv acts 199 ch 188 franklin hotelmotel occupancy tax act chapter no 114 house bill no 1308 by frensley hobbs substituted for senate bill no 1320 by richardson an act to authorize the city of franklin to levy and collect a privilege tax on new development in the city in order to provide that new development contribute its fair share of the cost of providing public facilities and services made necessary by such new development whereas williamson county tennessee where franklin is the county seat has been the fastest growing county in the state for the past fifteen 15 years having been impacted by the rapid growth in the standard metropolitan area of nashville  and whereas anticipated continued growth from the expansion of nashville is expected to accelerate due to the location of the hub of american airlines in the nashville area and from other factors  and whereas after an intense national competition the state of tennessee successfully negotiated with the general motors corporation to locate its saturn plant in tennessee  and whereas general motors corporation selected and is presently constructing the saturn automotive assembly plant in an unincorporated area of maury county just south of the williamson county line at spring hill  and whereas the investment in said plant is anticipated to be approximately $35 billion when the plant is complete  and whereas maury county has negotiated a payment in lieu of tax pilot agreement with general motors whereby the saturn plant will make payments in lieu of property tax in the amount of $ million over the next fifteen 15 years but the city of franklin lying within a few miles of the plant has no such agreement and will receive no such benefit  and whereas the saturn plant is anticipated to stimulate commercial office industrial and warehouse development in franklin in the vicinity of the saturn plant  and whereas the projected nonresidential development and the availability of jobs is anticipated to stimulate a significant demand for new dwelling units in franklin  and whereas current projections show that 1 county population will be 129000 persons in year 200 an increase of 122% from 1980 to 2005  there will be a demand for approximately 22000 additional dwelling units between 1980 and 2005  and new residential and nonresidential development shall consume an additional 14000 acres of land in williamson county  2 projected growth and land use development will cause a demand for county provided capital facilities schools roads jails parks etc in an amount well in excess of $50 million over the next fifteen 15 years  3 the citys present revenue raising authority is limited and relies heavily on intergovernmental transfers which are not subject to city control and on property taxes which would impose the costs of new growth on existing residents rather than on new residents and businesses who create the demand for the additional expenditures  and whereas franklin is committed to both present and future county residents in maintaining a level of public facilities and services commensurate with those presently provided  and whereas franklin is prepared to impose a fair equitable and reasonable share of the costs of providing the necessary public facilities and services on existing residents of the county  and whereas the citys present population employment base tax base and budget cannot alone support the additional revenues needed to supply facilities to serve new growth without a substantial increase in the property tax rate on existing development  and whereas the introduction of the saturn plant in maury county the american airlines hub in davidson county and the continued expansion of the nashville metropolitan area represent both an extraordinary economic opportunity for the state of tennessee as well as a potential economic burden on the existing residents of franklin  and whereas due to these unique circumstances it is necessary and appropriate that franklin be given authorization to extend its taxing power to enable the city to impose a fair and reasonable share of the costs of public facilities necessitated by new development on that development so as not to create an unfair and inequitable burden on existing city residents  and whereas there is precedent in the state of tennessee for such additional tax measures to impose costs on those who benefit from improvements and where the result would otherwise be to impose an unfair burden on existing residents  and whereas the most logical and effective mechanism to accomplish the intended result would be the imposition of a new privilege tax on new development in franklin  now therefore be it enacted by the general assembly of the state of tennessee this act shall be known and cited as the franklin adequate facilities tax as used in this act unless a different meaning appears from the context a building means any structure

nfip and in order to do so must meet the nfip regulations found in title 44 of the federal regulations cfr  areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 3 flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods  or construction which is inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c statement of purpose the purpose of this to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas this designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including community facilities be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands d objectives the objectives of this  to protect human life health safety and property  2 to minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in flood prone areas  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas to minimize blight in flood areas  7 to ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood prone area  and 8 to maintain eligibility for participation in the nfip  general provisions a basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard 1 the areas

necessary deviation from the requirements of this preserve the historic character and design of the structure  3 in passing upon variance applications the bza shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors this  a the danger that materials may be swept onto other property to the injury of others  b the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion  c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage  d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e the necessity of the facility to a waterfront location in the case of a functionally dependent use  f the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use  g the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  h the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  i the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and j the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems and streets and bridges 4 upon consideration of the factors listed above

floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result b conditions for variances 1 variances shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary considering the flood hazard and the factors listed in paragraph a 2 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship  or c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisance cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance as high as $25 for $100 coverage
