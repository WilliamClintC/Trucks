the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of marilyn dobbelare city clerk the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 14 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates

organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections

standpipe is graded to allow surface runoff to drain into the standpipe opening the standpipe shall be covered with a trash rack or other suitable grated intake to help ensure safety and prevent larger debris from entering the standpipe wherever possible the area immediately surrounding the improved sinkhole is established as a vegetated buffer as a means of filtration to prevent sediment and other contaminants from entering the standpipe the city shall acquire a permanent easement for perpetual maintenance of the improved sinkhole as set forth in in general the agricultural areas within the city limits will minimally require a 50foot easement measured from the center of the standpipe to be used as a vegetative buffer area in other areas within the city limits the preferred easement

parts 405471 1 where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the city administrator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with this section 2 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the city administrator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 3 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the city administrator shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e 4 a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section a categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of this section are met b criteria i either 1 the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or 2 the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters ii credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere iii credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section iv credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result 5 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the city administrator the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in the following paragraphs of this section a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must i employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit ii currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment iii provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions iv not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge v have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits b an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must i maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits ii continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device iii continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the city administrator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in this section upon notification of a revised production rate the city administrator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility iv continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the city administrator i will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor ii upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility iii may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to this section the industrial user must also be in compliance with this chapter regarding the prohibition of bypass 6 the city administrator may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the city administrator 7 once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 8 many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation 9 any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the city administrator within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the city administrator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate c state pretreatment standards users must comply with missouri state pretreatment standards codified at 10 csr 20 d citys right of revision the city reserves the right to establish by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the potw consistent with the purpose of this chapter e dilution no user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement the city administrator may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate  7715   10615   1 3519   wastewater pretreatment a pretreatment facilities users shall provide wastewater

enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in this chapter or the specific prohibitions in this chapter if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 for the purposes of this section a bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass

against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance c the user submitted notices as required under this section 2 the city administrator may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the city administrator determines that it will meet the three conditions

with  floodplain management article 1  statutory authorization findings of fact and purposes   statutory authorization the legislature of the state of missouri has in rsmo delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect health safety and general welfare therefore the board of aldermen of the city of perryville missouri ordains as set forth hereinafter  71911   findings of fact a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of perryville missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis illustrative materials and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles is based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood  71911   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in this code  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 federal regulations cfr 603b by applying the provisions of this chapter to a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  b require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses  be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and c protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard  71911 general provisions   lands to which
