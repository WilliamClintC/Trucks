reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same period and under similar circumstances and conditions where past water consumption records are not available the variable charges will be adjusted to reflect the average water consumption for similar accounts no adjustment to the sewer bill will be allowed where it is determined that excess water consumption is due to the apparent continued waste of water due to a negligent failure to repair a leak     public sewers required 1 connection requirements all property with buildings or

review criteria  overview the development nondiscretionary and discretionary standards for the city to use in evaluating how land use proposals comply with the use and development requirements of the nondiscretionary criteria provide clear and objective standards for certainty in most situations discretionary criteria provide flexibility by allowing more subjective standards and objectives and allow modification of regulations in response to specific site conditions this chapter contains the criteria for evaluation of the following land use applications  adjustments  annexations  comprehensive plan and map amendments  conditional uses  development nonconforming situations  site plan review  vacations  variances major  variances minor  zoning map amendments 1200  1209  0121  function of review criteria 1 review criteria describe the issues the applicant must address and that the city or affected parties may raise a proposal that complies with all of the criteria will be approved a proposal that can comply with the criteria with mitigation measures or limitations will be approved with conditions a proposal that cannot comply with the criteria outright or with mitigation measures will be denied 2 the review criteria are derived from the comprehensive plan reviews against the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan are not required unless specifically stated the proposal conforms to the comprehensive plan if it fulfills the review criteria 3 when review criteria require an application to meet a specific standard such as adequate services or no negative offsite impacts all proposed improvements and mitigation measures must be identified before the review body will make a final decision 1209  burden of proof the applicant must show that the review criteria are met the burden of proof is not on the city or other parties to show that the criteria have or have not been met  conditions of approval the city may attach conditions to the approval of a land use decision in order to ensure that the proposal will conform to the applicable review criteria  relationship to other regulations when a land use application is approved based on review criteria in this the applicant must still comply with other applicable codes ordinances statutes and regulations adjustments  purpose the adjustment review allows the director to approve modifications to the application of most design standards in buffering and screening standards in as noted in those articles the adjustment review process provides a mechanism by which the standards in the adc may be modified if the proposed development continues to meet the intended purpose of those regulations adjustment reviews provide flexibility for unusual situations they also allow for alternative ways to meet the purposes of the 0121  procedures adjustment applications are processed type iii procedure 0121 albany development   review criteria for each standard for which an adjustment is requested the applicant must show that the following criteria have been met 1 granting the adjustment will equally or better meet the purpose of the regulation to be modified  and 2 the proposal will be consistent with the desired character of the base zone  and 3 any negative impacts resulting from the adjustment are mitigated to the extent practical  and 4 the proposal will not significantly detract from the livability or appearance of the surrounding area  and 5 if more than one adjustment is being requested the cumulative effect of the adjustments results in a project which still meets criteria 1 4 above 0121 annexations  purpose annexation is the first step in converting land in the albany urban growth boundary to urban land annexation and subsequent development

areas are addressed in and may not require a minor variance  procedures minor variance applications are processed type il procedure requests not meeting the purpose of minor variances may be processed as major variances the director will determine whether an application is processed as a minor variance or a major variance  review criteria the applicant must show that the following criteria have been met 1 the minor variance is not requested to avoid a land use review process or increase density  and 2 the need for the minor variance is created by the unusual configuration of the property to protect natural features due to the location of an existing structure on the site or the site is an infill or redevelopment site less than one acre with development on both sides  and 3 the minor

residential zones are intended to preserve land for housing this the character of neighborhoods by providing seven zones with different density standards the site development standards allow for flexibility of development while maintaining compatibility within the citys various neighborhoods these regulations provide certainty to property owners developers and neighbors by stating the allowed uses and development standards for the base zones sites within overlay districts are also subject to the regulations in articles 6 and 7 2707 the list below is a summary of the topics covered in this article  zoning districts  schedule of permitted use  development standards zoning districts  establishment of residential zoning districts in order to regulate and segregate the uses of lands and buildings and to regulate the density of development the following residential zoning districts are established 1 rrresidential reserve district the rr district is intended to recognize areas which because of topography level of services or other natural or development factors are best served by a large lot designation this district may be applied on an interim basis until urban services become available the minimum lot size is five acres 2 rs10residential singlefamily district the rs10 district is intended primarily for a lower density singlefamily residential environment the average minimum lot size is 10000 square feet 3 rs65residential singlefamily district the rs65 district is intended primarily for lowdensity urban singlefamily residential development the average minimum lot

permitted uses found in this 1 the schedule of permitted uses cannot anticipate all uses that may be located within the city there are also situations where proposed uses may relate to more than one type of use in both instances the director will determine the appropriate use category based on operating characteristics and land use impacts where ambiguity exists concerning the appropriate classification of a particular use the use may be reviewed as a conditional use where the director determines that the proposed use is consistent with other uses allowable within the subject district due to similar characteristics use categories not listed in the schedule of permitted uses are not permitted in the residential zoning districts 2707  0121 2 where a development proposal involves a combination of uses other than accessory uses the more restrictive provisions of this apply for example if a portion of a development is subject to conditional use approval and the balance is subject only to site plan review the entire development shall be reviewed using the conditional use criteria if concurrent approval of all uses is requested 0121 3 a change in the use of a property is subject to review as specified by the schedule of permitted uses a when the change involves a change from one use category to another in the schedule of permitted uses and the director has not waived review

this article are intended to provide land for commercial office and industrial uses the differences among the zones in the permitted uses and development standards reflect the existing and potential intensities of commercial and industrial development the site development standards allow for flexibility of development while minimizing impacts on surrounding uses the regulations in this article promote uses and development that will enhance the economic viability of specific commercial and industrial areas and the city as a whole development may also be subject to the provisions in design standards onsite development and environmental standards and public improvements sites within overlay districts are also subject to the provisions in special purpose districts and historic overlay districts 703 the following list is a summary of the topics covered in this article  zoning districts  schedule of permitted uses  development standards  airport approach overlay district zoning districts  establishment of commercial and industrial zoning districts in order to regulate and segregate the uses of lands and buildings and to regulate the density of development the following commercial and industrial zoning districts are created 1 op  office professional district the op district is intended to provide a vertical or horizontal mix of professional offices personal services livework residential and limited related commercial uses in close proximity to residential and commercial districts the limited uses allowed in this district are selected for their compatibility with residential uses and the desired character of the neighborhood op is typically appropriate along arterial or collector streets as a transitional or buffer zone between residential and more intense commercial or industrial districts 2 nc  neighborhood commercial district the nc district is intended primarily for small areas of retail establishments serving nearby residents frequent needs in convenient locations the nc district is typically appropriate for small clusters or service centers located at intersections within residential neighborhoods businesses should fit into the residential pattern of development and not create land use architectural or traffic conflicts generally uses located within nc districts should have as their primary market area the population within a onehalf mile radius 3 cc  community commercial district the cc district recognizes the diversity of small to mediumscale businesses services and sites mostly located on arterial streets and highways design guidelines building location and frontyard landscaping will provide a coordinated and enhanced community image along these major transportation corridors as they develop or redevelop sound and visual buffers should be used to mitigate impacts on nearby residential areas 4 rc  regional commercial district the rc district is intended primarily for developments that serve the wider albany region rc allows a wide range of retail sales and service uses and is typically appropriate for developments that require large sites near interstate 5 design guidelines building location and frontyard landscaping will provide an enhanced community image along major transportation corridors these uses often have significant impacts on the transportation system sound and visual buffers may be required to protect nearby residential areas rc districts may not be appropriate in all locations albany development  2  5 td  transit district the td district is intended primarily for regional transit facilities and related uses this district is suitable as a major office employment center because of easy access to mass transit mixeduse development including a multimodal transportation facility a parkandride facility and office space should be developed within this district 6 ip  industrial park district the ip district is intended primarily for light manufacturing hightech research and development institutions and offices in a quality environment uses are characterized by attractive building architecture and landscaped yards and streetscapes and the absence of objectionable external effects the district is designed for industrial and business parks containing offices together with clean nonpolluting industries ip is located along or near highly visible corridors to provide a positive image and a transition to residential or natural areas from heavier industrial uses 7 li  light industrial district the li district is intended primarily for a wide range of manufacturing warehousing processing assembling wholesaling specialty contractors and related establishments uses will have limited impacts on surrounding properties this district is particularly suited to areas having good access to highways and perhaps to rail li may serve as a buffer around the hi district and may be compatible with nearby residential zones or uses 8 hi  heavy industrial district the hi district is intended primarily for industrial uses and support activities that are potentially incompatible with most other uses and which are characterized by large amounts of traffic extensive shipping of goods outside storage or stockpiling of raw materials byproducts or finished goods and a controlled but higher level of noise andor pollution this district is located away from residential areas and has easy access to highways and perhaps to rail 703  special purpose districts special purpose districts are overlay districts that may be combined with a major zoning district the regulations of a special purpose district are supplementary to the regulations of the underlying major zoning district the regulations of a special purpose district and the major zoning district shall both apply to any site that has both designations where the regulations and permitted uses of a major zoning district conflict with those of a special purpose district the more restrictive

components  flood hazard mapping flood insurance and floodplain regulations the combination of the three all work together to reduce flood damages nfip is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating community local state and federal governments and private insurance companies must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the nfip the city of albany joined the nfip in 1985 the communitys role is of paramount importance residents and property owners can get federallybacked flood insurance only if the community carries out its responsibilities the community enacts and implements the floodplain regulations required for participation in nfip the communitys regulations must meet the regulations set by its state as well as the nfip criteria nonresidential for the purposes of development in the floodplain fema defines nonresidential construction to include structures not used for human habitation this includes parking limited storage and building access associated with residential uses as well as commercial industrial and institutional uses this differs from the definition of nonresidential in other articles and this from the definition in the locally adopted state building codes albany development  6  oregon drainage law oregon decisions has adopted a civil law doctrine of drainage generally under this doctrine adjoining landowners are entitled to have the normal course of natural drainage maintained the lower landowner must accept water that naturally comes to his land from above but he is entitled not to have the normal drainage changed or substantially increased the lower landowner may not obstruct the runoff from the upper land if the upper landowner is properly discharging the water the drainage law has developed without legislative action  therefore there are no oregon revised statutes rules or other laws to cite note that this definition is intended to provide general information and should not be used as the basis for legal advice or legal decisions permanent foundation a natural or manufactured support system to which a structure is anchored or attached a permanent foundation is capable of resisting flood forces and may include posts piles poured concrete or reinforced block walls properly compacted fill or other systems of comparable flood resistivity and

strict application of this section deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in vicinity and under identical zoning classifications variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the physical characteristics of the land and are not dependent upon the occupants type or use of a structure they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare 2910 no variance will be given to the standards for development in a floodway variances from the floodplain

increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances  and 4 the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 5 variances from the required lowest floor elevation for new construction and substantial improvements may be granted if the review body find that the request meets criteria 14 and the parcel is onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 6 variances may be granted for a water dependent use provided

watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria and otherwise complies with building codes upon issuing the variance the floodplain administrator will notify the applicant in writing that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance and that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property 2910  floodplain development permit required a floodplain development

statewide planning goal 5 and the provisions of the goal 5 administrative rule oar 660 division 23 while ensuring reasonable economic use of property more specifically the purpose and intent of each significant natural resource overlay district is as follows a riparian corridor overlay district rc to protect and enhance albanys riparian areas thereby protecting and restoring the hydrologic ecological and land conservation functions these areas provide significant riparian corridors support valuable fish and wildlife habitat  improve water quality by regulating stream temperatures trapping sediment and stabilizing streambanks  and reduce the effects of flooding a healthy riparian corridor is comprised of a multistoried forest of native species of trees shrubs and ground cover many riparian corridors in albany have the potential to be restored to higher function and value b significant wetland overlay district sw to protect and enhance the integrity function and value of albanys significant wetlands and fishbearing waterways wetlands and waterways provide hydrologic and ecologic functions  and reduce adverse effects of flooding the vast majority of significant wetlands are in riparian areas there are a small number of isolated significant wetlands the higher quality isolated wetlands will be regulated locally as identified in the citywide esee analysis  and the lower quality isolated wetlands will not be regulated locally but must comply with state and federal wetland regulations c habitat assessment overlay district ha to protect habitat for northwestern pond and western painted turtles in and around thornton lakes by reviewing and limiting the impacts of development activities on their habitat this was the only area in albany where there is a documented presence of a species listed by either the federal government or the state of oregon the state lists the species as sensitive critical the overlay identifies an area of high likelihood of turtle nesting foraging or migration routes the overlay district regulations provide a limited level of protection as identified in the thornton lakes esee analysis voluntary methods of turtle

development local mitigation is not required in addition to that required by odfw or other state and federal agencies 0121 albany development  26   mitigation standards mitigation is a way of compensating for adverse impacts to the functions and values of natural resources caused by development in many cases mitigation may result in resource area restoration or enhancement if a state or federal agency has jurisdiction regarding development impacts within the riparian corridor and significant wetland overlay districts and they require mitigation for those impacts the city will not impose additional mitigation requirements over the same area those portions of development impacts not mitigated state or federal agency will be subject to local mitigation requirements mitigation for impacts to turtle habitat in the habitat assessment overlay district will be solely managed by odfw the need for mitigation restoration or enhancement will be determined during the natural resource impact review process the director may allow some degree of flexibility to the standards based on the specific location and level of impact 1 when mitigation is required mitigation will be required under the following circumstances a removal of one or more native trees greater than 25 inches in circumference which requires replacement per section 2c b disturbance of more than 2000 square feet of vegetated surface area this level of impact will require a mitigation plan per  c when a request is made to develop or impact the riparian corridor overlay district area per b2b a mitigation plan will be required for enhancement of the remaining area per  2 local mitigation standards a onsite enhancement is required when the 50foot area of the riparian corridor overlay district is impacted per b2b unless the activity is otherwise exempted per this section of the b for other mitigation options onsite mitigation shall occur within the relevant significant resource overlay district as close to the impact area as reasonably feasible taking into consideration the existing natural and humanmade features of the site if onsite mitigation is not reasonably feasible offsite mitigation shall be

replanted tree shall be of a species that will eventually equal or exceed the removed tree in size if appropriate for the new location d mitigation for impacts shall require a mitigation area ratio of   however if the quality of the resource is enhanced or restored per 5 the ratio may be lowered with director approval e planting densities and species composition shall be consistent with native wetland and riparian area plant communities currently or historically found in the drainage basin use of a reference site as guidance for developing a revegetation plan is recommended f any mitigation requirements resulting from a proposed land division shall require a mitigation plan concurrent with the land division process  local mitigation plan when a local mitigation plan for impact to a

receiving satisfactory proof that the mitigation measures have been successfully implemented per 4 below if mitigation improvements fail during the 2year period the assurance shall both be forfeited and used by the city to correct the problem pursuant to the approved mitigation plan or the bond period may be extended for a 2year period with directors approval to allow for another replanting strategy when the city of albany or another unit of government is the applicant it must adhere to the standards in this section but an assurance is not required 4 a report on the survival and health of planted vegetation and the status of invasive species shall be performed by a qualified professional at the expense of the applicant and will be provided to the community development department between 18 and 24 months from the initial planting that describes the health of all vegetation and shows pictures of the vegetation the city may arrange an onsite inspection to verify information contained in the report if the survival rate for tree and shrub species is below 80% a replanting strategy shall be prepared approved and executed within 6 months of the report with a subsequent report on survival provided to the department between 12 and 18 months from the time of the second planting at this point if the survival rate is still below 80% the bond described in 3 will either be

such that its historic cultural or architectural character and significance is lost 2520 exterior alteration any physical changes to the exterior of an existing structure  generally excludes maintenance work such as painting and repairs historic contributing a building or structure originally constructed before 1946 that retains and exhibits sufficient integrity materials design and setting to convey a sense of history these properties strengthen the historic character of the district 1101 historic integrity a measure of authenticity of a propertys historic identity evidenced by the survival of physical characteristics that existed during the propertys historic or prehistoric period in comparison with its unaltered state  for example a historic building of high integrity has few alterations or ones that can be easily reversed historic noncontributing a building or structure originally constructed before 1946 that retains but does not exhibit sufficient historic features to convey a sense of history these properties do not strengthen the historic character of the district in their current condition 1101 albany development  2  landmark all designated historic buildings or structures on the local historic inventory are considered landmarks a landmark is either a historic contributing building site structure or object within a historic district is listed individually on the national register of historic places or is on the local historic inventory but located outside a historic district landmarks commission the landmarks commission conducts quasijudicial public

the designation of historic landmarks allows the city to formally recognize rate and protect its historic and architectural resources the local historic inventory identifies buildings sites structures objects and districts of historical importance or architectural significance that are considered exemplary of their time and style the regulation of designated and rated historic landmarks provides a means to review proposed changes and encourage the preservation of historical or architectural values periodically it may be necessary to rerate or remove the designation of a historic landmark to reflect changing conditions community values or needs 1300 2520  initiation the process for designating or removing a landmark or historic district may be initiated by the city council the landmarks commission or by any other interested person initiations by the landmarks commission are made without prejudice towards the outcome at the time of initiation the community development director shall provide the property owner and applicant with information regarding the benefits and obligations of designation no historic resource shall be designated as a landmark without the written consent of the owner or in the case of multiple ownership a majority of the owners removal of properties from the national register of historic places requires review and approval by the state historic preservation office and state advisory committee 1300 2520  procedure 1 designation requests for designations of historic landmarks and districts are reviewed type iv legislative or quasijudicial procedure the process is legislative when it affects a large number of persons or properties the landmarks commission replaces the planning commission as the initial review body the city council makes the final determination of historic designation 2 amendment to existing historic districts changes or additions to the period of significance statement property rating structure or boundaries of an existing historic district shall be reviewed under the type iv legislative process the landmarks commission replaces the planning commission as the initial review body the city council reviews and adopts any amendments to the historic districts 3 local historic inventory removal only landmarks outside the national register historic districts that are not listed on the national register of historic places individually are eligible for removal from the local historic inventory the director may delete any demolished or removed historic structure outside the historic districts from the local historic inventory type i procedure in the event a national register building or structure is demolished or moved an application shall be made to the state historic preservation office to remove

an alteration request 1101 albany development  8  1 the proposed alteration will cause the structure to more closely approximate the historical character appearance or material composition of the original structure than the existing structure or 2 the proposed alteration is compatible with the historic characteristics of the area and with the existing structure in massing size scale materials and architectural features the review criteria for the use of substitute siding windows and trim shall be as found in adc  1101 the review body will use the secretary of the interiors standards of rehabilitation listed below as guidelines in determining whether the proposed alteration meets the review criteria 1300  the secretary of the interiors standards for rehabilitation the following standards are to be applied to rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility 1 a property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment 2 the historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved the removal of historic material or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided 3 each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time place and use changes that create a false sense of historical development such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings shall not be undertaken 4 most properties change over time  those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved 5 distinctive features finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved 6 deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature the new feature shall match the old in design color texture and other visual qualities and where possible materials replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary physical or pictorial evidence 7 chemical or physical treatments such as sandblasting that cause damage to historic material shall not be used the surface cleaning of structures if appropriate shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible 8 significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved if such resources must be disturbed

certain uses these standards are intended to reduce adverse effects on surrounding property owners and the general public to create a business environment that is safe and comfortable to further energy conservation efforts within the city to enhance the environment for walking cycling and mass transit use and to ensure that highquality development is maintained throughout albany an applicant for a development that does not meet the design standards in may apply for one or more adjustments pursuant to adc  except that adjustments are not permitted to the standards in telecommunication facilities and supplemental design standards for the oak creek transition area 0121 the following list is a summary of the topics covered in this article  singlefamily homes  multiple family development  commercial and institutional site design  supplemental standards in village centers  telecommunications facilities  supplemental design standards for the oak creek transition area 1200 1313  914 by 0121 singlefamily homes  applicability 1 the standards of adc apply to all new singlefamily detached units manufactured homes twofamily units duplexes two detached primary units and singlefamily attached units on individual lots in all zones that allow singlefamily housing except as otherwise noted 1417  0121 2 in addition except as otherwise noted the standards of adc apply to multiplefamily units with individual driveways permitted pursuant to adc 2 that are located in the wf cb or dmu zone or in the hd zone in a building where groundfloor residential use is permitted pursuant to adc 17 1417  0121 3 these standards do not apply to detached accessory dwelling units existing structures new additions to existing structures or to manufactured home parks 1417  0121 4 development on flag lots or on lots that slope up or down from the street with an average slope of 20 percent or more is exempt from these standards 1200  1417  relationship to historic overlay districts for property inside the historic overlay districts and properties designated as historic landmarks the provisions in also apply for development subject to historic review under the review body may grant flexibility in meeting any of the design standards where necessary to achieve historic compatibility 1200  1417 albany development  2   home orientation the purpose of these standards is to create pedestrianfriendly sociable safe and attractive singlefamily neighborhoods scale design by ensuring that the pedestrian entrance is visible or clearly identifiable from the street these standards enhance public safety for residents and visitors and provide opportunities for community interaction 0121 1 at least one main entrance of each new home shall be within eight feet of the

percent of the area of the material is open 1200  0121 2 on sites with frontage on both a private street and a public street the standards apply to the site frontage on the public street on all other sites with more than one street frontage the applicant may decide on which frontage to meet the standards 0121 0121 3 in the dmu cb hd and wf zoning districts in order to provide a transition between public space the sidewalk and private space the home while maintaining a visual and physical connection to the street entrances to individual dwelling units must be set back at least five feet from the front lot line the entrance must be covered for a depth of at least three feet 1417 figure 1 front door facing the street figure 2 front door opening onto porch albany development  3   streetfacing windows the purpose of these standards is to create pedestrianfriendly sociable safe and attractive neighborhoods the standards enhance public safety by allowing people to survey their neighborhood from inside their residences  and also provide a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing large expanses of blank facades along streets 0121 1 at least 15 percent of the area of each faade that faces a street lot line must be windows or main pedestrian entrance doors 1417  0121 2 all windows on a streetfacing faade including windows in garage and pedestrian doors may be counted toward meeting this standard 0121 3 for a pedestrian door to count toward meeting this standard it must be the main entrance and face the street 1417 4 for a corner lot only one side of the unit must meet this standard 1200  1417  additional standards for infill and redevelopment the purpose of these standards are to preserve continuity in neighborhood appearance so that new homes fit in with the existing homes in the neighborhood in terms of features such as setbacks height and garages these standards only apply to proposals for infill development in residential zoning districts that allow singlefamily housing 1417  0121 1 definitions for the purposes of this section the following terms are defined a comparable dwelling means an existing detached singlefamily dwelling including manufactured dwellings an attached singlefamily dwelling or a duplex that is located on a comparable lot as defined below b comparable lot means a vacant or developed lot within a residential zoning district that allows detached singlefamily dwellings and that is not separated from the subject site by public rightofway vacant lots smaller than onefourth 14 the minimum lot size are not included within the definition of comparable lots c subject site means a property within a residential zoning district that allows detached singlefamily dwellings that is the site of a proposed new detached singlefamily dwelling including manufactured dwellings an attached singlefamily dwelling or a duplex subject sites include both vacant sites and those sites where a dwelling was or will be removed to allow for the new development sites larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone are not included within the definition of subject site 0121 2 determining whether a proposal is infill development to determine whether the proposed development on the subject site is infill development see example in figure 1 a identify the total number of comparable lots that abut the subject site ie share a common property line with the subject site including those that touch at the corners b identify the number of comparable lots abutting the subject site with comparable dwellings excluding those lots that are larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone c if the number of lots with comparable dwellings identified in subsection 2b is equal to or greater than 75 percent of the total number of comparable lots identified in subsection 2a then the proposal is infill development and subject to the standards of subsections 3 6 below 0121 albany development  4  0121 3 submittal requirements at the time of application for a building permit an applicant for infill development shall submit a vicinitysite plan that demonstrates how the proposed infill development on the subject site complies with standards in subsections 4 6 below the vicinitysite plan must show the following for comparable lots lot lines footprints of dwellings garages and carports and the direction buildings are facing setbacks from the street shall be noted building heights must also be noted for those comparable dwellings used to demonstrate compliance with the infill height requirements in standard 6 0121 4 minimum and maximum front setbacks the minimum and maximum front setbacks of an infill development are based on an evaluation of comparable dwellings that meet the following criteria see example figure 2  all or a portion of the comparable dwellings lot is within 150 feet of the subject site   the comparable dwellings lot has frontage on the same street as the subject site and is not a flag lot   the comparable dwellings lot is not larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone  and  the primary entrance of the comparable dwelling is oriented toward the same street as the proposed dwelling if only one comparable dwelling meets the above criteria the subject site is exempt from the infill setback standards in this subsection figure 2 infill development setbacks  identifying comparable dwellings example in this example minimum and maximum front setback on the subject site are determined based on comparable dwellings on  and 6 lot 1 is more than 150 feet from the subject site and the primary entrance of the dwelling on lot 7 is oriented to a different street  therefore the comparable dwellings on are not in the analysis figure 1 determining whether a proposal is infill development example in this example four out of five comparable lots that abut the subject site have comparable dwellings 4  5   80%  therefore the proposal in this example is infill development albany development  5  a infill development is subject to the minimum and maximum setback standards in table 1 see example in figure 3 notwithstanding the foregoing no development shall be located such that it violates minimum setback standards for the zoning district 0121 table 1 minimum and maximum setback standards for infill development proposed infill development minimum setback maximum setback dwelling no more than 5 feet closer to the front property line than the closest comparable dwelling on a comparable lot meeting the criteria in 4 no more than 5 feet farther from the front property line than the farthest comparable dwelling on a comparable lot meeting the criteria in 4 garage or carport no more than 5 feet closer to the front property line than the closest garage or carport of a comparable dwelling on a comparable lot meeting the criteria in 4 none 0121 0121 figure 3 infill development setbacks applying the setback standards example minimum setback  dwelling of the comparable dwellings on  and 6 the dwelling on lot 4 is the closest to its front property line  therefore a dwelling on the subject site can be no closer to its front property line than five feet closer than the dwelling on lot 4 while still meeting the minimum setbacks for the zone maximum setback  dwelling of the dwellings on  and 6 the dwelling on lot 2 is the farthest from its front property line  therefore a dwelling on the subject site can be no farther from its front property line than five feet farther than the dwelling on lot 2 while still meeting the minimum setbacks for the zone albany development  6  5 required garage or carport infill development may be required to have a garage or carport based on elevation of comparable dwellings that meet the following criteria see example in figure 4  all or a portion of the comparable dwellings lot is within 150 feet of the subject site   the comparable dwellings lot has frontage on the same street  and  the comparable dwellings lot is not larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone if only one comparable dwelling meets the above criteria the subject site is exempt from the infill garage and carport standards in this subsection 0121 a a proposed infill development requires a garage or carport as specified in table 2 see example in figure 5 0121 table 2 infill garage and carport requirements 0121 b the garage or carport may be attached or detached from the dwelling c the garage or carports exterior walls and roof shall not be constructed of the following materials polyethylene plastic or vinyl except vinyl residential siding fabric untreated wood except cedar or redwood corrugated metal or sheet metal figure 4 infill development garage  carport requirements  identifying comparable lots example in this example garage  carport requirements for the subject site are determined based on an analysis of  5 and 6 are more than 150 feet from the subject site  therefore these lots are not included in the analysis if more than 50 percent of the comparable dwellings on comparable lots meeting the criteria in subsection 5 proposed infill development requires i have a garage a garage ii have a carport a carport or garage iii have either a carport or a garage a carport or garage provided that if i is true a garage is required albany development  7  0121 0121 6 maximum building height the maximum building height of an infill development is based on an evaluation of comparable dwellings on comparable lots that meet the following criteria  the comparable dwellings lot is abutting the subject site   the comparable dwellings lot has frontage on the same street  and  the comparable dwellings lot is not larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone if only one comparable dwelling meets the above criteria the subject site is exempt from the infill height standards in this subsection see example in figure 6 a maximum building height a proposed dwelling on the subject site shall be no more than one story higher above ground than the lowest comparable dwelling that meets the criteria in subsection 6 b notwithstanding the foregoing no development shall be constructed such that it violates height standards for the zoning district 0121 figure 5 infill development  applying the garage  carport requirements example in this example there are 4 comparable lots that meet the criteria in subsection 5 of the 4 lots  2 dwellings have garages 50%  1 dwelling has a carport 25%  3 dwellings have either a carport or a garage 75% because more than 50% of the dwellings on comparable lots have a garage or carport and more than 50% are not garages the infill development on the subject site must have either a carport or a garage albany development  8  figure 6 infill development height requirement example in this example maximum building height requirements for the subject site are determined based on an analysis of the dwellings on  the dwelling on lot 1 is two stories and the dwelling on lot 2 is one story therefore the proposed infill development on the subject site can be a maximum of two stories ie one story higher above ground than the lowest dwelling 0121 7 home orientation the main entrance of each home shall comply with home orientation standards in 8 streetfacing windows the streetfacing faade of each home shall comply with the window standards in 1200  0121  parking and access in the dmu cb hd and wf zoning districts these standards are intended to support a pedestrianfriendly street environment by minimizing the visual and safety impacts of driveways parking and garages  and to preserve onstreet parking see for additional access standards 1417 1 driveway standards a development sites abutting an alley vehicle access shall be via the alley rather than the public street 1417 b development sites that do not abut an alley vehicle access shall meet i or ii below i provide vehicle access from not more than one driveway to each public street abutting the development site 1417 ii provide vehicle access to properties within the development site from shared or paired driveways with a minimum spacing between driveways of 25 feet see figure 1 the distance between driveways is measured along the front property line 1417  0121 albany development  9  figure 1

sidewalks  street trees  bikeways  utilitiesgeneral  water  sanitary sewer  storm drainage  improvement assurances  addresses and street names 2707 general provisions  authority the city has jurisdiction and exercises regulatory management over all city rightofway franchise utility use of rightofway city utilities and easements benefiting the city of albany for provision of utility and transportation services the city is both a service provider and property ownermanager these responsibilities require decisions to be made in a way that protects the public health safety and welfare  and provides for efficient extensions of services rightofway under state or county jurisdiction is also located within the city limits in those instances the standards in still apply  however the city may deviate from the standards provided herein as necessary to comply with each agencys requirements 1 as a property owner and service provider the city has sole discretion over all aspects of managing its utilities rightsofway and related easements this includes but is not limited to access and connection requirements  construction modification or alteration of public infrastructure  franchise utility requirements required extensions of service  and frontage improvements 2 the standards in are one mechanism used by the city as a landowner and service provider to regulate access and connection to public rightsofway easements transportation systems and utilities including required extensions of services and frontage improvements with development applying these standards requires discretion and professional judgement for the protection of public health safety and welfare and for overall efficient provision of urban services these standards are not subject to the limitations of ors 4 0121  relationship to other local regulations this article supplements other municipal ordinances if a provision of this article conflicts with another city ordinance the ordinance that most specifically deals with the issue in question shall control whenever possible the two provisions shall be interpreted in a manner that renders the provisions of both ordinances consistent only when such interpretation is impossible will one provision be deemed to supersede the other  relationship to specialty codes or state law this article supplements other existing state and local codes examples of these codes include but are not limited to the adopted building fire and plumbing codes if any provision of this article conflicts with a specialty code the specialty code shall control albany development  2   conditions of approval development approval may be conditioned upon the provision andor guarantee of public improvements called for in an adopted public facilities master plan or any other public improvements necessitated by the development development approval may likewise be conditioned when private facilities are proposed to be shared by two or

signage the following is a list of the main headings in this article  general provisions  general sign regulations  exemptions  temporary signs or displays  permanent signs  review procedures  variances  nonconforming signs  definitions general provisions  purpose 1 while signs communicate all types of helpful information unregulated signs obstruct views distract motorists displace alternative uses for land and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation the purpose of this article is to regulate the size illumination movement materials location height and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation thus ensuring the protection of property values  the character of the various neighborhoods  the creation of a convenient attractive and harmonious community  protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development this article allows adequate communication while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design location size and purpose of all signs this article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the first amendment guarantee of free speech if any provision of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision 2 a sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building therefore the intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs to ensure they are appropriate to the land building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in subsection 1 of this section 3 these regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain are not distracting to motorists and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition 4 these regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the city rather they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above 5 these regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs rather they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs 1 entire

content in this article  use categories     definitions   natural resource definitions  use categories use categories in added by 703  introduction to the use categories this section classifies land uses and activities into use categories based on common functional product or physical characteristics the use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future uses to zones the decision to allow or prohibit the use categories in the various zones is based on the zoning district purpose statements the schedules of permitted uses by zoning district special conditions and the development standards are located in residential zoning districts  commercial and industrial zoning districts  and mixed use village center zoning districts the environmental performance standards in onsite development and environmental standards may limit the placement of certain uses in some zoning districts industrial use categories  contractors and industrial services  manufacturing and production  smallscale manufacturing  railroad yards  warehousing and distribution  waste and recycling related  wholesale sales commercial use categories  adult entertainment  entertainment and

primary use each use category is described and defined developments may have more than one primary use developments may also have one or more accessory uses the following are considered in determining what category the use is in and whether the activities constitute primary uses or accessory uses  the description of the activityies in relationship to the characteristics of each use category   the relative amount of site or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity   relative amounts of sales from each activity   the customer type for each activity   the relative number of employees in each activity   hours of operation   building and site arrangement   vehicles used with the activity   the relative number of vehicle trips generated by the activity   signs   how the use advertises itself  and  whether the activity would be likely to be found independent of other activities on the site 2 developments with multiple primary uses when all of the primary uses of a development fall into one use category the development is assigned to that use category for example a development that contains a retail bakery and a caf would be classified in the retail sales and service category because all of the primary uses are in that category when the primary uses of a development fall into different use categories each primary use is classified in the applicable category and is subject
