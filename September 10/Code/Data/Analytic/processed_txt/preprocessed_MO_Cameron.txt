storage volume in a reservoir stagedischarge curve a stagedischarge curve defines the relationship between the depth of water and the discharge or outflow from a storage facility the stagedischarge curve should take into account the discharge characteristics of both the principal and emergency spillways general procedure step 1 compute inflow hydrograph for runoff from the fifty 50 percent ten 10 percent and one 1 percent design storms both pre and postdevelopment hydrographs are required for the fifty 50 percent and ten 10 percent design storms only the postdevelopment hydrograph is required for runoff from the one 1 percent design storm step 2 perform preliminary calculations to evaluate detention storage requirements for the hydrographs from step 1 if storage requirements are satisfied for runoff from the fifty 50 percent and ten 10 percent design storms runoff from intermediate storms is assumed to be controlled step 3 determine the physical dimensions necessary to hold the estimated volume from step 2 including freeboard the maximum storage requirement calculated from step 2 should be used from the selected shape determine the maximum depth in the pond step 4 select the type of outlet and size the outlet structure the estimated peak stage will occur for the estimated volume from step 2 the outlet structure should be sized to convey the allowable discharge at this stage step 5 perform routing calculations using inflow hydrograph from step 1 to check the preliminary design using the storage routing equations if the routed postdevelopment peak discharges from the fifty 50 percent and ten 10 percent design storms exceed the predevelopment peak discharges or if the peak stage varies significantly from the estimated peak stage from step 4 then revise the estimated volume and return to step 3 step 6 consider emergency overflow from runoff due to the one 1 percent design storm and established freeboard requirements step 7 if necessary evaluate the downstream effects of detention outflow to ensure that the routed hydrograph does not cause downstream flooding problems the exit hydrograph from the storage facility may need to be routed downstream channel system to the confluence point to where the drainage area being analyzed represents ten 10 percent of the total drainage area step 8 evaluate the control structure outlet velocity and provide channel bank stabilization if the velocity will cause erosion problems downstream the ten 10 percent storm volume will determine the size of the pond while the fifty 50 percent storm peak control need will determine the size of a minimum outlet structure thus the pond is sized for the ten 10 percent storm then the fifty 50 percent storm is routed pond and the fifty 50 percent outlet structure is sized f required information for plan and profile sheets supersedes 1 calculate and label the total disturbed area and clearly identify all areas within the site which will be included in the land

variance to the requirements of this be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the governing body for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance if the governing body does not respond to the application within 15 days after receipt the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application e obstruction marking and
