inlet to trap solids or debris debris any rock dirt sand tree or other rubbish litter etc detention basin or retention basin a depression or bermed area designed with an inlet and outlet that regulates water flow and may allow debris to settle out of the water and that is capable of detaining storm water runoff until it can either percolate into the surrounding soil or be discharged at an approved release rate into a channel pipe ditch street or other conveyance without causing damage downstream the detention basin shall have a discharge into said facilities as set forth above however a retention basin must contain all generated volumes drain inlet a point of entry into a sump detention or retention basin or storm water system or conduit or approved irrigation system low impact development lid storm water control measures intended to capture infiltrate or treat initial runoff storm drain a closed conduit for conducting storm water that has been collected by inlets or other approved means storm water precipitation such as rain snow hail or other naturally occurring waters that are not present as groundwater once the water percolates into the soil it is defined herein as groundwater storm water runoff is water that is generated by storm water over land all other water is defined as being water that is naturally occurring and is not storm water sump a formalized structure underground surrounded by drain rock that acts as a detention basin to allow the slow release of water into the surrounding subsoil sumps usually receive storm water runoff from paved areas such as streets parking lots building roofs etc  865 reduction of storm water flows a the development for which the permit or approval is issued must design for and calculate the flows and volume as provided in subsection 1174d of this code that will be produced by a 10year 24hour storm for detained flow and storage and a 25year 24hour storm for retained flow and storage in addition the maximum allowable discharge from the entire project area or site shall not exceed 015 cfs per acre of gross area of development the amount of storm water exiting the project cannot exceed the amount calculated above but may be further restricted by the capacity of existing storm drains or drainage facilities as determined by the city engineer restrictions to the controlled rate of release will require that detention storage be provided if no storm water collection irrigation system with allowable capacity or detention basins downstream are available with sufficient unused capacity for the 10 year storm volume or any portion thereof retention of the 25year storm must be provided in any event that retention is the only available source of storm water management in the determination of

chapter are not intended to and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or to have the effect of prohibiting the furnishing of personal wireless services nor shall the provisions of this chapter be applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services to the extent that any provision or provisions of this chapter are inconsistent or in conflict with any other provision of this code or any ordinance of the city the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed to control bin the course of reviewing a request for any approval required under this chapter made by an applicant to provide personal wireless service or to install personal wireless service facilities the planning commission or the city council as the case may be shall act within a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed with the city taking into account the nature and scope of the request and any decision to deny a request shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record cshould the application of this chapter have the effect of prohibiting a person or entity from providing personal wireless service to all or a portion of the city such provider may petition the city council for an amendment to this chapter the city council upon receipt of such a petition shall promptly undertake review of the petition and shall make a determination on the petition within a reasonable period of time taking into account the nature and scope of the petition and any decision to deny such petition shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record  3172 definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them below antenna any exterior apparatus designed for telephonic radio or television communications sending andor receiving of electromagnetic waves including equipment attached to a tower or building for the purpose of providing personal wireless services antenna height the vertical distance measured from the base of the antenna support structure at grade to the highest point of the structure even if said highest point is an antenna measurement of tower height shall include antenna base pad and other appurtenances and shall be measured from the finished grade of the parcel if the support structure is on a sloped grade then the average between the highest and lowest grades shall be used in calculating the antenna height antenna support structure any pole telescoping mast tower tripod or other structure which supports an antenna cell site a tract or parcel of land that contains the cellular communications or personal wireless services antenna its support structure accessory buildings and parking and may include other uses associated with and ancillary to cellular communications or personal wireless services transmission faa the federal aviation administration fcc the federal communications commission governing authority the governing authority of the city namely the city council personal wireless service and personal wireless service facilities as used in this chapter shall be defined in the same manner as in united states section 332c7c as may be amended now or in the future tower any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas including selfsupporting lattice towers guy towers or multiple towers the term encompasses personal wireless facilities including radio and television transmission towers microwave towers common carrier towers cellular telephone towers or personal communications service towers alternative tower structures and the like tower stealth any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for the purpose of supporting one or more antennas in a manner that shall be camouflaged and constructed in a manner to avoid detection as a cell tower ie flagpole tree etc  3173 policy statement the planning commission and city council have on numerous occasions and with increasing frequency been confronted with requests to site communications towers and antennas the purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas the goals of this chapter are to a encourage the location of towers on public property and in nonresidential areas and to minimize the total number of towers throughout the city  b encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites  c encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal  d encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas  and e enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services throughout the city quickly effectively and efficiently accordingly the city council finds that the promulgation of this chapter is warranted and necessary to amanage the location of towers and antennas in the city and encourage the use of public property for the placement thereof  bprotect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers including support structure failure and falling ice  cminimize adverse visual impacts of towers design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  daccommodate the growing need for towers  epromote and encourage shared usecollocation of existing and new towers as a primary option rather than construction of additional single use towers and to reduce the number of such structures needed in the future  fconsider the public health and safety of towers to the extent allowed by the telecommunications act of 1996  and gavoid potential damage to adjacent properties from antenna support structure failure and falling ice proper siting of antenna support structures  3174 license required it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in any business of personal wireless telecommunications facilities within the corporate limits of the city without first obtaining a business license 2003  3175 where permitted cell towers are a permitted use in any zone on city owned property and are permitted as a conditional use in other zones on property owned by any other entity  3176 existing towers all towers existing on the date of passage of the ordinance codified herein shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist routine maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers new construction other than routine maintenance on existing towers shall comply with the requirements of this chapter  3177 industry site selection criteria in selecting a new site the industry requires a location that is technically compatible with the established network a general area is to be identified based upon engineering constraints and the desired area of service specific locations within that general area will be evaluated using the following criteria which are not listed in order of priority atopography as it relates to line of sight transmissions for optimum efficiency in telephone service bavailability of road access cavailability of electric power davailability of land based telephone lines or microwave link capability eleasable lands and landlords who want facilities to be located on their properties consistent with zoning regulations fscreening potential of existing vegetation structures and topographic features gzoning that will allow low power mobile radio service facilities hcompatibility with adjacent land users ithe least number of sites to cover the desired area jthe greatest amount of coverage consistent with physical requirements kopportunities to mitigate possible visual impact lavailability of suitable existing structures for antenna mounting  3178 city site selection criteria ascope as a fundamental element of this chapter the telecommunications company proposing to construct an antenna support structure or mount an antenna on an existing structure is required to demonstrate using technological evidence that the antenna must go where it is proposed in order to satisfy its function in the companys grid system further the company must demonstrate by technological evidence that the height requested is the minimum height necessary to fulfill the cell sites function within the grid system bfcc provider or agreements applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the applicant demonstrates that it is either an fcc licensed telecommunications provider or has in place agreements with an fcc licensed telecommunications provider for use or lease of the support structure cminimization of adverse effect low power mobile radio service facilities should be located and designed to minimize any adverse effects that they may have on residential property values sites should be placed in locations where the existing topography vegetation buildings or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening dimpact on neighborhood  minimum lot size location and design of sites in all districts should consider the impact of the site on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual impact within the zone district in residential districts and residential land use areas the minimum lot size for commercial communications towers on nonpublic land shall be three 3 acres  3179 priorities aorder specified the following establishes the order of priorities for locating new communications facilities 1place antennas and towers on city property in nonresidential zones 2place antennas and towers on city property in the residential zones 3place antennas on appropriate existing structures such as buildings communications towers water towers and smokestacks in other zoned districts 4place antennas and towers on other private nonresidential property 5place antennas and stealth towers a only in other residential districts only if locations for which a need has been demonstrated are not available on existing structures or in nonresidential districts  and b only on or in existing churches parks schools utility facilities or other public facilities blocation considerations an applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located in a residential zoning district shall demonstrate that a diligent effort has been made to locate the proposed communications facilities on a government structure a private institutional structure or other appropriate existing structures within a nonresidential zoning district and that due to valid considerations including physical constraints and economic or technological feasibility no appropriate location is available the telecommunications company is required to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures within a one mile radius of the site proposed asked for permission to install the antenna on those structures and was denied for reasons other than economic ones the information submitted by the applicant shall include a map of the area to be served by the tower its relationship to other antenna sites in the applicants network and an evaluation of existing buildings taller than twenty feet 20 communications towers and water tanks within one mile of the proposed tower cpriority of users priority for the use of city owned land for antennas and towers will be given to the following entities in descending order 1the city  2public safety agencies including law enforcement fire and ambulance services which are not part of the city and private entities with a public safety agreement with the city  3other governmental agencies for uses which are not related to public safety  and 4entities providing licensed commercial wireless telecommunication services including cellular personal communication services pcs specialized mobilized radio smr enhanced specialized mobilized radio esmr paging and similar services marketed to the general public  31710 minimum and special requirements aminimum requirements the placement of antennas or towers on city owned property must comply with the following requirements 1the antennas or tower will not interfere with the purpose for which the city owned property is intended 2the city council must find that the antennas or tower will have no significant adverse impact on surrounding private property 3the applicant is willing to obtain adequate liability insurance and commit to a lease agreement which includes equitable compensation for the use of public land and other necessary provisions and safeguards the fees shall be established by the city council after considering comparable rates in other cities potential expenses risks to the city and other appropriate factors  4the applicant will submit a letter of credit performance bond or other security acceptable to the city to cover the costs of the antennas or towers removal  5the antenna or tower will not interfere with other users who have a higher priority as discussed in subsection 3179c of this chapter  6upon reasonable notice the antenna or tower may be required to be removed at the users expense  7the applicantuser must reimburse the city for any costs which it incurs because of the presence of the applicants or users antenna or tower  8the user must obtain all necessary land use approvals  and 9the applicant will cooperate with the citys objective to promote collocations and thus limit the number of separate antenna sites requested bspecial requirements the use of certain city owned property such as water tower sites and parks for antennas or towers brings with it special concerns due to the unique nature of these sites the placement of antennas or towers on these special city owned sites will be allowed only when the following additional requirements are met 1water tower or reservoir sites the citys water towers and reservoirs represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak capacity reserves protection of the quality of the citys water supply is of prime importance to the city as access to the citys water storage systems increases so too increases the potential for contamination of the public water supply for these reasons the placement of antennas or towers on water tower or reservoir sites will be allowed only when the city is fully satisfied that the following requirements are met athe applicants access to the facility will not increase the risks of contamination to the citys water supply  bthere is sufficient room on the structure andor on the grounds to accommodate the applicants facility  cthe presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or reservoir maintenance cost to the city  and dthe presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health of workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir 2parks the presence of certain antennas or towers represents a potential conflict with the purpose of some city owned parks in no case shall towers be allowed in designated conservation areas unless they are to be installed in areas which currently contain tower facilities antennas or towers will be considered only after approval of the city council the following criteria will be considered in the priority listed below apublic parks of a sufficient scale and character to accommodate a cell tower site  bcommercial recreation areas and major play fields  and cpark maintenance facilities  31711 application process all applicants who wish to locate an antenna or tower on city owned property must submit to the community development department a completed application and detailed plan that complies with the submittal requirements of this chapter the zoning ordinance subdivision ordinance general plan and other regulations and ordinances of the city along with other pertinent information requested by the city all completed applications shall be submitted to the city council for their consideration  31712 termination of lease aconditions the city council may terminate any lease if it determines that any one of the following conditions exist 1a potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use  2a users frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users of higher priority regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately predicted in the technical analysis  or 3a user violates any of the standards in this chapter or the conditions attached to the citys lease or other authorization bnotice requirements before taking action the city will provide notice to the user of the intended termination and the reasons for it and provide an opportunity for the user to address the city council regarding the proposed action this procedure need not be followed in emergency situations  31713 reservation of right notwithstanding the above the city council reserves the right to deny for any reason the use of any or all city owned property by any one or all applicants  31714 collocation  use of public property to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers collocation of antennas by more than one carrier on existing or new towers and location of such antennas on public property shall take precedent over the construction of new single use towers as follows aconsiderations proposed antenna may and are encouraged to collocate onto existing towers provided such collocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the policy site criteria and landscapescreening provisions contained in this chapter then such collocations are permitted by right and new or additional conditional use approval is not required except that any other permit license lease or franchise requirements must be satisfied bwaiver of conditional use requirement any conditional use requirement for an antenna may be waived in nonresidential zones if the applicant locates the antenna on an existing structure other than an existing tower andor if the antenna is proposed to be located on suitable public property such as a water tower government building or other public tower or pole suitability of public property shall be determined in the citys sole discretion the applicant must submit detailed plans to the planning department for an administrative review to determine compliance with this chapter and the applicable zoning ordinances no building permit will be issued until approval is granted administrative review cdenial the city may deny the application to construct a new tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an existing structure andor public property ddesign to accommodate additional antenna in order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the city in the future any new proposed support structure shall be designed to accommodate antennas for more than one user unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic technical or physical reasons eprovide additional space unless collocation has been demonstrated to be infeasible the site plan shall delineate an area near the base of the tower to be used for the placement of additional equipment buildings for other users the site plan for towers in excess of eighty feet 80 must propose space for three 3 comparable tower users while the site plan for towers under eighty feet 80 must propose space for one comparable tower user to provide further incentive for collocation as a primary option an existing tower may be modified or reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna provided the additional antenna shall be of the same type as that on the existing tower this is permitted by right for existing towers in all zoning districts subject to the following criteria being met 1additional height an existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height not to exceed twenty feet 20 over the towers existing height to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna the height change may occur only once per tower 2one tower per site a tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the collocation of an additional antenna may be moved on site within fifty feet 50 of its existing location so long as it remains within the same zone and complies with the other provisions of this chapter after the tower is rebuilt to accommodate collocation only one tower may remain on site  31715 design criteria amultiple users as provided above new tower sites shall be designed to accommodate antenna for more than one user unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic technical or physical reasons bcompatibility facilities should be architecturally compatible with the surrounding buildings and land

which advises the council on zoning matters have determined that the various aspects of architectural design have significant impact on the character and value of the city neighborhoods and business districts and that preserving and enhancing this character requires the existence of a certain harmony and compatibility in these aspects from one building or dwelling to the next and throughout the particular neighborhood or district they have also determined that preserving and enhancing the visual character of certain entryways to the city and areas of unique historical or architectural significance furthers the economic and cultural wellbeing of the community additionally the city finds that these same benefits should be extended to the entire city the design standards outlined below address general design relationships and site planning principles they are standards that could apply to any area of the city aconstruction activity the planning commission will review different kinds of construction activity that need design approval  and each kind will need a slightly different application of the guidelines 1for the construction of new buildings including residences and parts of buildings the focus is on the compatibility of new construction with the existing character style size etc of the immediate area 2for reconstruction remodeling addition and repair of existing structures this rehabilitation will be done in line with the original character of the structure 3for relocation of buildings those buildings moved to sites must be compatible with the surrounding buildings 4for the demolition or removal of all or parts of existing buildings compatible replacement structures must be sought 5for sign permits the sign is to be designed as an integral

immediate area to protect the visual pattern of the community to protect the value of surrounding properties and to promote harmony in the visual relationships and transitions between new and older buildings new buildings including residences should be made sympathetic to scale form size and proportion of existing buildings this can be done by repeating building lines and surface treatment and

enhanced by providing adequate lighting and landscaping that allow for unobstructed views 13territoriality should be augmented by the use of sidewalks landscaping porches and other elements that establish the boundaries between public semiprivate and private areas 14projects should be designed with human scale foremost 15to promote quality design stabilize and improve property values and

101533 stormwater management basins adefinitions a stormwater management basin is alternately termed detention basin retention basin debris basin or containment basin largely depending upon the basins basic use and upon local preference in general any such basin assists in the management of stormwater by holding stormwater during times of high runoff rate and then either holding the water until it subsides or metering the water out of the basin into a stormwater system at a manageable reduced flow rate the basins prevent or at least mitigate flooding conditions in the city as a whole or in a given neighborhood or industrial commercial or residential development bdetermination of basin parameters 1the city engineer will determine or certify the design parameters of each stormwater management basin based upon its capability to provide fill retention of stormwater runoff within a closed basin having a capability to hold one hundred percent 100% of all street and yard runoff from a 5year 24hour storm event with a retained water depth equal to or less than six inches 6 and upon the geotechnical study required when new or modified impervious surface conditions change primarily because of new industrial commercial or residential development 2design parameters will include the basin total area including terms and other details of the basin basin depth basin holding capacity and required basin discharge rate if any 3the developer will provide a drainage plan which specifically defines all surface and underground elements and which shows grading details of all applicable areas the plan will identify all paved and unpaved areas and will specify the flow routing to demonstrate that all runoff will be collected to the project basins 4the basin shall be designed with a means of gravity evacuation to facilitate its availability as a recreation area 5see title 8 chapter 6 of this code cresponsibility for basin implementation all aspects of basin implementation including provision of the land the basin will require the geotechnical study and report the basin design for certification by the city engineer basin construction following design approval including all stormwater collection and discharge conduits and basin landscaping is the responsibility of the developer in the case of a new industrial commercial or residential development if the basin is to serve the city in general as in the case of a large debris basin the responsibility is that of the city dbasin ownership and continued maintenance responsibility 1basin serving the city  such basins normally several acres and over ten feet 10 in depth are public property and are maintained by the city 2basin serving a specific residential commercial or industrial development abasins having a total area over one acre will be brought to completion standards by the developer and upon the final acceptance of the basin area by the city the basin will be deeded to the city by the developer the city then assumes continued maintenance responsibility see subsection c of this section the basin depending upon its configuration may be used by the city as a playground or recreation area bbasins having a total area of less than one acre will be brought to completion standards by the developer and its disposition for ownership and continued maintenance can then be in one of the following methods 1the developer can sell the basin area to a single adjoining property owner the developer must place written conditions on the buyer a copy to be filed with the city engineer that include the following nothing temporary or permanent can be built stored erected located or parked in the basin only grass or another suitable ground cover can be included in the basins landscaping ie no trees or shrubbery the basin area may at the owners discretion be used as a playground or to play sports that the basins area would allow 2the developer can offer the basin to the city who will determine its residual value to the city versus cost of maintenance if the city determines to accept the basin it will be deeded to the city at no cost 3the developer can deed the basin to a neighborhood homeowners association particularly in the case of a pd where such an association is required in this case the same conditions cited in subsection d2b1 of this section must be imposed upon the association with a copy of the written conditions being filed with the city engineer 3for various technical reasons the city engineer may determine a given basin of any size must be owned and maintained by the city
