minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage     85536 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may

of this article att a sec xii adopted  secs  reserved division 3 water conservation plan a the city water department served approximately 4000 residents in 1999 and is expecting no major increase in population over the next 5 years the water department served approximately 1600 connections in 1999 the service area is currently served by a 15 million gallons per day cityowned well system the water department also has an emergency water connection with the city of fort worth in case of an emergency however it is the responsibility of the water department to examine and control our main source of supply so as to avoid any necessity to obtain water from an emergency source therefore it is necessary to examine water use practices and educate the public about ways in which to reduce overall water use it is also necessary to set goals and outline methodologies in which to achieve these goals b this water conservation plan identifies water conservation goals and identifies and explains conservation practices that will help protect longterm water supplies for the city and its customers this plan includes information required by the state commission on environmental quality tceq for water conservation plans as well as information specific to the city water supply and treatment system att b sec i adopted  overview    352536 the city conservation plan recognizes that the city is under a contract with the city of fort worth for an emergency connection and that in case of any emergency that arises in the fort worth water system will cause the same rationing and conservation methods as stated in that contract to be placed upon the residents of sansom park att b sec 2 adopted  conservation goals a the average purchased water supply for the year 1999 was 145 million gallons and the amount of water sold was 144 million gallons which means that the city had approximately 1 million gallons or 1 percent of unaccounted water loss for that year the water department serviced 1469 connections for that period for an average consumption of 99214 gallons per connection per year or 8268 gallons per connection per month since the city has begun a water line replacement program and a meter changeout program the unaccounted water loss has greatly improved over the last 10 years also the city has begun enforcing the international plumbing which requires watersaving fixtures future goals will center around public awareness on the conservative use of water emphasis will be placed on the control of outside watering especially during the hotter months more conservation steps will be directed toward the conservation of water usage because during drought times the level of water in the lake drops dramatically and will eventually lead to more stringent control in order to maintain enough water to meet the water systems demand public awareness will include information contained on the web page brochures and periodic presentations by staff representatives at local meeting places within the city b the new goals for the city are as follows 1 continue water line and meter changeout programs 2 continue meter calibration programs at the water plant 3 public education 4 reduce peak demands att b sec 3 adopted  conservation methods a the city water conservation plan includes the following water conservation methods 1 public information and education 2 plumbing code 3 meter testing and upgrades 4 old and deteriorated water line replacement 5 leak detection and repair 6 water conserving landscaping 7 water use auditing 8 certificate of occupancy inspections each method is presented and described in the following subsections    353536 b public information and education the most important part of the citys conservation program is public education the city staff will present information upon request to the public 1 presentations at community meetings the staff will present conservation updates in order to educate the public 2 cable access notifications the water department uses the public access channel channel 3 when possible to notify the public of any special meeting or event in the area of water conservation 3 school programs the city staff will make presentations on water conservation to the schools upon request c plumbing code the city will adopt the 1997 international plumbing d meter testing and upgrades the meters at the plant are calibrated now semiannually and the city will continue to replace any dead meters in the system e water line replacement program the city has implemented a program of replacing old and deteriorated water mains and the program will continue until all the old mains have been replaced f leak detection and repair all water main leaks are monitored closely and repaired as soon as possible the city representatives will notify the residents of any possible leak that they have on their side use of leak detection systems installed on most meters upon request g waterconserving landscaping the water department encourages the planting of water efficient ideas species the city staff will be happy to assist any resident with questions on this type of program if necessary the staff will direct the resident to a local nursery where they can find more information h water use auditing the utility billing manager will monitor the bills on a monthly basis and report any abnormalities to the distribution department for further investigation the city annually compares water purchased against water sold and reports this information to the state water development board i certificate of occupancy inspections all vacant housing must make application and obtain a certificate of occupancy certificate prior to occupying the house during this inspection it will be required that any plumbing fixtures will have to comply with the state code for the installation of watersaving fixtures j landscape watering schedule though not required on a daily basis a 5day watering schedule will be available upon request at the city hall it is recommended that residents abstain from watering during peak water demand times and to control the length of watering to no more than 30 minutes or to the point of runoff in any one area for example place a small sized tuna can in the area that is being watered  when the can fills up with water the area is adequately watered att b sec 4 adopted  with other agencies this plan will be presented to the region c water planning group and also the tarrant water district no 1 as the supplier att b sec 5 adopted  system operations tarrant regional water district no 1 as the citys raw water supplier is responsible for operations of the reservoir system as described in the summary section of this plan tarrant regional water district
