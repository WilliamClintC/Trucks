special flood hazard areas of the city of richmond heights missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be ordinance of purpose       expected to have a onepercent chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for st louis county dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2 calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3 computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5 delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood a it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in b  to establish or maintain the communitys

development of cable systems has the potential to be of great benefit to the city and its residents and businesses cable technology is rapidly changing and cable plays an essential role as part of the citys basic infrastructure cable systems extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rightofways in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them and in a manner reserved primarily for those who provide services to the public such as utility companies a cable company currently typically faces very limited competition  thus the grant of a franchise has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic benefits and places the holder in a position of public trust because of these facts the city finds that public convenience safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the city or such persons as the city so designates to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest in light of the foregoing the following goals among others underlie the provisions set forth in this cable service should be available to as many city residents and businesses as possible and provide the widest possible diversity of information sources and services to the public 2 a cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cablerelated needs of the community 3 a cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum extent possible into existing system facilities taking into account all relevant factors including costs 4 a cable system should grow and develop and be responsive to the needs and interests of the community the city intends that all provisions set forth in this construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes and that any franchise issued pursuant to this construed to include the foregoing findings and
