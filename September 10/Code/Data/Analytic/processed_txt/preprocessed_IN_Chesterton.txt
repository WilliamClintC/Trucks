9282015  92 findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental sendees extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages passed 9282015  93 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and fmake flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the town by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program passed 9282015  94 objectives the objectives of this chapter are ato protect human life and health  bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dto minimize prolonged business interruptions  eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas main electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  and fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas passed 9282015  95 definitions for the purpose of this
