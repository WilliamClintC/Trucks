finds that the potential andor actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the residents of the city of kingston and that such damages may include destruction or loss of private and public housing damage to public facilities both publicly and privately owned and injury to and loss of human life in order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth this section is adopted  40525 kingston city code  40526  b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this section to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 regulate uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damages  5 regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and 6 qualify for and maintain participation in the national flood insurance program c objectives the objectives of this section are to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7 provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume

intentionally reduced in the rfr zone waterfront properties to limit the visual impact of large parking areas visible along the creek this reduction assumes that much of the parking will be accommodated with onstreet parking and in shared public lots in the area this requires fewer parking spaces to be provided on the property for site plan approval however new site development plans must illustrate that they have the area to accommodate regular parking requirements as per  40534j should it later be determined that the original number of spaces is insufficient this reserve parking area should be left undeveloped in its natural vegetative state or landscaped as green space 1 in figure 6  required number of offstreet parking spaces in rfr district waterfront properties a

depth measured back from the front facade no false facades are permitted as a means of meeting the twostory minimum requirement 2 the majority of the building mass should be placed at the front of the

the height of structures with gable ends facing the street should be measured by the vertical distance from the ground to the peak of the roof structures which have their roof ridge running parallel to the street should be measured by the vertical distance from the ground to the lowest part of the roof 6 maximum parapet height is four feet unless otherwise required by state or federal codes 7 no

the city of kingston also finds and declares that there are some uses such as adult uses which due to their very nature have serious objectionable characteristics the objectionable characteristics of
