dwelling registration article x shortterm rentals purpose the city council finds that the shortterm rental of dwellings and dwelling units within the city of south haven is a matter closely connected with the public health safety and welfare of the community the city council has enacted this regulatory ordinance in an attempt to strike an appropriate balance between the interests of community residents community business owners visitors to the community and real property owners wishing to engage in shortterm rental of dwellings and dwelling units while visitors to the community who rent dwellings and dwelling units on a shortterm basis bring many benefits to the community they can simultaneously create concerns surrounding issues of traffic parking congestion litter noise and other similar issues meanwhile issues related to fire safety and life safety codes must be considered in order to maximize the safety and wellbeing of all in the community this article is intended to strike the appropriate balance between competing interests in striking that balance the city council finds that residential properties are primarily situated in singlefamily residential neighborhoods which are significantly different in character from the mixeduse areas of the city residential neighborhoods and mixeduse areas have different tolerances and expectations regarding sounds parking congestion privacy entertainment and other activities the city council finds that there is decreased sensitivity to larger occupant loads within the mixeduse areas of the city given the comparatively larger lot sizes increased spacing between structures louder average noise levels and greater amounts of available parking compared to conditions existing in singlefamily residential neighborhoods for these reasons the city council has determined that mixeduse areas of the city are more appropriate for higher numbers of occupants to be allowed in dwelling units during a shortterm rental compared to the singlefamily residential neighborhoods of the city definitions when used in this article the following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section a bedroom  a room

evaluation of expected impacts of proposed projects to assist in decisionmaking this further intended to help achieve the following objectives a provide a standard set of analytic tools and format for preparing traffic impact studies b allow the community to assess the effects that a proposed project may have on the community by outlining information needed and evaluation procedures to be used c help ensure safe and reasonable traffic operating conditions on streets and intersections after development of the proposed use d reduce the negative traffic impacts created by individual developments and which may negatively impact such developments by helping to ensure the transportation system can accommodate the expected traffic safely and efficiently e for rezonings the traffic impact study is intended to evaluate if the rezoning is timely and if inconsistent with the comprehensive plan if the rezoning would be a logical alternative to the comprehensive plan f realize a comprehensive approach to the overall impacts of various developments along a corridor or within part of a community rather than a piecemeal approach g provide direction to community decision makers road agencies and developers of expected impacts of a project h alert the community transportation agencies and developers of improvements or modifications needed to the roadway access or site design i protect the
