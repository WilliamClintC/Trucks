applicable standards as set out in 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405 incorporated herein upon promulgation of national categorical pretreatment standards for a particular user the said standard if more stringent than the limitations imposed under this chapter for sources in that category shall when effective immediately supersede the limitations and conditions imposed under this chapter the director shall notify all known affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under division 3 of this article and 9vac2531780 1 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the director should impose an alternative limit using a flow weighted analysis from the combined wastestream formula in 40 cfr e as incorporated by 9vac2531780 2 where a pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 cfr c as incorporated by 9vac2531780 once incorporated into its control mechanism the individual user must comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 3 an industrial user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard from epa if the user can prove pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 cfr as incorporated by 9vac2531780 that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by epa when developing the categorical pretreatment standard 4 categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted by the director to reflect the presence of pollutants in an industrial users intake water ie net gross adjustment in accordance with 40 cfr as incorporated by 9vac2531780 5 subject to the procedural and substantive requirements of 40 cfr as incorporated by 9vac2531790 the director may grant removal credits to an industrial user to reflect the hrwtfs removal from the potw of pollutants specified in the categorical pretreatment standards the removal credit shall be equal to or less than the hrwtfs consistent removal rate upon being granted a removal credit an industrial user shall calculate its revised discharge limits in accordance with 40 cfr a4 as incorporated by 9vac2531790 6 subject to the procedural and substantive requirements of 9vac2531780 c 5 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the director convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the director the director may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the following conditions in subsections 6a1 of this subsection as follows a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must 1 employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its control mechanism  2 currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3 provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4 not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and 5 have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits b an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1 maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2 continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3 continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the director whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection 6a3 of this subsection upon notification of a revised production rate the director must reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4 continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 6a1 of this subsection as long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the director 1 will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentration based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 upon notification of a revised production rate must reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection 6d of this subsection the industrial user must also be in compliance with 9vac2531890 regarding the prohibition of bypass d the director may not express limits in terms of mass for pollutants such as ph temperature radiation or other pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass 7 the director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards in 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users under the following conditions when converting such limits to concentration limits the director must use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by section 3160 the conversion is at the discretion of the director  state pretreatment standards industrial users are required to comply with any
