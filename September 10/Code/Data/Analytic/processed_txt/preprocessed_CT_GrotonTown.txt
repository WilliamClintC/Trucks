applicability of individual practices varies depending upon relatively simple physical constraints as well as more complicated siting and treatment issuesthis chapter addresses criteria to consider when selecting stormwater treatment practices for a particular site 81 stormwater management effectiveness as discussed in land development increases the potential for several stormwater related impacts these impacts are largely a function of altering the natural hydrology at a site and increasing exposure to potential pollutants common stormwater impacts related to land development include degraded water quality increased peak flow rates increased runoff volume stream channel erosion and reduced groundwater recharge as discussed in stormwater treatment practices can achieve one or more of the following management objectives  pollutant reduction  groundwater recharge and runoff volume reduction  stream channel protection and peak flow control table 81 summarizes the relative effectiveness of each stormwater treatment practice in providing these management capabilities the effectiveness ratings provided in the table should only be used to compare the relative management capabilities of different treatment practices the ratings should not be used in an absolute sense to quantitatively predict actual field performance as described in there is currently a lack of reliable performance data for stormwater treatment practices in the state of connecticut additionally the available performance data from past monitoring studies conducted throughout the united states are limited by differences in design performance goals site parameters storm events flow and pollutant loadings seasonal variations monitoring methods and efficiency calculation methods or simply by the lack of or inadequate information the reliability of pollutant removal efficiencies which are often cited in guidance documents is typically poor due to the large degree of uncertainty in the data additional performance monitoring using standardized methods and quality control procedures is recommended for new and existing stormwater treatment practices see  in connecticut to provide a more useful set of data on the effectiveness of individual stormwater treatment practices and to better understand the relationship between treatment practice design and performance as shown in table 81 most of these primary treatment practices are similarly effective at removing sediment nutrients and metals removal efficiencies are generally highest for sediment while nutrient and metals removal efficiencies are typically lower infiltration systems are generally the most effective practices for removal of bacteria designs that incorporate floatable controls or pretreatment are most effective for removal of hydrocarbons treatment practices that incorporate biological removal mechanisms such as constructed wetlands are also more effective in removing pollutants than systems that strictly rely on gravity or physical separation of particles many of these practices also have limited effectiveness in terms of peak flow control and groundwater recharge open bottom basins and dry swales provide some groundwater recharge but only practices specifically designed as infiltration structures will provide significant levels of groundwater recharge many of these practices either have an impermeable bottom or are designed to intercept groundwater and thereby provide little infiltration similarly attenuation of peak flows requires significant available storage capacity to temporarily store runoff as the peak flow is being throttled many stormwater treatment practices provide limited storage capacity or detention time and are inadequate as standalone flood 2004 connecticut stormwater quality manual 83 control facilities separate facilities for peak flow control are often necessary to augment stormwater treatment practices a treatment train approach should be considered when selecting treatment practices for a particular site when faced with several sometimes competing demands as discussed in a treatment train consists of a series of management practices each designed to provide targeted pollution control benefits for example one practice may be selected for its ability to remove sediments while another may be better suited to remove dissolved pollutants 82 land use factors land use both current and potential future use should be considered when selecting stormwater treatment practices some practices are more neighbor friendly than others other practices are more land intensive and may be less desirable where space is at a premium the following land use factors should be considered when selecting stormwater treatment practices rural rural areas are typically characterized by lowdensity development ie few neighbors and relatively large amounts of available space stormwater treatment practices with larger area demands may be easier to locate with appropriate buffers in rural areas additionally typical stormwater pollutants from rural areas include sediments and nutrients which can be effectively managed by most stormwater treatment practices as a result most treatment practices are suitable for rural areas residential medium to highdensity residential areas typically have limited space and higher property values compared to rural undeveloped areas also treatment practices in these areas are likely to be located in close proximity to residences public safety and nuisance insects are common concerns for treatment practices in residential areas stormwater treatment practices with large land requirements or open pools of water may be less desirable in these areas in some situations stormwater ponds or other open water

landscape as natural amenities to provide habitat recreation and aesthetic value roads and highways roads and highways typically generate high stormwater pollutant loads due to vehicle traffic and winter deicing activities sediments metals chlorides and hydrocarbons are the primary pollutants associated with roads and highways nitrogen from vehicle exhausts and bacteria are also commonly present in road and highway runoff as a result most treatment practices provide some treatment benefit but do not adequately address all of the water quality impacts associated with this land use in addition open water and deep pools can also be a safety issue near roads and highways commercial and industrial development commercial and industrial areas often have more intensive traffic increased risk of spills and exposure of materials to precipitation pollutants associated with these land uses can vary significantly depending on the nature of activities at each site although traffic related pollutants such as sediments metals and hydrocarbons are commonly present in runoff from most commercial and industrial sites these developments may also have more available space for locating stormwater treatment practices ultraurban sites ultraurban sites are the most restrictive in terms of treatment practice selection these sites are characterized as having little available space or

adapted from nydec 2001 2004 connecticut stormwater quality manual 85 83 physicalsite feasibility factors physical site constraints can also dictate the feasibility of specific stormwater treatment practices these physical constraints can either make the installation of a particular treatment practice too costly or result in reduced or ineffective operation while every site has its own individual characteristics that need to be evaluated the five most common physical constraints that need to be considered are  infiltration capacity  seasonally high groundwater water table  drainage area  slope  required hydraulic head these factors are discussed in general terms below contains additional information on physical feasibility and siting considerations for individual treatment practices infiltration capacity infiltration practices are highly dependent on the infiltration capacity of the underlying soils low soil infiltration capacity requires structures with larger infiltration surface area and storage capacity to account for slower infiltration rates higher soil infiltration rates allow for smaller infiltration structures accurate field measurements of infiltration rates are critical for the successful design and implementation of stormwater treatment practices that rely on infiltration of stormwater to underlying soils in connecticut the united states department of agriculture usda natural resources conservation service nrcs has developed soil suitability rankings for various types of stormwater management practices including infiltration trenches underground infiltration galleries stormwater wetlands and stormwater ponds the soil suitability designations are intended to facilitate proper selection and siting of stormwater controls and are based upon nrcs soil survey soil properties and landscape criteria the information can be used to generate soil suitability maps for a town watershed or other designation soils are rated for each practice suitable fair or good and the specific limitations slow infiltration for example are provided this tool is intended to be used for initial screening of stormwater treatment practices and does not eliminate the need for onsite evaluation of soil characteristics for design purposes additional information on this program can be obtained from the connecticut usda nrcs see additional information sources at the end of this chapter water table an elevated water table poses several design issues the primary issue is the loss of storage and retention capacity in unlined treatment structures if seasonally high groundwater exists above the bottom of an unlined pond or basin groundwater will drain into the structure and fill or displace volume that may have been intended for retention if a treatment practice is constructed below the seasonally high water table the loss of storage capacity should be accounted for in the design or engineering controls such as liners andor underdrains should be considered an elevated water table may be advantageous for some treatment practices where a permanent pool of water is desired such as stormwater wetlands however small separation between the bottom of a treatment structure and the water table may result in inadequate pollutant attenuation and treatment in the unsaturated zone the potential for groundwater pollution due to stormwater infiltration is an important consideration in the design of stormwater treatment practices engineering controls such as impermeable liners may be required in these circumstances buoyancy of structures installed below the water table is another issue related to a high water table below the water table buoyancy is calculated as the weight of water displaced ie the volume of the structure below the water table multiplied by the unit weight of fresh water or 624 pounds per cubic foot the upward buoyant force may be large enough to displace a structure sometimes out of the ground engineering controls typically consist of anchors such as connecting the structure to an appropriately sized concrete pad to provide adequate weight to offset buoyant forces field determination of seasonally high groundwater is required for the successful design and implementation of most stormwater treatment practices drainage area the efficiency of most treatment practices decreases with increasing drainage area and volume of stormwater runoff an increased hydraulic load can increase velocities and reduce detention time in a treatment structure the size of some practices can be increased to address the issues associated with an increased hydraulic load other treatment practices are better suited to smaller drainage areas and smaller hydraulic loads one approach to improving the efficiency of practices serving larger drainage areas is to construct diversion structures for treatment of the water quality volume while larger flows or volumes are bypassed around the treatment system 86 2004 connecticut stormwater quality manual slope the ground slope at and immediately adjacent to the location of a treatment practice as well as the slope of the contributing watershed and drainage flow paths are important factors in determining the feasibility of treatment controls most stormwater treatment practices are sensitive to the local terrain slope for example swales and infiltration basins cannot be used in steep terrain while others such as stormwater ponds and filtering practices can be adapted to most terrain the slope of the contributing drainage area or watershed can influence erosion and sediment loads to the treatment system many stormwater treatment practices are not recommended for sites with significant sediment loads without suitable pretreatment required head several practices such as stormwater filtering systems require larger hydraulic head for gravity flow to and system for example if only four feet of grade exists on a site between the most hydraulically remote point on the site and the invert elevation of the discharge a treatment practice that requires five feet of head would not be feasible table 83 summarizes the physical feasibility criteria discussed above 84 downstream resources while all sites should provide at least a minimum level of protection stormwater treatment practices should be tailored not only to the conditions that exist at a particular site but also to the downstream resources that could be impacted by stormwater discharges from the site as a result the following downstream resources should be considered in the treatment practice selection process sensitive watercourses streams brooks and rivers that are classified by dep as class a fishable swimmable and potential drinking water as well as their tributary watercourses and wetlands are high quality resources that warrant a high degree of protection toxic pollutants such as metals and soluble organics as well as other contaminants such as bacteria are the primary concern for these waterbodies sensitive cold water fisheries including class b waters or managed stocked streams could also be adversely impacted by stormwater runoff with elevated temperatures in addition the rate and volume of stormwater discharges from new developments are especially critical to these systems as they could impact the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse and increase the potential for channel erosion water supply aquifers groundwater is a major source of drinking water in connecticut for residences that rely on small private wells and larger water distributors this applies to both water supply aquifers and class ga and gaa groundwaters as defined by dep in addition groundwater is the source of dry weather flows baseflow in watercourses which is critical for maintaining suitable habitat as a result it is important to maintain groundwater recharge and to maintain a high quality recharge to groundwater in water supply aquifers and class ga and gaa waters lakes and ponds lakes and ponds are especially sensitive to sediment and nutrient loadings excess sediments and nutrients are the cause of algal blooms in these surface waters leading to eutrophication and degradation these conditions often result in costly dredging and rehabilitation projects in fresh water systems phosphorus is typically the limiting nutrient that is much less phosphorus is needed compared to other nutrients such as nitrogen to create eutrophic conditions as a result treatment practices should focus on nutrient removal particularly phosphorus for stormwater discharges to lakes and ponds and watercourses that feed lakes and ponds control of phosphorus is also directly related to the control of iron certain iron compounds such as ferric iron often have a high scavenging coefficient for metals thus control of phosphorus may have ancillary benefits in the control of metals surface water drinking supplies surface waters that supply drinking water are especially susceptible to contamination by bacteria and other pathogens other contaminantsofconcern may be defined for specific water supply systems by the owneroperator or the state department of health treatment practices for sites within drinking water supply watersheds should target these potential contaminants the public health requires a 100foot separation distance between drainage or treatment practice outlets and public water supply tributaries site designs within public water supply watersheds are encouraged to maximize absorption of pollutants by the soil and vegetation estuarycoastal coastal or estuary areas are more sensitive to nitrogen loadings than fresh water systems in salt water systems nitrogen tends to be the limiting nutrient as opposed to phosphorus bacteria are also a concern given the sensitivity of public swimming areas and shellfish beds to bacterial loadings table 84 summarizes limitations and

factors regular maintenance is required for the successful longterm operation of any stormwater treatment practice accumulated sediment and floatables reduce pollutant removal efficiencies and increase the potential for resuspension as well as sediment reflux accumulated debris can also impact hydraulic performance some treatment practices require more intensive or more frequent maintenance in order to function as designed for example the filter bed of a sand filter needs to be replaced when clogged and stormwater wetlands need to be harvested periodically table 85 summarizes the maintenance requirements for stormwater treatment practices maintenance sensitivity is a measure of a practices susceptibility to reduced performance if not adequately maintained 86 winter operation

practices with the exception of vegetative filter strips rely on some form of inlet piping and may also have an outlet or underdrain pipe frozen pipes can crack due to ice expansion creating a maintenance or replacement burden in addition pipe freezing reduces the hydraulic capacity of the system thereby limiting pollutant removal and creating the potential for flooding center for watershed protection 1997 ice formation on the permanent pool ice cover on the permanent pool causes two problems first the treatment pools volume is reduced second since the permanent pool is frozen it acts as an impermeable surface runoff entering an icecovered pond can follow two possible routes neither of which provides sufficient pollutant removal in the first runoff is forced under the ice causing scouring of bottom sediments in the second runoff flows over the top of the ice receiving little or no treatment sediment that settles on top of the ice can easily be resuspended by subsequent runoff events center for watershed protection 1997 reduced biological activity many stormwater treatment practices rely on biological mechanisms to help reduce pollutants especially nutrients and organic matter for example wetland systems rely on plant uptake of nutrients and the activity of microbes at the soilroot zone interface to break down pollutants during cold temperatures below 40f photosynthetic and microbial activity is sharply reduced when plants are dormant during the nongrowing season limiting these pollutant removal pathways center for watershed protection 1997 reduced

of infiltration practices and other treatment systems that rely on infiltration of stormwater into the soil table 86 summarizes winter operation and cold weather considerations for stormwater treatment practices includes design guidance for mitigating the potential effects of cold weather on treatment practice operation and performance 87 nuisance insects and vectors some stormwater treatment practices can provide breeding habitat for mosquitoes ticks fleas and other vectors organisms that can transmit pathogens that can cause an infectious disease such as west nile fever lyme disease and st louis encephalitis mosquitoes are one of the most prevalent nuisance insects as well as vectors of west nile fever and eastern equine encephalitis virus in connecticut and therefore are the focus of many municipal control programs the approximately 48 species of mosquitoes in connecticut can be broadly grouped into two categories those that lay eggs directly on a stagnant water surface surface water mosquitoes and those that lay eggs on a moist substrate mud leaf litter and hatch at a later date when flooded by rain or tides floodwater mosquitoes the eggs of floodwater species can lie dormant for several years until conditions are right for hatching usually however the eggs will survive over winter and hatch with the spring thaw eggs of surface water mosquitoes do not survive over the winter the adults survive during the winter in caves basements and other similar environments and emerge with warmer weather the rate of development from hatching to emergence is controlled by photoperiod length of day and water temperature in the spring this may take up to a month and a half in the summer it may take as little as 1 to 2 weeks generally speaking relative to stormwater basins and other treatment practices there is the potential for mosquito breeding if water is allowed to stand or stagnate in the absence of predators for more than 7 to 10 days in the summer roger wolfe mosquito management coordinator dep 2003 when located in residential and urban areas stormwater treatment practices that hold water for an extended period longer than 7 to 10 days have the potential to become new sources of mosquito habitat or aggravate existing mosquito problems according to national studies conducted by the california department of health services and the california department of transportation 1998 stormwater treatment practices that maintain permanent sources of standing water in sumps basins wetlands perimeter sand filters or wet swales provide habitat for immature mosquitoes and frequently support relatively larger mosquito populations catch basins with sumps provide ideal mosquito breeding conditions particularly species of the genus culex stagnant organically rich water in a shaded and humid environment devoid of predators in contrast stormwater treatment practices designed to drain more rapidly dry swales filter strips extended detention structures and infiltration structures provide less suitable habitats and rarely harbor mosquitoes treatment practices that employ a larger permanent body of open water ie ponds generally pose lower risk of mosquito breeding since larger open bodies of water are not conducive to mosquito egg laying and unless extremely polluted a pond community structure will 812 2004 connecticut

2004 connecticut stormwater quality manual 813 support a natural predator population improperly maintained structures can also result in sediment and debris accumulation that can contribute to conditions of prolonged standing water proper siting design and maintenance of stormwater treatment practices are important factors in minimizing the potential for these structures to become mosquitobreeding areas stormwater ponds wetlands and other treatment practices that maintain standing water for a prolonged period should be carefully considered and designed in residential commercial and other urban areas where mosquito control is a concern key design considerations for mosquito control include  limiting water retention or draining time to 5 days or less based on a 7 to 10 day summer breeding period and a factor of safety structures designed with sumps or basins that retain water permanently or longer than 5 days should be sealed completely to prevent entry of adult mosquitoes  maintaining pond and wetland water quality sufficient to support mosquitofeeding fish and other aquatic predators stormwater ponds and wetlands often develop miniecosystems where birds frogs and other insects feed many of which are natural predators of mosquitoes and other nuisance insects ponds can also be stocked with fish native to connecticut that feed on mosquito larvae such as banded killfish golden shiners and pumpkinseed sunfish the dep inland fisheries division should be consulted regarding species selection and permitting requirements a liberation permit is required to introduce these and other fish into ponds and other water bodies in connecticut other natural predators of mosquitoes such as dragonfly nymphs can also be used  maintaining permanent pond water depths in excess of 4 feet to preclude invasive emergent vegetation such as cattails dense emergent vegetation provides mosquito larvae with refuge from predators  designing ponds to allow for easy dewatering of the basin when necessary  providing sufficient slope on basin floors and swales for adequate drainage  ensuring sufficient separation distance to the seasonal high groundwater table for infiltration structures  sealing potential mosquito entry points in underground stormwater treatment devices adult female mosquitoes can use openings as small as 116 inch to access water for egg laying includes additional design guidance to avoid or reduce mosquitobreeding problems for individual treatment practice categories 88 natural wetlands and vernal pools careful consideration should be given to the selection design and location of stormwater treatment practices on or near sites with natural wetlands and vernal pools conventional stormwater management techniques often have adverse impacts on biodiversity wildlife species that migrate seasonally between forested upland habitats and vernal pools and other small wetlands are particularly susceptible calhoun and klemens 2002 populations of turtles snakes small mammals frogs and salamanders often decline in areas with intensive stormwater management measures curb and catchbasin systems particularly in combination with hydrodynamic separators can intercept trap and kill amphibians and other small animals crossing roads stormwater wetlands and ponds that are placed near vernal pools can also threaten poolbreeding amphibian populations stormwater ponds and wetlands can serve as decoy pools intercepting amphibians as they migrate in spring to their vernal pool breeding habitats amphibians often deposit their eggs in these artificial wetlands the eggs rarely survive due to sediment and pollutant loads which are concentrated in these stormwater treatment systems fluctuations in water quality water quantity and temperature within these decoy wetlands can also cause reproductive failure many vernal pool species are extremely sensitive to hydroperiod duration of flooding stormwater management can dewater or shorten the hydroperiod vernal pools this impacts species that require longer hydroperiods such as marbled salamanders stormwater management can also increase the hydroperiod of vernal pools impacting species that require shorter hydroperiods eg fairy shrimp in addition constructed wetlands tend to support highly adaptable widespread weedy species eg bullfrogs or green frogs which prey upon or successfully outcompete vernal poolbreeding amphibians stormwater ponds and wetlands should be located at least 750 feet from a vernal pool and should not be sited between vernal pools or in areas that are 814 2004 connecticut stormwater quality manual primary amphibian overland migration routes if known calhoun and klemens 2002 using natural wetlands as stormwater treatment practices is also highly undesirable increases in pollutants sediments and flashiness of the system degrade the wetland and result in a reduction habitat complexity leading to reductions in biodiversity in general stormwater runoff to vernal pools should be maintained at preconstruction levels to avoid increases ordecreases in water levels and hydroperiod contains additional design guidance to avoid impacts to

guidelines this document contains design guidelines for development in the town of groton connecticut the purpose of these guidelines is to describe design principles that when applied help contribute to the quality of the public realm creating the sense of place that is the difference between communities that thrive and those that do not these guidelines are supplementary to design standards provided in the towns zoning regulations which apply to the mixed use town center mtc where the design standards included in the body of the zoning regulations are firm and require compliance the guidelines herein are meant to be more instructive the guidelines communicate the intent of what the town calls for in its plan of conservation and development pocd and other more targeted plans that examined individual village areas images are used to help clarify the design language and overall vision for each village and in some cases clarify how different choices are appropriate for different village areas these guidelines will help developers and the town discuss the character of each village and how existing conditions do or do not inform applications for development overarching principles related to village development in groton include 1 a vibrant public realm  public realm is a term of art in urbanvillage planning that is used to discuss any area where people have the opportunity to mingle gather and visually experience their surroundings the term often refers to the street rightofway park areas sidewalks bike paths plazas and similar features any of these areas may be publicly or privately owned in grotons mixed use areas great care will be taken to provide a public realm that works as a connected system of accessible and attractive spaces that will foster positive interaction between residents visitors and businesses all projects will contain a vibrant public realm or create ways to connect and be a part of a larger public realm 2 environmental best practices  the days when urban development was incompatible with achieving environmental objectives are in the past the town of groton envisions town center mixed use at various scales that incorporates stateoftheart best practices in the areas of construction management stormwater management waste management and landscaping 3 a mix of uses and densities  the town recognizes that market demand will play an important role in determining the types of uses and densities that are built in mixed use districts the town also acknowledges that the most economically resilient mixed use centers are those that foster a diverse mix of commercial uses that can respond to market trends and innovations over time similarly housing shall be provided within mixed use districts and should provide options for individuals and households at all levels of abilities incomes and preferences 4 pedestrians first  the town understands that accommodations for automobiles within mixed use areas are essential to their success however the town also recognizes that the most successful and memorable mixed use centers are those where pedestrians feel safe and welcome circulation along route 1 as well as within newly developed or redeveloped mixed use areas in groton shall be designed with the highest priority placed on developing a safe attractive accessible and intuitive pedestrian network the use of bicycles as an alternative form of transportation shall be incorporated into all development proposals 5 quality architecture  buildings and signs will be designed in a manner that conveys high quality design and a thoughtful approach to developing a sense of place within mixed use areas traditional building forms high quality building materials and attention to detail will be apparent and integral to the design process  site components mixeduse town center lighting key features  a variety of lighting types should be used to address the different needs of civic spaces pedestrian oriented streets and parking areas  lighting should be designed to provide a uniform distribution of light while also addressing safety needs  lighting should be in keeping with the character of the spaces and buildings around them industrial poles and fixtures concerned purely with functional requirements should be avoided avoid a mix of lighting types including appropriate street lights helps to establish the character of a place do street lighting has a strong effect on the character of a place this includes both the distribution of the light and the character of the light fixturepole itself street lighting is a key component to the making of a place designing site lighting purely to meet functional requirements denies its ability to support character of place street lights should reflect the character of the district with articulated treatments for the base post and fixture  mixeduse town center introduction design guidelines format the majority of the design guidelines follow the general format illustrated below design element being addressed design guidelines addressed importance of considering particular design element key features and examples showing proper application approaches and examples showing improper application mixeduse town center  building design this section of the design guidelines looks at different elements of site design within the mixeduse town center ranging from pedestrian connectivity within the public right of way row to more specific issues related to individual sites like building placement and parking location site design site design  site design mixeduse town center building location the front of the shops form a street wall that define the street as a public room retail buildings set back from the street discourage shoppers since even adjacent shops or those across the street are separated by expanses of cars and asphalt do avoid mixeduse buildings should engage the sidewalk and form a street wall that contributes to the character of the street on a traditional mixeduse street buildings engage the sidewalk a traditional retail building meets the sidewalk to engage pedestrians in windowshopping front setback area typically used for parking is hostile to pedestrians buildings help define the edge of the sidewalk in conditions where sidewalks are tight buildings should consider setting back a few feet to create ample pedestrian space mixeduse town center  site design building entry location buildings should be entered directly from the sidewalk key points  entries to retail and commercial uses should be prominent and large in scale to be clearly identifiable to the public  retail entries should be located directly off the sidewalk gallerias and indoor malls are prohibited  residential entries should be separate from public entries the location may be less prominent and the scale smaller than for retail  residential entries should have their own address separate from the retail building entries should engage and activate the street edge in mixeduse conditions there should also be a clear separation and hierarchy between retail storefronts and secondary entries for upper floor uses commercial entries connect directly to a public sidewalk do avoid diagram of entry locations secondary entrance  exits may be located facing the rear parking area but retail entrances should never solely be located at the rear a corner entrance can provide both main thoroughfare entry as well as access from rear parking retail entrances should always be located fronting the main thoroughfare provide a clear walking path from the rear parking area to the front entrance avoid locating the primary entry at the rear of a building regardless of its proximity to a rear parking area a corner entry serves customers arriving from two different directions an inset entry allows more display area and a protected place to view merchandise  site design mixeduse town center parking location offstreet parking is least disruptive behind or beside the building parking should occur behind the building alternate parking location beside the building avoid parking lots in front of the building narrow curb cut and small curb radius reduce traffic speed wide entry and exit lanes yield conditions and large curb radii allow traffic to enter or exit parking lots at dangerous speeds gaps between storefronts for parking or driveways disrupt the experience of mixeduse streets offstreet parking should be hidden to the greatest extent possible by buildings fences walls or landscaping see site components section for more details on screening and landscape successful mixeduse streets offer a continuous line of buildings and entries wall screens parking do visible offstreet parking harms traditional mixeduse streets avoid  site design mixeduse town center parking location screen parking areas from outdoor seating and sidewalks by the use of masonry walls and plantings at a minimum of three feet in height the layout and design of all means of circulation including interior drives parking areas and walkways should provide for safe delineated circulation for pedestrians and vehicles where parking abuts a sidewalk a curb at least six inches high should be included to delineate the two uses sidewalks or walkways should be included in commercial areas to provide a safe route from parking areas and retail establishments lighting in parking areas should be oriented to reflect light away from adjacent uses dark sky cutoff fixtures recommended site entrances should be minimized including sharing access drives with adjacent properties and creating contiguous parking areas wherever possible sidewalks should be a hard surface with provisions for managing stormwater runoff included as necessary where sidewalks intersect with automobile lanes raised surfaces andor durable decorative alternatives to conventional pavement shall be used to connect sidewalks or bike lanes across the automobile lanes opaque fencing andor dense landscaping should be included to screen parking areas from adjacent residential areas secondary bioswale continuous sidewalk main street  site design mixeduse town center bike parking safe and convenient parking can encourage bicycle use entry inverted u comb toast wave bicycle parking areas should well lit for safety and security separate bicycle parking from auto parking and roadways the bike parking area should be convenient to building entrances and street access but away from normal pedestrian and auto traffic bicycle parking facilities should be provided

proper installation and maintenance are required to promote health and avoid hazardous situations avoid do for pedestrians street trees can serve as a buffer to vehicular flow and as protection from the elements while also adding an element of natural beauty and softening an otherwise hard landscape street trees provide several pedestrianfriendly benefits improper maintenance or tree selection

materials such as wood fiberglass or wrought iron walls may be brick or stone masonry  the design of fences should be appropriate in scale and style to the building site and surrounding properties pvc plastic and other synthetic fences have been shown to lower property values in historic neighborhoods avoid tall stockade type fences are typically not found in a mixeduse setting dressed masonry walls wrought iron and decorative wood fences are appropriate in more urban andor formal settings and can help define boundaries like parking edges or deep setbacks chainlink fencing should be confined to the least visible locations fences and walls can have a big impact on the character of a place do low stone walls and fences can mark the boundaries of a property to identify the edge of

screening at exposed edges of surface parking lots a combination of landscaping and fencing can help screen and define the public realm proper screening of parking areas can minimize their visual impact a similar approach can be used to define the space in front of existing buildings set back from the road to create usable space for seating or programming a wall fence or landscaping can shield views to the parking area from the public way key points  when parking is exposed to the public realm a wall or fence can shield the parking area from view from the public way  including a layer of landscape can also serve to soften the edge of an otherwise broad expanse of hardscape  without such screening pedestrians will feel uneasy being surrounded by motor vehicles  this approach also works

the purpose of these guidelines is to describe design principles that when applied help contribute to the quality of the public realm creating the sense of place that is the difference between communities that thrive and those that do not these guidelines are supplementary to design standards provided in the towns zoning regulations which apply to the mixed use village center mvc where the design standards included in the body of the zoning regulations are firm and require compliance the guidelines herein are meant to be more instructive the guidelines communicate the intent of what the town calls for in its plan of conservation and development pocd and other more targeted plans that examined individual village areas images are used to help clarify the design language and overall vision for each village and in some cases clarify how different choices are appropriate for different village areas these guidelines will help developers and the town discuss the character of each village and how existing conditions do or do not inform applications for development overarching principles related to village development in groton include 1 a vibrant public realm  public realm is a term of art in urbanvillage planning that is used to discuss any area where people have the opportunity to mingle gather and visually experience their surroundings the term often refers to the street rightofway park areas sidewalks bike paths plazas and similar features any of these areas may be publicly or privately owned in grotons mixed use areas great care will be taken to provide a public realm that works as a connected system of accessible and attractive spaces that will foster positive interaction between residents visitors and businesses all projects will contain a vibrant public realm or create ways to connect and be a part of a larger public realm 2 environmental best practices  the days when urban development was incompatible with achieving environmental objectives are in the past the town of groton envisions village mixed use at various scales that incorporates stateoftheart best practices in the areas of construction management stormwater management waste management and landscaping 3 a mix of uses and densities  the town recognizes that market demand will play an important role in determining the types of uses and densities that are built in mixed use districts the town also acknowledges that the most economically resilient mixed use centers are those that foster a diverse mix of commercial uses that can respond to market trends and innovations over time similarly housing shall be provided within mixed use districts and should provide options for individuals and households at all levels of abilities incomes and preferences 4 pedestrians first  the town understands that accommodations for automobiles within mixed use areas are essential to their success however the town also recognizes that the most successful and memorable mixed use centers are those where pedestrians feel safe and welcome circulation within newly developed or redeveloped mixed use areas in groton shall be designed with the highest priority placed on developing a safe attractive accessible and intuitive pedestrian network the use of bicycles as an alternative form of transportation shall be incorporated into all development proposals 5 quality architecture  buildings and signs will be designed in a manner that conveys high quality design and a thoughtful approach to developing a sense of place within mixed use areas traditional building forms high quality building materials and attention to detail will be apparent and integral to the design process  design guidelines for the mixeduse village center introduction village area fort hill road

the street edge in mixeduse conditions there should also be a clear separation and hierarchy between retail storefronts and secondary entries for upper floor uses commercial entries connect directly to a public sidewalk do avoid diagram of entry locations secondary entrance  exits may be located facing the rear parking area but retail entrances should never solely be located at the rear a corner entrance can provide both main thoroughfare entry as well as access from rear parking retail entrances should always be located fronting the main thoroughfare provide a clear walking path from the rear parking area to the front entrance avoid locating the primary entry at the rear of a building regardless of its proximity to a rear parking area a corner entry serves customers arriving from two different directions an inset entry allows more display area and a protected place to view merchandise  site design design guidelines for the mixeduse village center parking location offstreet parking

design principles described will help preserve the existing architectural character of the neighborhood while allowing for new development and growth building design  building design design guidelines for the mixeduse village center building form do simple massing was traditionally necessitated by the limited time skill and resources available simple forms translated into buildings that were economical for homeowners to build and easy to maintain complexity and interest occurred with the grouping of structures at the scale of the street or neighborhood rather than within a single building traditional buildings are composed of simple volumes simple rectangular volumes are functional and economical key points  traditional buildings take advantage of the efficiency and economy of simple building forms  roofs can help express the hierarchy of building volumes generally a single dominant roof form is clearly legible with the roofs of secondary volumes deferring in scale to the main body of the building  good proportion and proper detailing can make even a basic form elegant classic main streets are comprised of several buildings each with its own character but following general principles that create a cohesive whole avoid multiple changes in slope that are expensive to build and create a visually frenetic composition avoid this building has been overly complicated by too many roof forms the additional ridges valleys and eaves are a maintenance liability  building design design guidelines for the mixeduse village center building form traditional buildings change over time to accommodate the needs of new generations additions may provide for an expanding program but always defer to the mass of the original building additional forms can add interest and space to a simple building the transformation of a simple primary volume with a succession of secondary elements various ways to expand and transform an existing building additions are most successful when they defer in scale and proportion to the primary form of the original building secondary masses may also be used to compose a new building to create a modern structure with the character of a traditional home that has been around for generations do historic buildings have a variety of additions including new porches wings and dormers the new spaces provide room for growth of the changing inhabitants

shown to lower property values in historic neighborhoods avoid tall stockade type fences are typically not found in a mixeduse setting dressed masonry walls wrought iron and decorative wood fences are appropriate in more urban andor formal settings and can help define boundaries like parking edges or deep setbacks chainlink fencing should be confined to the least visible locations fences and walls can have a big impact on the character of a place do low stone walls and fences can mark the boundaries of a property to identify the edge of public and private space they can also serve to help

exterior lights and sign illumination should be designed located installed and directed in such a manner as to 1 prevent direct glare or light trespass on adjacent property  2 employ soft transitional light levels which are consistent from area to area  3 minimize contrast between light sources on the site lit areas and dark surroundings  and 4 be confined within the target area 2 light poles foundations for light poles should not exceed twelve inches above the average surrounding grade and should be located and designed to avoid potential contact with vehicles 3 mountingtilting of lights the effectiveness of full cutoff or fully shieldedrecessed lighting should not be defeated by mounting or tilting the bottom of the luminaires at an angle above the horizontal plane 4 flag pole lighting lighting designed to highlight flagpoles should be targeted directly at the flag 5 nonessential lighting all nonessential lighting such as display aesthetic parking and sign lighting should be configured for photocell on  time clock off operation and turned off generally after business hours leaving only the lighting or reduced lighting levels necessary for site security where necessary lighting for site security may be configured for motion or infrared sensor operation 6 horizontal illuminance to provide uniform site lighting in vehicle and pedestrian areas that improves visibility and safety and maintain minimum levels of light and appropriate average levels of light in these areas the site should be designed to maintain horizontal illuminance recommendations set by iesna in accordance with table 1 the zoning official can make the determination of a lighting zone for a site or an adjacent site where it cannot be clearly determined the lighting zone of an adjacent vacant site should be designated in accordance with the likeliest use in the underlying land use zone given the current or proposed use of the site being developed or modified the horizontal illuminance recommendations in table 1 are measured in footcandles on the ground these are guidelines and it is noted that light levels can be affected by many variables on the site and moderate deviations from the table in a photometric plan is expected while wholesale deviations in orders of magnitude should not be proposed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 town of groton ct zoning regulations  purpose & application

with fronttoback configurations or upanddown layouts should be considered as an alternative to sidebyside and mirror image development layouts should be varied and units staggered to create architectural diversity 9 in predominantly singlefamily neighborhoods twounit dwelling development should a respect the established scale of the street and avoid long continuous faade frontages by designing the units to meet any one or a combination of the following  maintain the impression of a singleunit development on the lot  visually break large massing into smaller individual components to express strong unit identity  offset the units from one another  provide separate structures rather than a single large structure b create visual interest by providing variations in height massing and articulation of the front faades and not a mirror image design c if front porches are a part of the neighborhood pattern a new building or new entry should consider including this feature similar
