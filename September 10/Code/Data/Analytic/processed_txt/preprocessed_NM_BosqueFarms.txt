governmental units to adopt regulations designated to minimize flood losses therefore the governing body of the village of bosque farms new mexico does ordain as follows  1112 findings the flood hazard areas of the village of bosque farms are subject to periodic inundation which results in the loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  1113 purpose it is the purpose of this to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to protect human life and health  minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  minimize prolonged business interruptions  minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  1114 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purpose this uses the following methods restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  village of bosque farms nm ecode360  228346 b c d e require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage
