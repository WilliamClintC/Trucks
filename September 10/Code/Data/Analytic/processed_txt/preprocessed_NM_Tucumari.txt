about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the

to which the city is a party  flood control statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and methods   statutory authorization the legislature of the state of new mexico has in new mexico state statutes annotated 1953 comp delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city commission of the city of tucumcari new mexico does ordain as follows part 2003 ia 1987   findings a the flood hazard areas of the city of tucumcari are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage part 2003 ib 1987   purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to a protect human life and health  b minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d minimize prolonged business interruptions  e minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  f help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and g insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area part 2003 ic 1987   methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  d control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands part 2003 id 1987   definitions unless specifically defined below words or
