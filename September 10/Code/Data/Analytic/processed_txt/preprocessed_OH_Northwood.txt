adopted by and for the city for the purpose of encouraging investment and the creation of jobs within the enterprise zone in the city city of northwood enterprise zone guidelines introduction in an effort to encourage investment in the citys industrial base the city of northwood has designated an enterprise zone pursuant to state law an enterprise zone is an area within which special tax incentives may be offered by contract to businesses that agree to invest in capital improvements and create or retain jobs tax incentives will be offered provided program guidelines are met and a substantial investment is made jobs must be either created or retained each contract with a business within the zone relating to jobs investment and tax incentives must be submitted to the city for its approval purpose the purpose of the enterprise zone is to encourage as much investment and job creation as possible within the boundaries of the enterprise zone retaining jobs is also a priority each contract negotiated with a local business shall be designed to encourage capital investments while creating or retaining jobs in return the city of northwood will agree to provide only the amount of tax incentives necessary under the circumstances of each transaction to allow the project to go forward eligible businesses only those businesses that are qualified by financial responsibility and business experience to create and preserve employment opportunities in the zone and to improve the economic climate of the municipal corporation ohio rc 570963a may apply for the tax incentives available furthermore only businesses engaged in manufacturing warehousing research and development and distribution will be eligible to apply for tax incentives no housing commercial retail or institutional uses may benefit from the enterprise zone program incentives offered in order to maximize the collection of new tax revenues only the minimum abatement necessary to bring about the investment will be offered the incentives that can be offered are only in terms of new real and personal property related to the specific project state law permits up to seventyfive percent abatement for a period of up to ten years in a municipal corporation the level of incentives can be stepped to allow for a higher initial incentive level however the average incentive level can be a maximum of sixty percent for the term of the agreement in very unusual circumstances the municipal corporation can offer tax incentives in excess of seventyfive percent but these incentives must be approved by the local school board optional services or assistance may be provided to a prospective business by the municipality or county for a period of up to ten years as well expanded incentives the ohio enterprise zone law allows a local government to expand the potential incentives to include existing taxable assets in only two particular situations 1if a business plans to purchase and operate a large manufacturing operation that has employed an average of 1000 employees per year during the past five years which operation has closed or has announced closure proceedings the local government may grant an exemption of up to 100 percent of the existing real and personal property for up to ten years 2if a business agrees to remediate an environmentallycontaminated facility expending at least 250 percent of the existing value of the facility on a new investment project including at least a ten percent investment on remediation activities then the local government can exempt up to fifty percent of the existing real property and 100 percent of the new real and personal property investment described as the project income tax sharing substitute senate bill 19 ssb 19 which became effective  requires that all tax incentive negotiations with companies generating one million dollars $1000000 or more of new annual payroll and located within a municipal corporation which imposes a local income tax must include a compensation agreement with the board of education of the affected school district having jurisdiction over the project site if the municipal corporation and the board of education cannot reach an agreement within six months of the formal legislative approval of the enterprise zone agreement then the board of education shall be compensated with fifty percent of the local income tax generated by the new employees procedures to arrive at this compensation agreement are defined in exhibit a attached to passed  school board notification house bill hb 627 has been passed by the ohio legislature among many other issues the bill changes the required notice period to boards of education where the incentive package exceeds the statutory limits the notice period is changed from thirty calendar days to fortyfive working days this change affects not only the enterprise zone program but also the urban renewal impacted cities new community reinvestment area and tax increment financing programs the new legislation gives the affected board of education the express ability to waive the notice provision or to approve the project which would end the notice period prospectively hb 627 was approved as emergency legislation and takes effect immediately upon the governors signature which is expected within the next week local jurisdictions considering tax exemption packages which exceed the statutory cap should implement the new notice provision on all pending projects to avoid compliance controversy odod will be updating the enterprise zone program

municipal park and recreation committees the planning commission shall also consider the suitability of the site for park purposes or development its relationship to population concentrations and its proximity to other park or recreational lands c minimum size the minimum size of any land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be no less than 10000 square feet one dimension of which cannot be less than 100 feet except that the planning commission may recommend that council accept the dedication of a smaller size when required by the specific plans of the development and when the usefulness of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is demonstrated d use of detention areas for required dedications detention areas for stormwater control shall not qualify as land for park and recreational purposes unless the use of the property for such purposes is clearly demonstrated e private open spaces and recreational areas no more than forty percent of the land required for park and recreational purposes shall be privately owned and maintained the city shall approve the detailed plans for all improvements for such park and recreational land which is

recreational land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within seven years from the date of receipt of such contribution by the city such contribution shall be refunded to the subdivider or developer who made such contribution along with any accrued interest earned on such funds cbasis for determining cash contribution the cash contribution in lieu of land dedication shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of undeveloped land in the area to be improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreational sites evidence of the value of the land shall be provided by a third party and deemed acceptable by the planning commission d criteria for requiring dedication and a contribution a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land shall be required when 1the subdivision or development does not have sufficient or adequate land to meet the dedication requirements of this section that portion of the

subdivisions major subdivisions which require the submission and approval of a plat and minor subdivisions which have an abbreviated approval process minor subdivisions or subdivisions that occur without a plat involve the division of parcels along existing public roads with no more than five lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided defines the process for approval of a minor subdivision or approval without a plat major subdivisions involve more than five lots andor the construction of new streets new public improvements condominium developments or other developments involving easements of access subsections b v hereof define the process for approval of a major subdivision plat bpreapplication meeting the subdivider is encouraged to meet with the city engineer or
