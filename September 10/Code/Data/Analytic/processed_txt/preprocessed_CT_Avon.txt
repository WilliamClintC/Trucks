within the context of the towns historical past through this planning process it was recognized that avon center differs from the traditional concept of the new england town center in that it represents a historical composite of development rather than a formally designed area centered around a formal public open space the planning process has resulted in the development of the new avon village center zone with the intention to create a zone and associated regulations that permits flexibility in future development that will still adhere to design principles and standards that are supportive of avon centers unique history and development pattern 2 purpose the purpose of the avon village center zone is to provide for village centerscale development that reflects the historic

of these regulations and in conformance with the requirements of gs  83c as amended i additional development requirements 1 subdivision of acdds if the subdivision of a acdd into individual parcels is required for development purposes the design guideline standards contained in this i will govern in place of the design guideline standards contained in the subdivision regulations of the town of avon 2 public gathering space  any mudp must include a centrallylocated open space available for public use and congregation such open space must be a minimum of 4000 square feet in size and shall be composed of a mix of appropriate landscape and hardscape elements the design and selected location for this open space must be appropriately and effectively integrated into the overall site design for the mudp with particular attention paid to its connection to pedestrian circulation systems and elements 3 development phasingland uses the intent of the avc zone regulations is to encourage cohesive mixed use developments with a balance of uses designed in a walkable village center style as such any avc zone should be developed in a balanced manner throughout its development phasing cycle the phasing plan for any mudp must take into account the need for a balanced approach for the development of individual uses it is the towns intention and desire that any mudp must be composed of a mix of land uses during all phases of its development not just as an end product therefore the following sequence of requirements for pro rating the development of specific uses shall apply to all mudps  zoning certification for up to but not exceeding 25 percent of the residential units proposed in a mudp may be issued only if 20 percent of the total nonresidential gross floor area proposed in the mudp has also received zoning certification  zoning certification for up to but not exceeding 50 percent of the residential units proposed in a mudp may be issued only if 40 percent of the total nonresidential gross floor area proposed in the mudp has also received zoning certification  zoning certification for up to but not exceeding 50 percent of the residential units proposed in a mudp may be issued only if all of the parks recreation and open space elements proposed in the mudp also have been constructed and when required conveyed to the town of avon  zoning certification for the full number of residential units proposed in an mudp may be issued only if 60 percent of the total nonresidential gross floor area proposed in the mudp has also received zoning certification the commission in its discretion may modify these percentage requirements by up to ten percentage points if the applicant can demonstrated and the commission determines that doing so would still enable the proposed development to meet the purpose and intent of the avc zone and would result in a development that is generally consistent with the town of avons plan of conservation and development it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to notify any future purchasers of property within the mudp of these conditions 4 development phasinginfrastructure given the intended unified nature of development within an mudp the construction phasing for infrastructure components that effectively link individual acdds together to form a complete mudp is a critical element in the mudp development process therefore all mudp applications must include a descriptive narrative and associated graphic illustration of the proposed phasing of infrastructure components the commission shall have the ability to modify the proposed infrastructure phasing plan in its sole discretion as a condition of approval of the mudp 5 parkingmodified standards in general the standards for the required number of parking spaces for each land use as established under b of these zoning regulations shall apply in the avon village center zone however it is recognized that the avon village center zone encompasses a unique area of the town that is envisioned as mixed use development many of which uses may have shared and complementary offstreet parking needs therefore in cases where the required number of parking spaces for a particular land use under b is greater than an applicable standard for the number of parking spaces required for such use according to data from the institute of transportation engineers ite or the urban land institute uli the commission in its sole discretion may allow the use of the lesser parking space requirement standard the applicant must provide sufficient evidence indicating that such parking reduction will neither create a shortage of parking spaces nor create ancillary negative traffic circulation impacts 6 aggregate development total aggregate development within the avc zone shall adhere generally to the following guidelines a the total residential development component within the avc shall be composed of approximately 400 to 500 dwelling units for the entire mixed use development of which no less than ten percent shall be situated in mixed use structures all dwelling units generally shall have two bedrooms or fewer b the total nonresidential development component within the avc shall be composed of approximately 500000 to 600000 square feet of gross floor area 7 culdesacs and dead end streets streets shall be laid out in a manner that promotes safe and logical traffic circulation unless specifically approved by the commission the use of culdesacs and other types of dead end streets should be avoided in all acdds that have any nonresidential land uses within acdds consisting entirely of residential uses culdesacs and other types of dead end streets may be permitted at the commissions discretion 8 earth removal and filling in general all earth removal grading and filling activities shall be conducted in a manner such that these activities will result in no net change in the amount of earth material brought into or removed from within the mudp within each individual acdd the applicant shall demonstrate a balance of cuts and fills unless waived by the commission at the commissions discretion removal of earth material from the mudp may be permitted if it can be demonstrated by the applicant that doing so would produce a better overall development design 9 utilities all utility lines serving new construction shall be buried underground in any mudp j design guidelines 1 introduction the avc zone is intended to implement the policies goals and urban design principles articulated in official town documents calling for preservation and development of a mixed use and pedestrianfriendly main street character for the avon village center including the development of new structures and uses with appropriate architectural designs and the conservation and enhancement of the character of existing buildings sites streetscapes and pedestrian environments this is accomplished with the following design and use standards that apply to new and existing architectural facades sites and buildings applied under the review procedures of this district these design guidelines are intended to preserve restore and enhance resources improve property values promote and support a vibrant business and residential environment and enhance the architectural character and attractiveness of the village center these design guidelines are intended to be implemented avon village center zone regulations they are intended to be used during review of projects proposed within the approved redevelopment areas these guidelines were created to assist both the commission and the project proponents with direction to maintain the quality of character in avons village center 2 context the avon village center zone is a subset of the larger town center of avon which includes architecture representative of a mix of periods and design styles this variation contributes to the unique character of avons village center these design guidelines seek to emulate the many positive elements of avons existing town center architectural landscape notable village center buildings from historic periods are the complex of buildings associated with ensign bickford and the stores and offices situated on the north side of west main street between ensign drive and woodford avenue while these buildings may not be assumed as models for improvements in village center buildings and properties the unique design and construction of these buildings could be used as a comparison for new construction notable contemporary buildings are also present in the village center area while these buildings do not conform to older historic character they define some of the more recent periods of architecture and must be considered as to what contributions they may provide to the overall uniqueness and character of the avon village center however changes in the buildings have not all contributed to the aesthetics of the architecture or the character of avons village center many of the singlestory commercial buildings in the surrounding area are examples of contemporary commercial buildings which are effectively only distinguishable by their tenant signage 3 principles of village center design these design guidelines are meant to apply to the public realm  those building facades and spaces that are subject to public view from public areas and in public use interior spaces and building code compliance are not the subject of these guidelines but may be considerations under these design standards overall principles include  support the village center redevelopment with projects that support multiple modes of accessibility and transit  support village center vitality with uses and spaces that contribute to the commercial and entertainment aspects of the village center and promote attractiveness for visitors and patrons of the area  reinforce the village center as a civic place with spaces for small public gatherings and discourse  use examples of existing architecture and design in the avc as models for renovation and new design k mudp dimensional requirements 1 minimum lot size for each acdd five acres unless waived by the commission in order for an applicant to receive a waiver of this requirement the applicant must demonstrate and the commission must make a determination that there are unique characteristics of the subject area

town against ratios developed by rating agencies such as moodys medians the analysis is not intended to review the towns total financial position or to make projections of future expenditures other than debt service the following debt ratios will be considered when reviewing the towns capacity to issue debt a debt burden indicators 1 debt as a percentage of net taxable grand list 2 debt per
