to make sure they are consistent with the intent of the zone and compatible with other existing and permitted uses within the zone accordingly these uses require a discretionary casebycase review and analysis for the possible imposition of conditions to mitigate the adverse effects of the use these are identified as conditional uses the purpose of this chapter is to provide standards and procedures under which a conditional use may be permitted enlarged or altered if the site is appropriate and if other appropriate conditions of approval can be met 2a conditional use permit shall not replace the variance procedure in pomc or be used to permit uses that are prohibited within the zone if a variance is desired for the same property upon which a conditional use permit is required the variance application may be filed in conjunction with the conditional use permit application and the two applications will be processed concurrently 3a use that was legally established but is now

industrialoffice properties by a minimum 20footwide landscaped buffer meeting the requirements of full screening or by preservation of comparable existing landscaping on the site 2relationship to other codes and documents where provisions of this chapter conflict with provisions in any other section of the port orchard design standards this chapter prevails unless otherwise noted herein 3for building additions remodels and site improvements three different thresholds have been established to gauge how the design standards in this chapter are applied to such projects see figure 3 below for examples of site development and the respective types of improvements required under each of the three levels of improvements alevel i improvements include all exterior remodels building additions andor site improvements that affect the exterior appearance of the buildingsite or cumulatively increase the gross floor area by up to 20 percent of the gross square footage that existed three years prior to the date of permit issuance the requirement for such improvements is only that the proposed improvements meet the standards and do not lead to further nonconformance with the standards for example if a property owner decides to replace a building facades siding then the siding must meet the applicable exterior building material standards but elements such as building articulation see pomc  would not be required blevel ii improvements include all improvements that cumulatively increase the gross floor area by 20 percent or more but not greater than 75 percent of the gross square footage that existed three years prior to the date of permit issuance all standards that do not relate to repositioning the building or reconfiguring site development apply to level ii improvements for example if a property owner of an existing home in the bp zone wants to convert the home to an office and build an addition equaling 45 percent of the current buildings area then the following elements would apply ithe location and design of the additionremodel must be consistent with the block frontage standards see of this chapter to the extent possible given the location of the existing building for such developments seeking additions to buildings where an offstreet parking location currently does not comply with applicable parking location standards building additions are allowed provided they do not increase any current nonconformity and generally bring the project closer into conformance with the standards see figure 3 for an example of this iicomply with applicable site planning and design elements see of this chapter iiicomply with all building design provisions of of this chapter except architectural scale and materials provisions related to the existing portion of the building where no exterior changes are proposed the entire building must comply with building elementsdetails materials and blank wall treatment standards of pomc  ivthe proposed improvements shall comply with the offstreet parking landscaping and signage provisions of chapters   and  pomc clevel iii improvements include all improvements that cumulatively increase the gross floor area by more than 75 percent of the gross square footage that existed three years prior to the date of permit issuance such developments must conform to all applicable standards figure 3 examples of improvement types and required compliance image 4review for compliance proposals for development including design standard departure requests shall be reviewed for consistency with the design standards as found in this chapter in conjunction with every underlying permit applications ie building permit stormwater drainage permit conditional use permit binding site plan etc at each stage of the development the city recognizes that every project is unique and that permits are not always submitted in a single package simultaneously for instance a project may require a conditional use permit building permit land disturbing activity permit and stormwater drainage permit it is common that a building permit application be submitted after site development activities have begun it is also common to develop building pads for future construction as part of an approved development   exh 3  exh 1  optional design review board project recommendation applicants for development subject to the design standards contained in this chapter may optionally request that the citys design review board provide project review and a recommendation on the application when requested by the applicant the design review board shall review permit applications for consistency with this chapter and make a recommendation to the director or hearing examiner as appropriate to the permit type who shall give substantial weight to the recommendation of the design review board as long as that recommendation does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter and is consistent with its purposes requests for optional design review board project recommendations shall be made at the time of permit application submittal exh 1  supplemental submittal requirements a preapplication meeting is strongly recommended to determine which of the below listed supplemental application materials are needed for a specific development in order to determine compliance with the design standards

opportunities are noted with the  symbol the purpose of this section is to provide applicants with the option of proposing alternative design treatments provided such departures meet the purpose of the particular standard and any additional departure criteria set forth for the particular departure opportunity 2departures are voluntary this provision allows the flexibility for applicants to propose alternative designs on a voluntary basis as provided herein 3variances versus departures variances as set forth in pomc require conditions in place on the property not created by the property owner that create practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in complying with the applicable development regulations such conditions are not necessary in order to qualify for departures which can be proposed as an alternative to complying with specific design standards in this chapter provided they comply with approval criteria listed in subsection 6 of this section 4applicability departure opportunities are available only to those specific standards that allow for departures 5review procedures departure requests are to be reviewed in conjunction with the underlying development permit and processed as set forth in pomc 1 and chapters 2022 2024 and 2025 pomc 6approval criteria project applicants must successfully demonstrate to the reviewing authority the director or hearing examiner as appropriate to the permit type how the proposed departure meets the purposes of the standard and other applicable departure criteria that apply to the specific standard 7documentation for

the main building if the finishes are similar in color and texture or if the proposed enclosure materials are more durable than those for the main structure the walls must be sufficient to provide full screening from the affected roadway pedestrian areas or adjacent use the enclosure may use overlapping walls to screen dumpsters and other materials see figure 3 below iigates must be made of heavygauge siteobscuring material chain link or chain link with slats is not an acceptable material for enclosures or gates iiiwhere the inside of service enclosures are visible from surrounding streets walkways and buildings an opaque or semiopaque horizontal cover or screen must be used to mitigate unsightly views the horizontal screencover should be integrated into the enclosure design and compatible with adjacent development ivcollection points must be located and configured so that the enclosure gate swing does not obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic or does not require that a hauling truck project into any public rightofway ensure that screening elements allow for efficient service delivery and removal operations vthe service area must be paved bthe sides and rear of service enclosures must be screened with landscaping at least five feet wide in locations visible from the street parking lots and walkways to soften views of the screening element and add visual interest departures from the provisions of subsections 3a and b of this section will be considered provided the enclosure and landscaping treatment meet the purpose of the standards and add visual interest to site users figure 3 acceptable screening enclosure image all three examples use durable and attractive enclosures with trees and shrubs to soften views of the enclosures from the side the lower left example uses a trellis structure on top  a desirable example particularly where the top of the enclosures are visible from surrounding buildings streets and walkways due to topography or building heights image 4utility meters electrical conduit and other service utility apparatus athese elements must be located andor designed to minimize their visibility to the public project designers are strongly encouraged to coordinate with applicable service providers early in the design process to determine the best approach in meeting these standards if such elements are mounted in a location visible from the street pedestrian walkway shared open space or shared auto courtyards they must be screened with vegetation andor integrated into the buildings architecture figure 4 utility meter location and screening  good and bad examples image place utility meters in less visible locations the upper and lower left examples are successfully tucked away in a less visible location andor screened by vegetation the right images are poorly executed and would not be permitted in such visible locations such meters must be coordinated and better integrated with the architecture of the building image 5location and screening of roofmounted mechanical equipment aall rooftop mechanical equipment including air conditioners heaters vents and similar equipment must be fully screened from public view both at grade and from higher buildings with the exception of solar panels and roofmounted wind turbines screening must be located so as not to interfere with operation of the equipment bfor rooftop equipment all screening devices must be well integrated into the architectural design elements as parapet walls false roofs roof wells clerestories or equipment rooms screening walls or unitmounted screening is allowed but less desirable wood must not be used for screens or enclosures louvered designs are acceptable if consistent with building design style perforated metal is not permitted cthe screening materials must be of material requiring minimal maintenance and must be as high as the equipment being screened dlocate and shield noiseproducing

identity of port orchard 2corporate architecture aarchitecture that is defined predominately by corporate identity features and is difficult to adapt to other uses is prohibited for example some franchise convenience uses have very specific architectural features such as a distinctive roofline design that functions as a sign that reinforce their identity as tenants change in these types of buildings these corporate identity features can negatively impact the character of the area and identity of new tenants these features can also be very expensive to reconfigure and adapt to new uses

purpose aconsider the type and width of the proposed articulation treatment and how effective it is in meeting the purpose given the buildings current and desired context per port orchards comprehensive plan or applicable adopted subarea plan bconsider the applicable block frontage designation undesignated block frontages warrant more flexibility than block frontages designated as varied or landscaped cconsider the size and width of the building smaller buildings warrant greater flexibility than larger buildings dconsider the quality of facade materials in concert with doors windows and other facade features and their ability to add visual interest to the street from a pedestrian scale and more distant observable scales figure 4 facade articulation departure examples image this building would be a good departure example its two clear articulation features are the window patterns and the entrybuilding modulation feature three minimum are required however the overall effectiveness of these articulation features combined with the high quality of materials and detailing and the relatively small width of the building help it meet the purpose of the standards 5maximum facade width for most buildings small scale articulation techniques see subsections 2 and 3 of this section are sufficient to reduce the perceived scale of buildings add visual interest and contribute to the pedestrian environment larger buildings need more substantial articulatedmodulated features to break up the massing and add visual interest building facades wider than 100 feet must include at least one of the following features to break up the massing of the building and add visual interest building walls facing alleys rear or side yards are not subject to the standards herein

a 20foot by 30foot courtyard along the facade to effectively break it up into smaller components meets standard figure 5ii facade width good and bad examples image both buildings use modulated entry features to help break up the perceived massing and add visual interest image the left building about 110 feet wide uses an articulated partial third floor along with smaller articulation treatments on the main floors to effectively break up the perceived scale and add visual interest this would be a good departure example the building to the right would not be an acceptable example while the articulated features on the lower floors help the monotony of the very long upper floor and roofline would not be acceptable 6roofline modulation in order to qualify as a facade articulation feature in subsections 2 3 and 5 of this section rooflines must employ one or more of the following afor flat roofs or facades with horizontal eave fascia or parapet the minimum vertical dimension of roofline modulation is the greater of two feet or 01 multiplied by the wall height finish grade to top of the wall when combined with vertical building modulation techniques described in subsections above otherwise the minimum vertical dimension of roofline modulation is the greater of four feet or 02 multiplied by the wall height ba pitched roofline or gabled roofline segment of at least 20 feet in width buildings with pitched roofs must include a minimum slope of  and feature modulated roofline components at the interval required per the applicable standard above ca combination of the above

provides an identifiable top to the building including one of the following figure 4 below illustrates acceptable and unacceptable examples aa traditional cornice line or a contemporary interpretation of a traditional cornice line such rooflines must be proportional to the size and scale of the building bunderstated cornice lines are permitted depending on the materials and design of the base and middle elements in reinforcing the basemiddletop configuration rooftop solar units are permitted provided the placement and design of units visible from the surrounding streetscape are carefully integrated into the overall design concept of the building departure alternative roofline designs may be acceptable provided the building design collectively meets the purpose of the standards for example adding additional articulation treatments andor detailing may help the building meet the departure criteria figure 4 examples of buildings employing confident and distinctive rooflines image building 1 uses a dramatic overhanging cornice at the corner the left portion of building 1 uses a very simple cornice line  to go with the upper level setback building 2 uses a traditional cornice line image building 3 uses capped projecting columns along with an understated cornice line building 4 uses a very simple roofline  which is acceptable in this case due to the prominence of the wooden canopy 5articulated building entries the primary building entrance for an office building hotel apartment building public or communitybased facility or other multistory commercial building must be

property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss exh 1  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed 1to protect human life and health  2to minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects  3to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
