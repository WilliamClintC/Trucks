provisions short title this ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the city of wilkesbarre storm water management   32411 statement of findings the governing body of the city of wilkesbarre finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  32411 purpose the purpose of this ordinance is to promote health safety and welfare within the city and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in of this designed to a meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at

management permit application and submit to the city a regulated activity is defined by this regulated activity  any earth disturbance activities or any activities that involve the alteration or development of land in a manner that may affect stormwater runoff this includes but is not limited to the clearing of wooded areas grading and excavating placement of pavement driveways parking areas roads construction of buildings and other structures homes sheds garages commercial and industrial buildings and other activities which alter the way stormwater runs off of the landscape impervious area is defined by this impervious surface impervious area  a surface that prevents the infiltration of water into the ground impervious surfaces include but are not limited to streets sidewalks pavements parking lots driveways roofs stone patios see definition of gravel crushed stone for when gravel classifies as impervious area gravel crushed stone  considered to be impervious when the intended use of the stone is for transportation purposes parking areas construction areas trails or if the gravel is compacted at any time during or after its placement  landscaping stone is not considered as impervious area depending on the amount of impervious area placed and the amount of earth disturbance to the project site this different levels of stormwater management and correspondingly different levels of design and review level 1 proposed impervious area is less than 1000 sq feet  and total earth disturbance is less than 5000 sq feet  stormwater management controls ensure that adverse downstream impacts do not occur due to redirecting stormwater flows towards nearby structures submission submit the stormwater management permit application and project sketch  the easiest mechanism is to include the application with building permits review reviewing the application will not likely require a qualified professional level 2 proposed impervious area is between 1000 sq feet  and 5000 sq feet  or total earth disturbance is between 5000 sq feet  and 10000 sq feet  stormwater management controls utilize disconnected impervious area dia for stormwater controls as

dia  the worksheet in this c1 may be used and submitted as is or may be modified as the city sees fit if dia cannot be achieved submit computations for stormwater management for small projects  the worksheet in this e may be used and submitted as is or may be modified as the city sees fit  the easiest mechanism is to include the application with building permits review reviewing the application and computations may require a qualified professional if the person responsible for issuing building permits is not comfortable with performing the review level 3 proposed impervious area is between 5000 sq feet  and 10000 sq feet  or total earth disturbance is between 10000 sq feet  and 20000 sq feet  stormwater management controls capture and permanently remove the first 2 inches of runoff over all proposed impervious areas  infiltrate at least the first 05 inches submission submit the stormwater management permit application and computations for permanently removing the first 2 inches of runoff over all proposed impervious areas  the worksheet in this d may be used and submitted as is or may be modified as the city sees fit review reviewing the application and computations will most likely require a qualified professional level 4 proposed impervious area is greater than 10000 sq feet  or total earth disturbance is greater than 20000 sq feet  stormwater management controls all requirements of this applicable including water quality and volume controls as found in peak rate controls as found in submission submit the stormwater management permit application and stormwater management swm site plan as in of this reviewing the application and swm site plan requires a qualified professional following the stormwater management permit application and accompanying sketch

plan for multiple lots without obtaining prior written approval from the city approvals and actions associated with this document do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other code law or ordinance e1 introduction these methods have been developed to allow homeowners to comply with stormwater management criteria for new projects to meet the requirements of the act 167 stormwater management the city including sizing designing locating and installing onlot measures referred to herein as best management practices bmps pennsylvania act 167 was authorized on  32 ps pl 864 and gave pennsylvania municipalities the power to regulate activities that affect stormwater runoff and surface and groundwater quantity and quality individual home construction projects on singlefamily lots which result in 1000 sq feet  to 5000 sq feet  of proposed impervious area including the building footprint driveway sidewalks and parking areas are not required to submit formal stormwater management swm site plans to the city or county  however they must address water quality and infiltration goals and submit the worksheet as outlined in this small projects document if the guidelines presented in this brochure are followed the individual homeowner will not require professional services to comply with these water quality and infiltration goals presents options of bmps that can be considered for onlot stormwater management describes requirements and outlines the method for designing a suitable bmp and a description of what needs to be included on the simple sketch plan and the small projects worksheet in table e4 contains an example of how to obtain the size and dimensions of the bmps complete the site sketch and prepare the small project worksheet the stormwater management method for small projects requires  the first 1 of rainfall runoff from proposed impervious surfaces to be captured see definition of captured in of the  the purpose of this small projects document is to help reduce stormwater runoff in the community to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources and public safety what needs to be sent to the city stormwater computations and a sketch plan must be submitted to the city the small projects worksheet found in table e4 and a simple sketch plan containing the features described in step 5 of is provided as an example or may be used for submission to the city and if applicable the contractor prior to construction e2 description of bmps the following is a description of several types of bmps that could be implemented refer to of the pa bmp manual which can be found on the pa department of environmental protections website for specifications and steps for construction for the following bmps a list of routine maintenance for each of the bmps described below is also included at the end of this section rain barrelscisterns  rain barrels and cisterns are large containers that collect drainage from roof leaders and temporarily store water to be released to lawns gardens and other landscaped areas  rain barrels are typically less than 50 gallons in size and cisterns typically have volumes of up to 1000 gallons or more and can be placed on the surface or underground rain gardenbioretention area  a rain gardenbioretention area is an excavated depression area on the surface of the land in which native vegetation is planted to filter and use stormwater runoff  depths of 10 foot or less are recommended planting species should be native to pennsylvania figure e3 typical rain gardenbioretention area table e1 sample plant list for use in a rain gardenbioretention area

pennsylvania stormwater best management practices manual dry wells  a dry well also referred to as a seepage pit is a subsurface storage facility that temporarily stores and infiltrates runoff from the roofs of buildings or other impervious surfaces  recommended depth of dry well is between 10 and 40 feet  dry well #1  structural prefabricated chamber  no stone fill  dry well #2  excavated pit filled with stone fill infiltration trench  an infiltration trench is a long narrow rockfilled trench with or without a perforated pipe that receives stormwater runoff and has no outlet  runoff is stored in the void space between the stones and in the pipe and infiltrates bottom and into the underlying soil matrix  the width is limited to between 3 and 8 feet and the depth ranges from 2 to 5 feet routine maintenance for bmps  vegetation along the surface of an infiltration trench should be maintained in good condition and any bare spots should be revegetated as soon as possible  vehicles shouldnt be parked or driven on an infiltration trench and care should be taken to avoid excessive compaction by mowers  any debris such as leaves blocking flow from reaching an infiltration trench or bioretentionrain garden should be routinely removed  while vegetation is being established pruning and weeding may be required for a bioretentionrain garden  mulch in a bioretentionrain garden needs to be respread when erosion is evident once every two to three years or after major storms the entire area may require mulch replacement  at least twice a year the landowner needs to inspect the bioretentionrain garden for sediment buildup and vegetative conditions  during periods of extended drought the bioretentionrain garden requires watering  trees and shrubs in a bioretentionrain garden need to be inspected at least twice per year by the landowner to evaluate their health if they are in poor health they need to be replaced  dry wells need to be inspected by the landowner at least four times a year and after significant rainfalls and debristrash sediment and any other waste material need to be removed and disposed of at suitable disposalrecycling sites and in compliance with local state and federal waste regulations  for dry wells gutters need to be regularly cleaned out and proper connections must be maintained to facilitate the effectiveness of the dry well  the filter screen for the dry well that intercepts roof runoff must be replaced as necessary  dry wells that are damaged need to be fixed or replaced immediately  if an intermediate sump box exists in conjunction with a dry well it must be cleaned out at least once per year  rain barrels and cisterns need to be cleared of debris routinely at least every three months and after significant storms to allow stormwater from gutters to enter them  gutters that directly convey rain water to dry wells rain barrels and cisterns need to be routinely cleared of trash and debris at least every three months and after significant storms  rain barrels and cisterns must be kept covered  rain barrels and cisterns should be routinely emptied so that they are only 14 of the way full to allow for storage of additional rainwater  overflow outlets from rain barrels and cisterns must be kept free and clear of debris  rain barrels and cisterns that are damaged need to be fixed or replaced immediately e3 determination of bmps and volume requirements all proposed impervious areas must be included in the determination of the amount of new impervious areas and the size of proposed bmps needed to control stormwater proposed impervious areas on an individual residential lot include  roof area  pavement  sidewalks  driveways  patios  porches  permanent pools  parking areas sidewalks driveways or patios that are constructed with gravel or pervious pavers that will not be converted to an impervious surface in the future need not be included in this calculation therefore the amount of proposed impervious area can be reduced for proposed driveways patios and sidewalks use of gravel pervious pavement and turf pavers all proposed impervious areas must be constructed so that runoff is conveyed to a bmp  no runoff can be directed to storm sewers inlets or other impervious areas ie street all new construction should incorporate design techniques that include minimizing the amount of land disturbance reducing impervious cover disconnecting gutters and directing runoff to vegetated areas to infiltrate and redirecting the flow of runoff from impervious driveways to vegetated areas
