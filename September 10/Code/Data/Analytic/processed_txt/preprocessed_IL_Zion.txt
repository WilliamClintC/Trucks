legislative body finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities 2 sexual acts including masturbation oral sex and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexually oriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3 offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions 4 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities 5 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films concealed from public view 6 the findings noted in section 14740c1 5 raise compelling and substantial governmental concerns 7 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those compelling and substantial governmental concerns 8 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the municipality it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9 the regulation of nudity seminudity and physical contact between employees and patrons in sexually oriented businesses will further the compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sexrelated crimes including illegal sex acts and protecting the public health safety and welfare 10 requiring open sight lines in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 11 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12 a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business 13 barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases o14  1 51705 definitions for purposes of this article employee shall mean a natural person who performs any service or work on the premises of a sexually oriented business

take into account the comprehensive plan of the city the suitability of the site for park purposes or development its relationship to population concentrations and its proximity to other park or recreational lands donated land should be reasonably accessible to all residential lots within the impacted area 3 minimum size topography soils improvements and landscaping a minimum size the minimum size of land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be no less than five acres one dimension of which cannot be less than 100 feet however the planning and zoning commission may recommend and the city council may approve after consultation with the zion park district dedications of smaller sizes when required by the specific plans of the development and when the usefulness of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is demonstrated b topography and soils 1 the site must be graded to meet topography and to meet existing drainage patterns 2 at least 80 percent of the donated land for park and recreational purposes shall be suitable in topography and soil types for recreational facilities 3 the soil shall allow construction of recreational facilities and have a soil bearing capacity to support recreational facilities recreational facilities are defined as buildings and other physical features set aside in a park site that are used by participants of the

the dedication and improvement of a fully developed park shall not exceed the contributions in lieu thereof required as set forth below b criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park sites where the development is small and the resulting land dedication is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes as determined by the city

of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of any existing local park and recreational land which already serves such needs 2 fair market value the cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area that otherwise would have been dedicated as a park and recreational site the fair market value on a per acre basis shall assume that the land is zoned residential subdivided stubbed with city sewer and water has all appropriate utilities available is improved and is otherwise property capable of being used for residential development based upon a study of real estate transactions in lake county for the past three years it has been determined that the present fair market value of such improved land in and surrounding the city as of the effective date of this article is $5000000 per acre this figure shall be reviewed annually by the city council based on real estate transactions and any other indicators as to value the fair market value as defined above shall be used in calculating any cash in lieu of land contribution herein unless timely objected to as provided in this article objections to the fair market value as defined above shall be made in accordance with the requirements of this article failure to timely object to the fair market value as defined above in accordance with the provisions of this article shall constitute a waiver of any right to raise an objection at a later time the value per acre for park land has been set less than the value per acre for school sites as the city council finds that park land is often not situated in as desirable of a location as school sites and that the topography and condition may be such that it is not considered in as prime of a condition for construction as would be necessary for school sites 3 refund of cash contributions if any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreational land dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth herein 20 years from the date of receipt it shall be refunded to the subdivider who made such contributions 4 criteria for requiring dedication and contribution in lieu of park land a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land shall be required when a the subdivision or development does not have sufficient or adequate land to meet the dedication
