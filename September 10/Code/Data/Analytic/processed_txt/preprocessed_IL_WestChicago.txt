amended the adding art iv  14501455 as herein set out purpose a whereas excessive quantities of soil are eroding from areas that are being developed for nonagricultural and agricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways and the creation of recreational facilities  and b whereas the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles and  c whereas said soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys washedout fills and embankments and  d whereas the sediment from said soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes and reservoirs and  e whereas said sediment limits the use of water and waterways for beneficial purposes destroying fish and other aquatic life and that said sediment is costly and difficult to remove and  f whereas said sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways resulting in greatly increased chances of flooding at grave danger to public health and safety g therefore the city council declares the purpose of this article is to provide minimum standards to safeguard persons to protect property and prevent the despoliation of the environment and to promote the public welfare by regulating and controlling the design construction quality of materials and use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or

and concentration of adult business uses within a municipality 1 st paul division of planning at the minnesota crime control planning board 1978 study of relationships between sexuallyoriented and alcoholoriented adult entertainment business  2 minnesota crime prevention center study on the effects of sexoriented and alcoholoriented adult entertainment upon property values and crime rates 1980  3 indianapolis department of metropolitan development division of planning 1983 study of sexually oriented businesses and property values  4 indianapolis department of metropolitan development

p2d 1153 b the city finds that the negative secondary effects associated with adult business uses as adopted pursuant to subsection a above are applicable to the location of adult business uses in the city and that the regulation of adult business uses is necessary to lessen said negative secondary effects including but not limited to lessening the following negative secondary effects 1 there is a statistically significant correlation between the location of adult business uses and neighborhood deterioration 2 that the location of an adult business use in a neighborhood has a negative impact on property value 3 that the negative impact on property values increases when more than one 1 adult business use is located within a given area 4 that the effect of adult business uses on the crime rate is positive and significant 5 that there is a significantly higher crime rate associated with two 2 adult businesses located in a given area than is associated with only one adult business use in a given area 6 that adult business uses should be located in areas of the city which are not in close proximity to residential uses schools and other retail business uses as well as areas frequented by minors 7 that residents of the city and persons who are nonresidents but use the city for shopping and other needs will move from the city or shop elsewhere if adult business uses are allowed to locate in close proximity to residential dwellings schools or other retail business uses 8 that the location of adult business uses in a given area creates the perception in the city that such area is an unsafe and undesirable part of the city therefore adult business uses should be separated from other dissimilar uses just as any other land use should be separated from uses with characteristics different from itself the reasonable regulation of the location of adult business uses will provide for the protection of the image of the city and its property values and protect the residents of the city from the negative secondary effects of such business uses while providing to those who desire to patronize adult business uses such an opportunity in areas of the city which are appropriate for location of adult business uses  122198 1126  amortization of existing adult business uses any adult business use which lawfully existed on  and which became nonconforming by reason of the adoption of

station providing basic first line units for initial response to fires and emergency medical service needs requires two and fourtenths 24 acres of land each such local fire station is supported be a central andor regional fire station providing additional first line units specialized equipment and training and administrative facilities requiring an additional sixtenths 06 of an acre for each such local fire station which it supports each individual local fire station therefore requires a total of three 3 acres of land for itself and the additional incremental area for a central andor regional fire station each area of residential development of two 2 square miles ie 1280 acres generates the need for an individual local fire station each area of nonresidential ie commercial andor industrial development containing six million two hundred fifty thousand 6250000 square feet of nonresidential buildings generates the need for an individual local fire station the required land dedication shall be determined for residential developments or residential portions of developments by multiplying the total acreage to be developed by  ie the ratio of three 3 acres required for fire protection purposes per 1280 acres of territory the required land dedication shall be determined for nonresidential developments or nonresidential portions of developments by multiplying the total building square footage to be constructed by  acres per square foot ie the ratio of three 3 acres required for fire protection purposes per 6250000 square feet of commercial andor industrial buildings 32

environment 4 the courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under title vii of the civil rights act of 196 as amended one 1 example of sexual harassment is where a
