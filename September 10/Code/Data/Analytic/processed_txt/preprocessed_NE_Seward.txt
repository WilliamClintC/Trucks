findings from the environmental research group to the american center for law and justice  the council finds  32911 general provisions  32911  1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 7 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 8 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 9 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidents of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 10 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the  32911 seward code  32911  sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 11 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 12 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 13 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter  32911 general provisions  32911  article ii definitions and interpretation  32921 terms defined as used in this

per unit within a residential development for example a fortylot subdivision on a tenacre 435600 square foot tract will have a site area per unit of 10890 square feet site area per unit which measures gross density may differ from minimum lot size in conservation development the site area per unit will be larger than minimum lot size permitting the clustering of lots in exchange for common open space in multifamily development the site area per unit will usually be smaller than minimum lot size because the lot is the legal parcel on which a multipleunit building is built b minimum lot area this indicates the minimum size of a legally described and recorded parcel upon which development can take place as noted above minimum lot area and site area per unit may not be the same c minimum lot width this is the required minimum distance connecting at points along opposite side lot lines measured at the required front yard setback for example the lot width of an irregular lot in a district requiring a twentyfivefoot front yard setback is determined by 1 locating the points along each side lot line at a distance of 25 feet back from the front property line 2 drawing a line connecting these two points 3 measuring the length of this line the length is the lot width d minimum yards these define the required setbacks of buildings from front side and rear property lines while the yard requirements apply to a majority of development this chapter provides for a number of exceptions some of these include 1 planned developments front yard setbacks can be varied within planned developments which are reviewed and approved by the city council after a recommendation from the planning commission 2 major streets the city may require greater than normal setbacks along segments of the citys arterial street system as defined in the comprehensive development plan 3 flexibility provided by supplemental development regulations establishes supplemental regulations many of which provide flexibility or variations in setback regulations for specific contexts 4 maximum setbacks some specific zoning districts provide maximum as well as minimum setbacks these setbacks establish  410413 general provisions  410413  buildto lines that may be necessary to protect the appearance and character of special urban districts e maximum height height normally measures the vertical distance from the established grade to the highest point of a building however as established by the definition of height the point of measurement may vary for different types of buildings and roof slopes f maximum building coverage this measures the percentage of a site that may be covered by the footprint of buildings thus a 20000 square foot building on a 40000 square foot site has a building coverage of 50% this is a method of regulating the scale of buildings in an area g maximum impervious coverage this measures the percentage of a site that may be covered by buildings and other surfaces and development features which prevent the penetration of water into the ground such as driveways porches parking lots and other features limits on impervious coverage help control the velocity and quantity of stormwater runoff and provide for groundwater recharge h floor area ratio just as site area per unit controls the density of residential development floor area ratio far controls the density of nonresidential development far is the ratio of gross floor area of a building to total site area thus in an area with a maximum permitted far of 10 a 40000 square foot building may be located on a 40000 square foot site naturally because of coverage ratios landscaping and parking requirements such a building will be multistory i maximum amount of total parking located in street yard this controls the maximum amount of parking that can be located in the area between a building facade and the street when applied in certain zoning districts it is intended to reduce the number of cars seen from the street encourage site planning which locates parking in rear and side yards and produce a stronger relationship between buildings and streets for example a project with 100 parking stalls and a fiftypercent limit on the amount of parking located in street yards must locate 50 of its stalls in rear or side yards without street exposure j minimum depth of landscaping adjacent to street rightsofway this establishes the depth of landscaping that must be provided on private property adjacent and in from the rightofway line thus if the required minimum depth is 15 feet a project must landscape the first 15 feet of its site back from the rightofway line all landscaping must be done in accordance with establishing landscaping standards k minimum bufferyard requirements this establishes the depth of a bufferyard that must be provided by intensive land uses adjacent to primarily residential land uses in residential zoning districts all 463 editors note

district boundaries  interpretation  appeals a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction c protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuitable for intended purposes because of flood hazard d assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program when identified by the federal insurance administration as a floodprone community a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation flood hazard areas of the city of seward nebraska are subject to inundation that results in loss of life or property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 1 general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities  b the occupancy of flood areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages 2 methods used to analyze flood hazards this article uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards that consists of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated  410291 general provisions  410292  and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods that are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a onepercent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated by applicable flood insurance studies and the federal emergency management administrations flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway map or any subsequent effective flood insurance studies rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps issued after the effective date of this article and adopted by the city of seward b calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood b land to which article applies this article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of seward identified on the flood insurance rate map firm as numbered and unnumbered a zone andor within the overlay districts fp and fw established in this article in all
