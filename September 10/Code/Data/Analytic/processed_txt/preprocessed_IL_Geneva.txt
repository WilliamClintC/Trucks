council finds 1 adult use businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of adult use businesses engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adult use businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such adult use businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult use businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the

hivaids viral hepatitis std and tb prevention proposed center for disease control june 2006 8 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in the state 9 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with 355991 cases being reported in 2007 reported by us department of health and human services november 2007 10 in his report of  the surgeon general of the united states has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 11 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 12 it has been reported that sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 13 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of adult use businesses where persons view adult oriented films final report of the attorney generals commission on pornography 1986 14 the findings noted in subsections 1 raise substantial governmental concerns 15 adult use businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 16 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the adult use businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the adult use business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult use business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 17 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 18 requiring licensees of adult use businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior and prevent minors from working in such establishments 19 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the adult use business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 20 in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 21 the fact that an applicant for an adult use business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 22 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult use businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 23 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article  132011 4172  definitions words terms and

expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the superintendent of water and sewer may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsections e and f b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the superintendent of water and sewer may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the superintendent of water and sewer shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e d a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section 1 categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of paragraph 2 of this section are met 2 criteria a either i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters b credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere c credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section d credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result e when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the superintendent of water and sewer the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections e1ae below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the superintendent of water and sewer whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent 20% from its baseline production rates determined in paragraph f1c of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the superintendent of water and sewer will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraph e1a of this section as long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the superintendent of water and sewer a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 9426 the industrial user must also be in compliance with section 94133 regarding the prohibition of bypass f the superintendent of water and sewer may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the superintendent of water and sewer g once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section 9422 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived h many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be sued in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation i any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the superintendent of water and sewer within two 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the superintendent of water and sewer of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate

upon recommendation from the plan commission in accordance with the provisions of this title  1192  purpose and objectives a planned unit developments are of such substantially different character from other special uses that specific and additional standards and exceptions are hereby established to govern the actions of the plan commission and city council a planned unit development is a privilege to be earned and not a right which can be claimed simply upon complying with all the standards established in this section the plan commission and city council may require any reasonable conditions or design considerations which will promote proper development of benefit to the community it is not intended that the city council automatically grant the maximum use exceptions or density increase in the case of each planned unit development the commission shall recommend and city council may grant only such increase or latitude which is consistent with the benefit accruing to the city as a result of the planned unit development as a condition for approval each planned unit development must be generally compatible with the character and objectives of the zoning districts within which it is located and each planned unit development shall be consistent with the objectives of the citys comprehensive plan b specific purposes of the planned unit development procedure are 1 residential planned unit development to offer recreational opportunities close to home and to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by the conservation of streams and points of natural beauty to add to the sense of spaciousness preservation of natural areas and open spaces to counteract the effects of urban monotony and congestion in the streets and to encourage cooperative relationships between neighbors and participation by all age groups in the use and care of local open space tracts in new residential subdivisions to promote appropriate architecture between adjacent dwellings or institutional buildings and to encourage the placement of structures in proper relationship to the natural characteristics of the site including cluster development where appropriate 2 office or business planned unit development to promote the cooperative development of office or business centers each with adequate offstreet parking to control access points on thoroughfares and to separate pedestrian and automobile traffic to aid in stabilizing property values and to develop centers of size and location compatible with the market potential to buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped transition areas and to encourage harmonious architecture between adjacent commercial structures and between dwellings and commercial structures business planned unit developments could include general or professional offices as well as retail and service uses several existing business locations within the city are potentially subject to redevelopment as a result of expressed public policy or general deterioration and obsolescence these locations are proximate to the more historic business and retail areas of the community because of the unique character of these business areas and the potential for incompatible development in the reuse or redevelopment the b6 planned unit development district requires mandatory planned unit development approval to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of existing conditions and needs to provide for compatible development 3 office research and industrial planned unit development to promote the establishment of research and industrial parks to permit groups of industrial buildings with integrated design and a coordinated physical plan to encourage recreational facilities within industrial areas and to buffer adjacent residential areas with landscaped green spaces to this extent office research and industrial planned unit developments will seek campus like settings for employment and manufacturing and uses which meet basic recreation and service needs because the city has planned for future employment areas proximate to residential areas the city will carefully evaluate proposed recreational and open space systems and bicycle and pedestrian system connections within and areas surrounding the planned unit development to ensure system continuity 4 development opportunity sites and redevelopment opportunity site planned unit development to promote the development or redevelopment of unused or underused sites where development should be encouraged a range of different uses may be appropriate for these sites as set forth in the citys comprehensive plan and downtownstation area master plan because of the unique character of these sites and the potential for incompatible development in the reuse or redevelopment the b6 planned unit development district requires mandatory planned unit development approval to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of existing conditions and needs to provide for
