in a water system due to the addition of heat in extreme cases thermal expansion has caused water heater explosions that have resulted in great property damage and the loss of lives bthermal expansion is an important factor to consider whenever a backflow assembly is installed on a plumbing system that supplies a hotwater system the backflow assemblies do not allow built up pressure in a water system to be back pressured and dissipated back into the water supply mains contributing to the danger of a water heater explosion due to thermal expansion c1the chances of thermal expansion increase dramatically whenever a water heater is old or not well maintained usually the first few times that a properly working temperature and pressure t & p valve is activated on a water heater it can be relied upon to guard against thermal expansion however a t & p valve is not designed to be used repeatedly in this manner in addition t & p valves can be removed or altered and made inoperable by an uninformed property owner and can also be affected by scale build up 2there are three general types of products used to protect against thermal expansion an expansion tank installed on the hot water system is one option a second less expensive option is a toilet tank ball cock product designed to vent water in the event of a line pressure buildup this may require the installation of a pressurereducing valve if line pressures regularly exceed 80 psid a third type of product would be a pressure relief valve on the cold water feed line to the water heater a drain line would be needed here if the valve is installed indoors replacing old t & p valves is also a good idea but not as effective as one of the above products prior  dideally the t & p valve should be considered as a back up to one of these other products in actuality however many people rely strictly on their water heaters t & p valve to handle any occasional excess pressure build up in all cases but especially where the t & p valve is the only safety feature in use it is recommended that the t & p valve should be exercised at least once a year and replaced at least every five years ethe greatest potential for thermal expansion problems would be from a poorly maintained water heater on a small water line with a backflow assembly installed just upstream of it all maintenance personnel need to be encouraged to make sure their water heaters and t & p valves are maintained in good condition checked regularly and replaced every five years prior  application for service   application for water and other

other safe outlets for minimum protection see    bclass 2  same as class 1 except that booster pumps may be installed in the connections from the street mains booster pumps do not affect the potability of the system  it is necessary  however to avoid drafting so much water that pressure in the water main is reduced below 20 psi for minimum protection see    cclass 3  direct connection from public water supply main plus one or more of the following elevated storage tanks fire pumps taking suction from aboveground covered reservoirs or tanks  and pressure tanks all storage facilities are filled or connected to public water only the water in the tanks to be maintained in a potable condition otherwise class 3 systems are the same as class 1 class 3 systems will generally require minimum protection approved doublecheck valves to prevent stagnant waters from backflowing into the public potablewater system  dclass 4  directly supplies from public mains similar to classes 1 and 2 and with an auxiliary water supply on or available to the premises  or an auxiliary supply may be located within 1700 feet of the pumper connection class 4 systems will normally require backflow protection at the service connection the type air gap or reduced pressure will generally depend on the quality of the auxiliary supply  eclass 5  directly supplies from public mains and interconnect with auxiliary supplies such as pumps taking suction from reservoirs exposed to contamination or rivers and ponds driven wells mills or other industrial water system  or where antifreeze or other additives are used class 4 and 5 systems normally would need maximum protection air gap or reduced pressure to protect the public potable water system  and fclass 6  combined industrial and fire protection systems supplied from the public water mains only with or without gravity storage or pump suction tanks class 6 system protection would depend on the requirements of both industry and fire protection and could only be determined by a survey of the premises bwhen a backflow prevention assembly is required for a water service connection supplying water only to a fire system the assembly

combined total use for dwelling and home occupation purposes of one or more utilities exceeds the average for residences in the neighborhood when a use is a home occupation it means that the owner

those that conform to the standards set forth in this section in general a home occupation is an accessory use so located and conducted that the average neighbor under normal circumstances would not be aware of its existence the standards for home occupations in this section are intended to ensure compatibility with other permitted uses and with the residential character of the neighborhood and a
