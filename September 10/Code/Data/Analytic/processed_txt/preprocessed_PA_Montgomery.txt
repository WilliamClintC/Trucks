affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of below are met c a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and 3 the user has submitted the following information to the potwtp or mtmsa within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days a a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  b the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and c steps being taken andor planned

have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards f users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is  18766 general provisions  18766   18767 prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in  1875a of this or the specific prohibitions in  1875b of this if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause passthrough or interference and that either  18768 bypass restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passthrough or interference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the potwtp was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements a for the purposes of this section 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c and d of this section c bypass notifications 1 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the potwtp or mtmsa at least 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible 2 a user shall submit oral notice to the potwtp or mtmsa of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment  18766 montgomery code  18768  standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the potwtp or mtmsa may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours d bypass 1 bypass is prohibited and an enforcement action against a user for a bypass may be undertaken unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under of this section 2 the potwtp or mtmsa may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potwtp or mtmsa determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in 1 of

applicability the standards requirements and procedures contained in this article shall supplement the existing submission and processing procedures of all applications for subdivision andor land developments in the township  20589 intent it is the intent in permitting sketch plans to avoid unnecessary delays and expense to both the township and the applicant issues raised at the sketch plan stage can be resolved before time and expense have been incurred in developing preliminary plans preliminary plans submitted without sketch plan approval may raise significant issues that can be resolved only by redesign  20590 tentative sketch plan submissions a all applicants for subdivision or land development may submit a sketch plan to the township planning commission applicants with proposals to subdivide a parcel of land into three or more lots or to develop a parcel of land containing one or more acres are strongly encouraged to submit sketch plans because their proposals are more likely than smaller proposals to need redesigning b tentative sketch plans shall be considered as submitted for informal discussion between the developer and the planning commission and at its option the board of supervisors submission of a sketch plan does not constitute a formal submission of an application for approval of a subdivision or land development plan c for informal purposes seven copies of the tentative sketch plan shall be submitted to the township manager for distribution to the township engineer the planning commission the board of supervisors and the montgomery county planning commission each such reviewing agency shall have comments on the sketch plan within 45 days this fortyfiveday review period shall not restrict the applicant from submitting a preliminary plan the applicant may submit a preliminary plan at any time d contents of tentative sketch plans tentative sketch plans shall be drawn to scale showing precise dimensions and shall show the following information 1 the name of the subdivision or land development and the name of municipality  20588 general provisions  20590   20591 review procedures 2 a location plan showing the

road widths and dimensions e the tentative sketch plan shall be accompanied by at least two recent photographs of all existing structures on the tract f formal review formal submission of an application for subdivision or land development begins with preliminary plan submission at which time 1 the appropriate fee to the township and montgomery county planning commission must be submitted  and 2 the requirements for formal review and approval begin as per of act 247 the pennsylvania municipalities planning a the tentative sketch plans shall be presented to the township planning commission for informal discussion at a regularly scheduled planning commission meeting following an application made to the township zoning officer or manager and a request to be placed on the agenda b the township planning commission may make nonbinding suggestions and recommendations to the applicant during the meeting at which the plan is discussed these need not be presented in writing to the applicant c if a proposal is large or complex the township planning commission may defer completing its comments and recommendations until it has 146 editors note for the municipalities planning see

205119 montgomery code  205119  article i general provisions  2061 short title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the montgomery township stormwater management   2062 statement of findings the board of supervisors finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes g impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high  2061 general provisions  2062   2063 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within the township by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in  2062 designed to water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems h nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth

encourage lower intensity land uses that are primarily nonretail or specialty retail in nature b permit land uses that are compatible with limited industrial development and are traditionally highwayoriented c encourage uses that generate low to moderate traffic volumes especially uses that produce peak traffic generation at times other than the abutting highway peak hours and traditional general retail commercial peak hours d reduce the adverse effects of driveway intersections with route 309 by encouraging businesses to coordinate locations of individual access points utilize shared access points where feasible and desirable develop an integrated circulation system among adjoining lots and develop alternative access drives where feasible e minimize the number of traffic
