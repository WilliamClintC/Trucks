ability to perform work and to eliminate and prevent discrimination on the basis of race religion sex age handicap and national origin within the city service and the jurisdiction of the city b one of the most complex and tragic problems confronting the nation today is the absence of true equal opportunity for all people while there have been civil rights laws enacted during the past to ensure such equality many individuals and institutions have been negligent in meeting the requirements of these laws to the extent that equal opportunity for all people in fact is not a reality c the denial of equal access to opportunities for development and growth has permitted discrimination to continue in a variety of forms therefore proposed remedies must go beyond the mere announcement of an equal opportunity policy we recognize and accept the responsibility to design and implement programs which strike at the total problem rather than simple overt manifestations we must strive aggressively to ensure the entry and growth of minorities and women in our work force until it is emphatically clear that equality of opportunity in the city is a reality d to achieve ultimate effectiveness in affirmative action our efforts toward equal opportunity for all people must extend above and beyond the letter of the law  that is total commitment to this goal on the part of every city employee the

by their availability minorities are conspicuously underutilized in administrative professional paraprofessional office and clerical and skilled craft job classifications women in city government hold most of the office and clerical positions but very few are found in the administrative and professional classification therefore the city is legally required to address itself to the elimination of

analysis of total traffic with improvements f conclusionsrecommendations that explain the results of analysis and consultantdeveloper or ridot suggestions for reasonable improvements to mitigate the site traffic impacts the levelofservice los standard that should be achieved at state intersections is d g appendix including all work sheets traffic counts and pertinent correspondence the following is a more detailed explanation of the various aspects involved in preparing the report a existing traffic shall include traffic counts performed at each intersection to be analyzed if current turning movement counts are not available the most recent traffic volume counts whether by ridot consultant or the city may be used for the study counts should as a rule not be more than one year old from when the report is prepared counts between one and three years old may be used if factored to the current year counts older than three years will not be accepted peak hour counts are acceptable at intersections generally from  to  am and from  to  pm counts are not to be taken on state or federal holidays the presence of schools in the area must be considered when determining the date of counts b analysis of all intersections will be analyzed using the highway capacity manual hcm at the most up to date version at the time c trip generation and distribution should use local trip generation rates if local rates are not available the latest ite trip generation rates should be used in the event ite does not address the development or is of a limited sample size studies of similar uses may be used documentation of these studies should be submitted for verification there must be some discussion of the assumptions behind the distribution of generated trips both for the site and other approved developments in the area the methodology to be used should be discussed at the scoping meeting d growth in existing traffic growth in existing traffic is described as a factor representative of travel growth outside the study area this factor should be applied to the existing appropriate turning movements before approved development traffic is applied the volume should be compounded to the reasonable build out years typically 310 years depending on the build out schedule for developments with a build out of less than 3 years growth in existing traffic need not be applied if the city does not require growth in existing traffic then this factor should not be applied e approved development traffic approved development traffic is described as traffic generated by all approved developments within the area at the time of the report preparation these sites can be obtained from the city and should be documented in the tis f background analysis background analysis includes existing traffic plus growth in existing traffic plus approved development this analysis should take into consideration all transportation improvements expected to be in place within the study area these improvements should include those which are already programmed or bonded by the state the city or developers these improvements should be documented in the tis g projected conditions shall include traffic which will be generated by the development and total traffic calculated after the site traffic is projected after total traffic is developed an analysis of traffic operations with projected future roadway improvements in place ie improvements addressed in the background analysis is to be performed after the analysis of total traffic is completed all intersections andor links within the study area resulting in a levelofservice worse than d must be identified and improvements recommended h conclusionsrecommendations should identify any improvement suggested as being implemented by others and should indicate by whom if the improvements are funded by a public agency ie the ridot then a copy of the page from the appropriate document should be included in the report if funded by another developer then documentation should likewise be included there must be some discussion of the feasibility of constructing any recommended improvements while detailed construction plans are not expected some discussion of any obvious constraints is necessary consideration should be given to providing improvements at locations that experience a significant decrease in capacity due to the proposed development a final analysis of the study area must be performed to include any recommended improvements if a traffic signal is to be proposed then a signal warrant analysis must be performed in accordance with ridots warrant analysis procedures and included in the report after review of this analysis ridot may require additional study including exploring other alternatives to signalization before reaching a final determination on the need for a signal the report should include a discussion of the improvements that the developer will construct andor fund as part of the development proposal 3 the location and size of any common or public open space including public access to and along the waterfront and the form of organization proposed to own and maintain any common

depth of 12 inches above the coarse sand or fine gravel keep water in each hole for at least four hours and preferably overnight by refilling if necessary to maintain water in each hole for this period provide a reservoir of water and an automatic siphon to deliver it to the holes intermittently or the percolation test holes should be soaked and maintained full for not less than four hours before the percolation test is made in uncompacted sandy soils containing no clay or silt the above saturation procedure is not necessary the test can be made as soon as the water from one filling has seeped away 4 the percolation test should be made following the saturation process when the saturation process is complete the water depth should be adjusted to 6 inches over the coarse sand or fine gravel before the test is begun the drop in water level should be measured from a fixed reference place such as a board laid across the hole over 30minute intervals refilling the holes to a depth of 6 inches as necessary 5 when three consecutive readings at 30 minute intervals read the same rate the test may be considered complete if no stability is reached between three 30 minute readings not less than four hours of readings must be followed the drop in water level which occurs during the final 30 minute period is used to calculate the percolation rate this rate is expressed in minutes per inch 6 soils in which the first 6 inches of water seeps away in less than 30 minutes after the saturation period the time interval between measurements should be reduced to 10 minutes and the test ran over a period of one hour the drop in water level which occurs during the final 10minute period is used to calculate the percolation rate this rate is expressed in minutes per inch 7 if an unanticipated cut in topography is made the results of any percolation test made prior to the cut is invalid a new percolation test shall be made under the changed conditions 8 in no case shall a percolation test be made in filled or frozen ground if a seepage system is to be located in filled ground a percolation test must be made in the original ground g procedures for ground water table elevation
