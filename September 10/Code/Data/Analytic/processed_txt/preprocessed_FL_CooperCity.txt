capacity if applicable of the facilities in gallons  2the volumetric load of original user will be determined by the city as a percentage of total capacity  3subsequent users load will also be determined as a percentage of total capacity  4such percentage will be applied to total cost of the offsite or oversized facilities to determine each users share of costs  5subsequent users share of costs will be collected by the city and remitted to the original applicant within thirty 30 days after collection  6no refund will exceed developers actual costs for offsite or oversized facilities

adopted level of service multiplied by the construction cost at the time of developer payment of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level of service 4for purposes of this calculation the cost shall include all improvements and associated costs such as design rightofway acquisition planning engineering inspection and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred the cost shall be based upon the cost estimate contained in the cie the mpo transportation improvement program or the fdot work program where such information is not available the cost estimates shall conform to the standards and procedures set forth in d of the broward county land development cimpact fee credit for proportionate fairshare

applicable provisions of law findings it is hereby found and determined that athe city is committed to the goal of providing public services and facilities in a timely and economically efficient manner at levels necessary to support development within the city in order to accomplish this goal the city has among other matters projected its annual growth out in 2010 to derive an estimate of the total anticipated increase in residential and nonresidential development within the city based on such projections the city has determined that residential and nonresidential development within the city will place excessive demands on the citys existing public facilities and services and contribute to the need for new andor expanded public facilities and services that would not otherwise be necessary the city has identified the capital improvements necessary to service anticipated new development has addressed these needs in the areas of funding scheduling and priority of projects in part adoption on  of a comprehensive plan comprehensive plan pursuant to florida statutes the comprehensive plan provides that new development may not be permitted to proceed unless certain adequate public facilities and services are available when needed to service such new development bthe city has determined that new development within the city should pay its fair share of the cost of providing the new andor expanded public facilities and services required to service such development in order to arrive at a formula for determining the amount new development should be required to pay the city commissioned burton & associates a professional consulting firm to prepare the impact fee study report dated  study for the purposes of the study the city manager city planner and other members of the citys staff with responsibility for parks and recreation general government and public safety analyzed the citys projections as to growth out of the city and developed a capital improvements program identifying certain specific capital improvements which were determined to be necessary to service new development in the city at required or desired levels of service in the general categories of park improvements exclusive of land acquisition general government services and public safety services including police and fire services hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the improvements the city provided information regarding the improvements including a schedule of the time when the improvements would be needed and estimated capital expenditures to be incurred over the next six years in connection therewith to burton & associates and requested that the study i consider the estimated cost of providing the improvements  and ii develop in accordance with applicable law a fair and equitable formula for computing a proportionate share of the cost of such improvements attributable to new development and allocating such cost between residential and nonresidential development in the form of impact fees as herein defined cthe study did not address capital improvements other than the improvements which may be undertaken by the city as a result of new development such as in connection with its water and sewer system and roadways or the acquisition of park land as the costs thereof are the subject of other impact fees or regulatory impositions not intended to be replaced or modified by the study or hereby dthe city now desires to accept the study and the recommendations therein as same relate to the method of computing new developments proportionate share of the cost of the improvements and allocating the same between residential and nonresidential development and to impose the impact fees suggested therein in the amount and manner more fully set forth herein ethe city hereby determines that the need for the improvements is generated by and reasonably attributable to future development within the city and benefits such development and that the impact fees to be imposed hereby 1are not in excess of new developments proportionate share of the cost of the improvements  2are consistent with the

earmarked restricted and expended in such manner as to ensure that new development receives the benefit of the improvements for which it has paid impact fees  and 5are in the best interests of the city and its residents fimpact fees will result in only partial recoupment of the capital expenditures required to finance the cost of the improvements the city anticipates that the balance of the cost of the improvements not financed by the impact fees imposed hereby shall be funded by the city from available ad valorem tax revenues and other legally available funds of the city in determining the amount of the impact fees to be imposed hereby a credit has been given for payments anticipated to be made by new development toward the cost of the improvements valorem taxes the impact fees imposed hereby will not be used to fund the portion of the cost of the improvements or other public facilities and services necessitated by or attributable to existing development within the city or to correct any existing deficiencies in public facilities and services within the city in any fashion whatsoever adoption of study the city hereby approves and adopts the impact fee study report and
