or protect the existing visual environment would be visually affected by the required bufferyard i a proposed development which by virtue of the characteristics of its structures indicates innovation of design a unique relationship with the site represents a focal point establishes a particular identifying element for the locale ii a proposed development which exhibits innovative or unique uses of site landscaping or which combines in the use of the site open recreational areas such as described above c retention of existing natural attributes of the site in this case significant steps must be taken by a developer to preserve significant tree stands topographic characteristics even in the event that such elements are in locations where they are not wholly visible the intent is to provide incentives to retain the features of the existing natural environment rather than encourage its destruction and then to remedy the situation with new plantings d management of existing and proposed

of permissible uses the letter p means that the use is permissible in the indicated zone with a zoning permit issued by the administrator the letters  se mean a special exception permit must be obtained from the board of zoning appeals reserved permissible uses and specific exclusions a the presumption established by this zoning ordinance is that all legitimate uses of land in the town are provided for within at least one zoning district in the towns planning jurisdiction because the list ofpermissible uses set forth in the table of permissible uses cannot be all inclusive those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses vir  b notwithstanding a all uses that are not listed in the table ofpermissible uses even given the liberal interpretation mandated by a are prohibited nor shall the table of permissible uses be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is permissible in another district or districts c the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts i any use that involves the manufacture handling sale distribution or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials ii stockyards slaughterhouses rendering plants iii use of a travelmobile trailer as a temporary or permanent residence iv use of a motor vehicle parked on a lot as a structure in which out ofwhich or from which any goods are sold or stored any services are performed or other business is conducted zoning town ofindian head maryland 10 1 accessory uses a the table of permissible uses classifies different principal uses according to their different impacts whenever an activity which may or may not be separately listed as a principal use in this table is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use i constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or ii is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a swimming pooltennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multi family development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed apart from a residential development would require a special exception permit use classification  b the following activities so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses i offices or studios within an enclosed building and used by an occupant of a residence located on the same lot as such building to carry on administrative or artistic activities so long as such activities do not fall within the definition of a home occupation ii hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature iii the renting out ofone or two rooms within a single family residence which one or two rooms do not themselves constitute a separate dwelling unit to not more than two persons who are not part of the family that resides in the singlefamily dwelling iv yard sales or garage sales so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot for more than three days whether consecutive or not during any 90 day period c storage outside of a substantially enclosed structure of any motor vehicle that is neither licensed nor operational shall not be regarded as accessory to a residential principal use and is prohibited in residential districts permissible uses not requiring permits notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter no zoning or special exception permit is necessary for the following uses i streets ii electric power telephone telegraph cable television gas water and sewer lines wires or pipes together with supporting poles or structures located within a public rightofway zoning of indian head 102 iii neighborhood utility facilities located within a public rightofway with the permission of the owner state or town of the rightofway change in use a a substantial change in use ofproperty occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes this occurs whenever i the change involves a change from one principal use category to another ii the original use is a combination use or planned development and the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or planned development use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered iii the original use is a combination use or planned development use and the mixture of types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use or planned development use changes iv the original use is a planned residential development and the relative proportions of different types of dwelling units change v there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot regardless of whether that business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or a combination ofuses and that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type ofbusiness for example if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within principal use classification 2 111 however if the florist shop were replaced by another florist shop that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed moreover if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot shopping center  combination use has not changed b a mere change in the status ofproperty from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two active uses of the property without regard to any intervening period during which the property may have been unoccupied unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 consecutive days or has been abandoned c a mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in the name shall not be regarded as a change in use zoning of indian head 103 combination uses a when a combination use comprises two or more principal uses that require different types of permits zoning or special exception then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be i a special exception permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a special  exception permit ii a zoning permit in all other cases b when a combination use consists of a singlefamily detached architecturally integrated subdivision and twofamily or multi family uses then the total density permissible on the entire tract shall be determined by dividing the area of the tract by the minimum square footage per dwelling unit specified in more specific use controls whenever a development could fall within more than one use classification in the table of permissible uses the classification that most closely and most specifically describes the development controls for example a small doctors office or clinic clearly falls within the 3 110 classification office and service operations conducted entirely indoors and designed to attract customers or clients to the premises however classification 3 130  office or clinics of physicians or dentists with not more than 10000 square feet of gross floor area more specifically covers this use and therefore is

meets the bufferyard requirements of this the existing use may enter into agreements with abutting landowners to use its existing buffer to provide some or all of the required bufferyard of both land uses the total buffer shall equal the requirements of this that such an agreement can be negotiated the initial use may provide the second use some or all of its required bufferyard andor extra land on which it might develop the existing use may reduce its excess buffer by transferring part or all ofthe excess buffer to the adjoining landowner to serve as its buffer any remaining excess buffer areamaybe used by the existing use for expansion ofthat use or for transfer by it to the adjoining landowner to expand that adjoining use contractual reduction of bufferyards when a land use is proposed adjacent to vacant land and the owner ofthat vacant land enters into a contractual relationship with the owner ofthe land that is to be developed first a reduced buffer may be provided by that first use provided that the contract contains a statement by the owner ofthe vacant land of an intent to develop at no greater than a specified land use intensity class  and an agreement by that vacant landowner to assume all responsibility for additional buffer ifneeded by the subsequent development of a less intense use than had been agreed upon is transferred to the owner ofthe vacant second in time to be developed land shading town findings and declaration of policy shade trees a the town finds that i trees are proven producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival ii trees appreciably reduce the ever increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe zoning town ofindian head maryland 18 4 iii trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the air washer devices used on commercial air conditioning systems b iv trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers v trees root systems play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control vi trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land particularly parking areas and vii for the reasons indicated in trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values based upon the findings set forth in  a the town declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health safety and welfare of all persons living or working within the towns planning jurisdiction to protect certain existing trees and under the circumstances set forth in this article to require the planting ofnew trees in certain

landscaping e 1 guide for protecting existing trees provides for the retention and protection of large trees when land is developed to better ensure the survival of existing trees the developer should heed the following guidelines in addition to the mandatory requirements of  1 protect trees with fencing and armoring during the entire construction period the fence should enclose an area 10 feet square with the tree at the center 2 avoid compaction ofthe soil around existing trees due to heavy equipment do not pile dirt or other materials beneath the crown of the tree 3 keep fires or other sources of extreme heat well clear of existing trees 4 repair damaged roots and branches immediately exposed roots should be covered with topsoil severed limbs and roots should be painted wherever roots are destroyed a proportional amount ofbranches must be pruned so the tree doesnt transpire more water than it takes in injured trees must be thoroughly watered during the ensuing growing year 5 prune all existing trees that will be surrounded by paving to prevent dehydration e2 standards for street and parking lot trees trees planted in compliance with the requirements of shall have most or all of the following qualities the trees recommended in represent the best combinations of these characteristics 1 hardiness a resistance to extreme temperatures b resistance to drought c resistance to storm damage d resistance to air pollution e ability to survive physical damage from human activity 2 life cycle a moderate to rapid rate of growth b long life 3 foliage and branching a tendency to branch high above the ground b wide spreading habit appendix e april 2004 indian head zoning c relatively dense foliage for maximum shading 4 maintenance a resistance to pests b resistance to plant diseases c little or no pruning requirements d no significant litter problems e3 formula for calculating 20 percent shading of vehicle accommodation areas the following is an elementary formula for determining the number of shade trees required in and around paved parking lots in order to presumptively satisfy the shading requirements of  including parking spaces driveways loading areas sidewalks and other circulation areas and not including building area or any area which will remain completely undeveloped calculate square footage of the vehicle accommodation area sqfeet  2 multiply

area shaded by required street trees if any sq feet  7 subtotal   sqfeet  if line 7 is greater than line 3 then the shading requirement has been met if not go to line 8 8 enter the difference between line 7 and line 3 sqfeet  9 divide line 8  707 10 total number of shade trees required within the vehicle accommodation area trees existing trees retained in compliance with will be credited according to their actual crown radius shaded area may be calculated as follows 3 14 x crown radius2  shaded area appendix e april2004 indian head zoning trees planted within the vehicle accommodation area are credited with shading 707 square feet based on a crown radius of 15 feet new or existing trees on the perimeter of the parking lot are credited for having only half a crown over the vehicle accommodation area  eg new perimeter trees will be credited for shading 354 square feet generally all trees planted in compliance with the screening requirements of the street tree requirements of will be considered perimeter trees when smaller trees such as dogwoods are planted the credited shading area will be adjusted downward to 314 square feet for interior trees and 157 square feet for perimeter trees  based on a crown radius of 10 feet e4 typical parking lot planting islands appendix e indian head zoning april 2004 e5 guide for planting trees the trees recommended in have minimal maintenance requirements however all trees must receive a certain degree of care especially during and immediately after planting to protect an investment in new trees the developer should ensure that the following guidelines are followed when planting selection select trees well adapted to the microclimates of individual planting sites a poor tree match dooms the tree from the start no matter how much care is taken in planting planting times the best times for planting are early spring and early fall trees planted in the summer run the risk of dehydration drainage prior to planting test soil drainage if water does not drain out of a sample planting hole within a few hours consider installing drainage in the bottom of the hole to drain away excess water also consider raising or berming the planting site or adding several inches of good quality topsoil in the planting hole and the surrounding area but do not simply amend the soil in the planting hole  water movement will be detrimentally altered ifnone of the above is possible select a more water tolerant tree species  red maple sycamore bald cypress willow oak river birch etc  avoid trees like dogwoods that dont like  wet feet the planting hole the planting hole that is dug should be wide and shallow a flat pancakeshaped hole that approximates the shallow horizontal root growth that the tree will produce is recommended in average soil dig the hole only as deep as the root ball and in heavy clayy soil to enhance drainage dig the hole an inch or two shallow loose soil should not be put beneath the root ball in order to avoid having the tree end up planted too deep as the soil beneath it settles or compacts the exposed top of the ball can be covered with mulch whenever possible hole walls should gradually taper up to grade rather than being straight to more closely approximate where root growth will occur soil additives adding water absorbing polymers hydrogels super slupers etc to the backfill soil has not proven beneficial in the majority of the landscape research that has been conducted with regard to tree planting the same is true to adding organic amendments peatmoss compost etc in general the only substitute for backfilling with the existing soil unamended is backfilling with better quality topsoil planting near sidewalks driveways and other areas plant all trees at least 3 1 2 feet from the end of head in parking spaces to prevent damage from car overhangs when planting near sidewalks driveways and other areas where tree root surfacing can cause damage or be a maintenance problem consider installing one of the physical root redirecting barriers being marketed or try the herbicide treated landscape fabric now available for this purpose biobarrier no long term research has yet been published on the use of these tree redirecting materials so their long term effect on trees is not yet known balled and burlapped trees when planting balled and burlapped trees closely inspect the material used to wrap the root ball many synthetic materials nylons etc are being used as well as burlaps treated to retard their degradation when in doubt as to whether or not these materials appendix e april 2004 indian head zoning will degrade underground do not leave them intact remove the pinning nails or lacing and roll back the top several inches make vertical slits in several places around the ball you do not want a wrapping material that wont degrade to restrict root growth wire baskets research has shown that the wire baskets used to protect root balls whether galvanized or not are degrading only very slowly underground due to low oxygen no long term root girding or damage has been found however so it does not appear that the baskets need to be removed if the top loops of the wire basket will be at ground level or slightly above it will be advisable to remove this section to keep equipment from hanging up in the loops ropes be sure to remove all ropes whether jute or nylon that have been tied around the trunk again degradation is slow or nonexistent resulting in trunks being girded containers be sure to remove all plastic containers from the root balls of container grown or containerized trees if trees have been grown or potted into fiber pots break away the top several inches ofthe fiber pot many fiber pots are being coated with extra materials to extend their shelf life but this can slow degradation below ground and retard root extension root care in container plants when a container is removed if roots are found circling around the outside of the root ball cut them in a few places to remove the possibility of the curling root eventually girding the trunk select trees grown in pots with vertical ribs rather than ones with straight walls or horizontal ribs as the vertical ribs help reduce root circling fertilizer fertilizer can be added to the backfill ifit is a slow release form  osmocote woodace briquettes tree spikes etc the caution in the past against adding fertilizers at planting time was a result of not having slow release fertilizers available  agronomic fertilizers that were and still can be used in landscaping have the potential to burn and should not be added watering good followup watering is important to help establish a trees root system several water reservoir devices are available but may be too expensive or cumbersome to justify using mulching trees should be mulched but not over mulched when planted two or three inches of organic mulches such as shredded or chunk pine bark or inorganic mulches such as volcanic rock is adequate keep mulches from touching the trunks of trees with organic mulches excessive mulch piled against tree trunks can hold too much moisture against the bark and lead to disease problems it also may become a habitat for rodents that will feed on the bark with inorganic mulches if the tree is in a windy location and the trunk moves considerably the bark may become abrased by the inorganic mulch appendix e april 2004 indian head zoning landscape fabrics for weed control the use of black plastic beneath mulch around trees is not recommended because air and water exchange is blocked for added weed control try one of the landscape fabrics that has proven more weed root penetration resistant dalens weed x dewitts pro 5 weed barrier etc but do not pile too much mulch not over two inches atop the fabric or weeds will simply grow in the mulch layer tree staking dont automatically stake all trees especially small ones if a tree is in a windy location or has a crown stake for a maximum of one year try to stake so that the tree has a slight amount of flex rather than being held rigidly in place use guying or attaching material that will not damage the bark if the stakes are to be left in place longer than one year to serve as a barrier against equipment be sure to remove the guying to prevent trunk girding a variety ofprotective devices are available for trunk protection if that is an important consideration tree wraps the use of tree wraps and other protection materials that are applied directly to the trunk is currently under investigation if a material is applied paper fabric burlap strips etc remove it after one year if materials are wrapped onto the trunk wrap from the base of the tree upward so that water is shed off the wrap not funneled under it tags and labels remove tags and labels from the trees to prevent them from girding the trunk postplanting care conscientious postplanting care especially watering structural pruning and fertilizing

shrubs shrubs planted for screening purposes should be given a proper culture and sufficient room in which to grow many of the guidelines for tree planting listed in also apply to shrubs however because specific requirements vary considerably between shrub types this appendix does not attempt to generalize the needs of all shrubs for detailed planting information on individual species refer to manual of woody landscape plants by michael din e10 lists of recommended trees and shrubs the following lists indicate plantings which will meet the screening and shading requirements of of the development ordinance the lists are by no means comprehensive and are intended merely to suggest the types of flora which would be appropriate for screening and shading purposes plants were selected for inclusion on these lists according to four principal criteria  i general suitability for the climate and soil conditions of this area  ii ease of maintenance iii tolerance of urban conditions and iv availability from area nurseries when selecting new plantings for a particular site a developer should first consider the types of plants which are thriving on or near that site however if an introduced species has proven highly effective for screening or shading in this area it too may be a proper selection contain descriptions of some of the trees and shrubs listed here a small trees for partial screening 1 river birch 2 american hornbeam 3 eastern redbud 4 flowering dogwood 5 washington hawthorn 6 russian olive 7 mountain silverbell 8 american holly 9 golden rain tree 10 crape myrtle

winter honeysuckle 9 star magnolia 10 northern bayberry 11 judd viburnum 12 doublefile viburnum 11 april 2004 e 11 small trees for partial screening the following trees are recommended for use in all types of screens though smaller than the trees listed in planting lists e12 and e 13 each of these trees will reach a height of at least 20 feet 1 river birch betula nigra height 2040 feet  spread` 8 16 feet the river birch is a native tree which usually grows along stream banks in landscape design it is adaptable to either high or low locations but still requires a lot of moisture this tree has an interesting papery bark and a graceful branching habitat it has no special pest or maintenance problems 2 american hornbeam carpinus carolinia height 2030 feet  spread 15 20 feet this native tree has a natural yet refined appearance it is slow growing but at maturity it serves as an excellent small shade tree its fluted muscular trunk is an interesting feature in the wild the american hornbeam is common in moist rich soil yet when used in landscape design it is soil tolerant and does not require an unusual amount of water it has no pests and no special maintenance problems e12 large trees for evergreen screening the following trees are ideal for screening large scale areas such as shopping centers and industrial sites they are also effective in combination with other smaller screening plants both are moderate to fast growers they are not considered to be shade trees 1 deodar cedar cedrus deodara height 40 150 feet  spread 30 feet + the deodar cedar is a useful and attractive evergreen it should be allowed plenty ofroom in order to assume its beautiful natural form its pendulous branches should be allowed to touch the ground it prefers relatively dry soils grows rapidly and is easy to maintain true cedars such as the deodar are not native to north america but they have become quite popular in the south as a landscape tree 2 southern magnolia magnolia grandiflora height 40 60 feet  spread 25 feet + magnolias are striking trees which serve well as screens when their branches are allowed to grow to the ground generally this tree does well in city conditions but it should be planted in quite rich acidic soils and it requires a lot of moisture furthermore magnolias require ample space for growth if planted in full sunlight they will grow rapidly because it drops large waxy leaves seed pods and flowers the magnolia may present a litter problem e 13 large trees for shading the following trees may be used for screening but they are recommended especially for shading streets and parking lots unless otherwise noted they will grow rapidly each species will attain a mature spread of at least 30 feet 1 red maple acer rubrum height 4050 feet  spread 25 feet + this tree is an example of a maple which is not recommended where there will be high concentrations of air pollution however with its excellent shading characteristics and beautiful colors it should not be ignored this tree grows rapidly but unlike the norway maple it does not become brittle with age the red maple is a native tree which is usually found in moist even swampy areas but it adapts well appendix e april2004 indian head zoning to a variety of situations although subject to maple insects and diseases it is usually a longlived tree 2 honeylocust gleditisia triacanthos height 5075 feet  spread 25 feet + its open spreading form and feathery leaves may give the honeylocust a frail appearance but it is fact a quite sturdy tree notable for its resistance to storm damage it is a native tree which is drought resistant and adaptable to city conditions grass and shrubs thrive beneath a honeylocust because it casts light shade this tree is especially useful for its ability to be transplanted at a relatively advanced age accordingly it may be used for immediate effect in a landscape design the honeylocust has its pests and diseases but it is fairly hardy thornless and fruitless varieties such as  moraine are recommended e 14 small shrubs for evergreen screening the following shrubs are recommended for informal unclipped hedges or screens each species grows to a height of less than six feet  therefore these shrubs are appropriate for semiopaque screens 1 glossy abelia abelia grandiflora height 46 feet  spread 3 5 feet abelia is quite common in local nurseries and tends to be less expensive than other shrubs on this list it bears pale pink flowers throughout the summer although it has proven quite popular for informal hedges it has several drawbacks abelia should be pruned and thinned to maintain its best form it may drop its leaves due to low temperatures lack ofpruning or starvation 2 warty barberry berberis verruculosa height 3 4 feet  spread 3 4 feet barbenys as a group have proven to be excellent hedge plants with their dense spiny limbs they are effective barriers in public places the warty barberry is a shrub with a neat compact habit it is soil tolerant and has no special maintenance requirements it grows slowly but it will reach a height of three to four feet within five years e 15 large shrubs for evergreen screening the following shrubs are recommended for high hedges or screens each species grows to a height of more than six feet  therefore these shrubs are appropriate for opaque screens 1 hedge bamboo bambusa multiplex height 10 12 feet  spread 46 feet hedge bamboo grows rapidly yet is more easily confined to a limited area than most types ofbamboo it is adaptable to a variety of situations but requires plenty of water for best effect as a screen hedge bamboo should be stagger planted 2 thorny elaengus elaengus pungens height 8 10 feet  spread 6 10 feet this shrub tolerates many adverse conditions it will grow rapidly in relatively infertile dry soils its dense thorny branches form an excellent natural hedge it is one of the most common evergreen shrubs in the south appendix e april 2004 indian head zoning e16 assorted shrubs for broken screens the following is a sampling of shrubbery that would be appropriate in a broken screen because many of these plants are deciduous they are not suitable for opaque and semiopaque screens  note many of the evergreen shrubs described in planting lists b 14 and b 15 are also suitable for broken screens 1 japanese barberry berberis thunbergii height 3 5 feet  spread 3 5 feet this extremely common deciduous shrub is considered to be one of the toughest members of the barberry family it survives drought poor soils exposure and the worst city conditions with its many thorns the japanese barberry is often used as an impenetrable barrier but it is attractive enough to stand alone as a specimen plant it requires no special maintenance and when planted singly needs no pruning 2 fringetree chioanthus virginicus height 10 30 feet  spread 8 10 feet the fringetree is known for its profusion of beautiful flowers it is considered to be one of the most striking native american shrubs it is relatively difficult to transplant but once established it does well in cities as it endures heavy smoke and dust the mature fringetrees only drawback is that its leaves appear rather late in spring appendix e april 2004 indian head zoning appendix f bufferyard requirements f1 bufferyard specifications the following illustrations graphically indicate the specifications of each bufferyard bufferyard requirements are stated in terms of the width of the bufferyard and the number of plant units required per one hundred  100 linear feet of bufferyard the requirements of a bufferyard may be satisfied by any of the options thereof illustrated the  plant unit multiplier is a factor by which the basic number of plant materials required for a given bufferyard is determined given a change in the width of that yard the type and quantity of plant materials required by each bufferyard and each bufferyard option are specified in this section only those plant materials capable of fulfilling the intended function shall satisfy the requirements of this ordinance the options within any bufferyard are designed to be equivalent in terms of their effectiveness in eliminating the_ impact of adjoining uses cost equivalence between options was attempted where possible generally the plant materials which are identified as acceptable are determined by the types of soil present on the site the following illustrations have mathematically rounded the number of plant units required for each option within a given bufferyard in actual practice mathematical rounding would be applied to the total amount of plant material required by a bufferyard not to each one hundred  100 foot length of bufferyard all of the following illustrations are drawn to scale and depict the bufferyard according to the average projected diameter of plant materials at five 5 years after planting each illustration depicts the total bufferyard located between two uses whenever a wall fence or berm is required within a bufferyard these are shown as  structure required in the following illustrations wherein their respective specifications are also shown all required structures shall be the responsibility of the higher intensity use whenever a wall is required in addition to a berm the wall shall be located between the berm and the higher intensity use in order to provide maximum sound absorption f2 plant material the following plant material substitutions shall satisfy the requirements of this section 1 in bufferyards c d and e evergreen canopy or evergreen understory trees may be substituted for deciduous canopy forest trees without limitation 2 in bufferyards a and b evergreen canopy or evergreen understory trees may be substituted as follows a in the case of deciduous canopy forest trees up to a maximum of fifty 50 percent of the total number of the deciduous canopy trees otherwise required b in the case of deciduous understory without limitation 3 in all bufferyards evergreen or conifer shrubs may be substituted for deciduous shrubs without limitation 4 in all bufferyards required of public service uses the public service use may substitute evergreen canopy or evergreen understory plant materials for canopy forest trees and understory plant materials without limitation if the development on the adjoining use is existing planned or deed restricted for solar access appendix f indian head zoning april 2004 understory trees may be substituted for canopy trees where canopy trees would destroy solar access any existing plant material which otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section may be counted toward satisfying all such requirements the exact placement of required plants and structures shall be the decision of each user except that the following requirements shall be satisfied 1 evergreen  or conifer class iii and iv plant materials shall be planted in clusters rather than singly in order to maximize their chances of survival 2 berms with masonry walls bwi bw2 and bw3 required of bufferyard d and e options are intended to buffer more significant nuisances from adjacent uses and additionally to break up and absorb noise which is achieved by the varied heights of plant materials between the masonry wall and the noise source a when berms with walls are required the masonry wall shall be closer than the berm to the higher intensity use b within a bufferyard a planting area at least five  5 feet wide containing fifteen 15 percent of the total plant requirements  based on the multiplier   1 shall be located between the masonry wall and the higher intensity class use these plants shall be chosen to provide species and sizes to reduce noise in conjunction with the wall all bufferyard areas shall be seeded with lawn unless ground cover is already established f3 structures the following structures are equivalent and may be used interchangeably so long as both structures
