the provisions of this chapter constitute changes or modifications in the requirements contained in health and safety the city council does hereby find that such changes and modifications are reasonably necessary because of local conditions prevailing within the city of larkspur a description of said local conditions is hereinafter set forthclimatic the weather patterns within the city of larkspur are considered to be moderately affected by the pacific ocean and the san francisco bay which extends the yearround growing season of vegetation the normal years rainfall is approximately 28 inches while the summer condition with its prevalent pacific high cell creates the morning and late afternoon fog normally associated with the san francisco bay while normal temperatures usually do not exceed 7580 degrees during the summer months little or no rain falls during the period between april and november this combination often creates hazardous fuel conditions in the city drying winds in the summer and fall months reduce fuel moisture and relative humidity to the minimum levels thereby creating ideal fire weather conditions the normal afternoon winds that precede the fog can move a fire quickly in the hillside and open space areas of the city because of climatic conditions the county of marin has experienced water rationing in recent years including a mandatory 35 percent reduction in 1989 water shortages can be expected in future years due to limited storage capacities in marin increased domestic consumption and weather patterns that reduce the already minimal annual rainfall while sound management of the water resources is possible actual demands on an already stressed water supply can most assuredly be predicted geologic the city of larkspur is geologically mixed with three classifications of rock igneous metamorphic and sedimentary the outstanding material is volcanic in origin with ridges of serpentine reaching in excess of 700 feet in elevation much of the city is characterized by precipitous hilly areas where escape opportunities from residential structures are limited to one side of the home only the steepness and uneven nature of the land often hinders and sometimes prevents the erecting of rescue ladders at the side of a home on a hillside parcel seismic activity within the city occurs yearly with little or no damage although a real potential does exist with the city situated between two active faults the san andreas and hayward faults landslides have also been experienced in the city in recent years while stabilization of hillsides can sometimes be achieved heavy rainfalls have caused failures these slides can close roadways making accessibility to many locations in the city impossible until properly cleared topographic the city is accessible from the outside by one primary thoroughfare on the east side and three on the west side speed limits of 25 miles per hour by virtue of the narrow and twisting configuration of the roads do not allow quick responses to emergencies the highway 101 corridor goes directly city and an overpass that may or may not withstand an earthquake presents another problem vehicular access within the city is affected by steep hilly terrain and many secondary ridgelines many streets are narrow and winding restricting the speed at which fire apparatus may safely respond and also increasing the time lapse between fire detection and apparatus arrival during which time a family will face the fire or other emergency on their own the city has many deadend streets and in madrone canyon there is one main access route in or out of the area deadend streets can restrict the ease of relocating fire and rescue equipment from one location to another even though actual separating distance between two areas may be minimal in addition to restricting access routes for fire apparatus the deadend streets also limit egress opportunities for residents many of the commercial buildings in larkspur were largely built long before present code requirements existed consequently many of these structures do not meet even minimal standards for fire protection and life safety wood frame construction of older buildings especially those in mountainous areas creates an adverse exposure problem not only in being easily ignited by an adjacent structure fire but also in contributing to the extension of fire to other buildings actual physical heat conduction and flying embers fire history in the city has shown flying embers will start secondary fires after blowing in the air throughout the city there are areas in which there are no water mains constructed at all meadow valley has no water main supply other than domestic and there is minimal water supply along casa buena drive fronting the auto dealerships and the other major commercial establishments the buildings on christmas tree hill many of which were constructed 50 or more years ago are serviced by minimal water main sizes the lack of adequate water supply in this area along with winding streets creates a unique fire problem the generalized water shortage in marin county results in occasional inadequate water volume and pressure for firefighting purposes in certain areas of the city 10 2018    appeals whenever the fire disapproves an application or refuses to grant a permit applied for or when it is

floodplain management regulations bfindings of fact 1the flood hazard areas of the city of larkspur are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to the flood loss cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4minimize prolonged business interruptions  5minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains  electric telephone and sewer lines  and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  7ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions dmethods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to 1restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters

1993  variance procedure anature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can properly be granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bappeal board 1in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the adanger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  bdanger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  csusceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  dimportance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  enecessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  favailability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  gcompatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  hrelationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  isafety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  jexpected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and kcosts of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that athe issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and bsuch construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the marin county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration and federal emergency management agency cconditions for variances 1generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of larkspur municipal have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in larkspur municipal  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5variances shall only be issued upon a ashowing of good and sufficient cause  bdetermination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in larkspur municipal  to the applicant  and cdetermination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in larkspur municipal see public safety and

deny the permit application 12 2018  part 1992  required findings to approve the circulation assessment permit the planning commission must make finding a of this section that the project is consistent with the larkspur general plan and must make at least one additional finding from findings b c d e or f as listed in this section athe project is consistent with the larkspur general plan and as applicable with the downtown specific plan or other specific plans bthe projects projected peak hour trip generation will not exceed the average existing peak hour trip generation which results when the trip generation rates as described in the ite trip generation manual are applied to the existing use on the project site cthe projects traffic when added to the existing traffic plus projected traffic will not cause the performance of intersections or roadway linkages to fall below acceptable level of service standards or otherwise significantly further reduce the system performance if it is already below the acceptable level of service nor will it cause a significant degradation in service levels for impacted intersections at their peak traffic periods significant intersection service level degradation is defined as an increase of 001 or more in the peak hour volume to capacity vc ratio as calculated under the planning procedures for signalized intersections in the transportation research circular 212 dthe agreement by the project sponsor to provide the project specific transportation system improvements as may be required by the city and to pay traffic impact fees as described in larkspur municipal 15 which will provide the projects proportionate share of the funds necessary to construct the transportation improvements as shown on the programmed transportation improvements list will adequately mitigate the projects adverse impacts ethe projects peak hour traffic will not increase the traffic volume on any roadway segment or intersection approach of the citys primary circulation system by more than one percent of the existing traffic volume or by more than ten 10 vehicles whichever is less fthe project will provide an overriding public benefit that will sufficiently offset its adverse traffic impacts any affirmative decision of the planning commission or the city council based upon this finding must be approved by a fourfifths majority the grounds for making this finding must be set forth in the approving motion 12 2018  part 1992 traffic impact fee intent and purpose  additional findings  terms and definitions  applicability  rate of fee  calculation of fee  payment of fee  use of funds  refunds  appeals  supplementary provisions  severability  posting  intent and purpose the city council of the city of larkspur finds that as a result of increasing regional growth significant residential commercial office and industrial development is expected to occur within the city this anticipated development including development currently approved or submitted for approval cumulatively will generate a substantial increase over existing levels of traffic within the city this increase in traffic will result in traffic volumes which exceed the capacity of the existing citywide transportation system to provide acceptable levels of service the city council also finds that unless certain actions are taken the above factors will result in adverse impacts such as unacceptable levels of congestion on streets and at intersections traffic accidents air pollution noise and restrictions on access for emergency vehicles to prevent these undesirable consequences the capacity of the citywide transportation system must be expanded at a rate which will accommodate the expected growth in the city the city council also finds that in the absence of this ordinance imposing a traffic impact fee existing and future sources of revenue will be inadequate to fund a substantial portion of the improvements required to meet the goals objectives policies and programs identified in the transportation element of the general plan accordingly it is the intent of the city council to adopt by this chapter a fair and equitable method of securing some of the revenues necessary to fund the construction and implementation of improvements to the citywide transportation system sufficient to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by new development at acceptable levels of service throughout the city this chapter is adopted pursuant to and to comply with government et seq it is also the intent of the city council that the adoption of this chapter will assist the city to meet the goals of the larkspur general plan including but not limited to preserving the historic character of the community and avoiding the disruption of neighborhoods from 12 2018  part 1992  additional findings the city council further finds as follows athe land use element of the larkspur general plan specifies the permitted uses of land within the city and places limits on the intensity and density of such use bthe city council has examined the relationship between the land uses and densities permitted under the general plan and the downtown specific plan based upon this examination the city council has identified trends in growth and development which enable the city council to project with substantial certainty the magnitude and extent of future development based upon the citys general plan and downtown specific plan cthe city council also has examined the extent to which different land uses generate vehicle trips the city council in evaluating these trip generation rates has taken into consideration among other things the general plan technical studies the citywide traffic study and various reports and memorandums by staff and consultants regarding trip generation rates the city council finds that these trip generation rates represent a reasonable estimate of the actual trip generation rates for these land use categories dthe city has identified certain major street and interchange improvements transit way projects and other trafficrelated improvements which are necessary or appropriate to accommodate the new development described in the citys general plan the larkspur general plan and the citywide traffic study indicate that buildout of the development permitted under the general plan will result in unacceptable levels of service at many of the key intersections identified in the report the city council finds that this level of congestion will have adverse effects throughout the city and that implementation of the transportation element will substantially reduce these adverse effects efull implementation of the transportation element will require the construction of major improvements to the existing citywide transportation system the city council has after review of all relevant information determined the estimated reasonable cost of those improvements and estimated funds available to make such improvements as well as the extent to which funding is inadequate to make the necessary improvements fthe city council in determining the extent to which funds are available to make transportation improvements has evaluated present and future sources of federal state and county funding city revenues which are earmarked for transportation improvements and the extent to which committed projects are required to construct or fund transportation improvements that will assist in the implementation of the transportation element the city is committed to actively pursuing all available funding sources for transportation improvements in cooperation with interested members of the development community galthough the traffic volume generated by an individual development project may not be in and of itself sufficient to overload the existing citywide transportation system the cumulative impact of all new development permitted under the citys general plan including development currently approved or submitted for approval will result in unacceptable levels of congestion implementation of the transportation element will result in a significant reduction in the level of traffic congestion generated by new development it is the policy of the city as set forth in the transportation element that new development pay for the cost of the improvements to the citywide transportation system which are identified in the transportation element and the citywide traffic study and are necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by new development for these reasons a fair and equitable method of securing some of the revenues necessary to construct the required transportation improvements is to impose a traffic impact fee based on the extent to which new development generates additional traffic volumes hthe transportation improvements will be constructed or implemented with funds generated by this chapter and will significantly benefit the contributor in that the adverse impacts such as noise air pollution delay accidents increased fuel consumption harm to the local economy and inconveniences caused by traffic congestion will be substantially mitigated the inability or failure to reduce the adverse impacts caused by traffic congestion in all parts of the city will have adverse effects throughout the city ithe city council further finds that all portions of the existing local street system except as noted below currently operate at acceptable service levels the funds collected under this chapter shall be exclusively used to mitigate the impacts of the trips generated by new development within the city the following intersections have been identified as currently operating below acceptable service levels and in accord with the policies of the general plan will not be improved in order to resolve the existing congestion problems 1sir francis drake boulevard at eliseo drive 2sir francis drake boulevard at la cuesta drive 3sir francis drake boulevard at bon air road jthe city council further finds that the traffic fees to be charged pursuant to this chapter do not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of implementing the transportation element that implementation of the transportation element is necessary to reduce the traffic congestion which will be created by new development and that the method of allocation adopted by this chapter which is based upon the trip generation rates for the land uses permitted under the citys general plan assures that the fee applicable to a particular development bears a fair and reasonable relationship to each such developments burden on and benefit from the citywide transportation improvements to be funded by this chapter kperiodic review and possible revision of the resolutions adopted by the city council pursuant to this chapter will allow for the adjustment of the fees to be paid under this chapter to ensure that those fees are fair and equitable and that the traffic fees imposed pursuant to this chapter continue to reflect the reasonable cost of implementing the transportation element 12 2018  part 1992  terms and

purpose the city is situated among a group of major and minor hills and ridges these constitute a significant natural topographical feature of the community because they are visible to all persons traveling the major arteries leading north county as well as to citizens residing in and around the community the migration of substantial numbers of persons to this area and the attendant technological amenities required to serve that population have not as yet detrimentally impinged upon all of the hills however in order to ensure the preservation of most of the hills ridges and ridgelines and their natural features a more harmonious visual and functional relationship is required between the existing natural environment and the growing manmade environment therefore it is the intent of the city to place land in hillside areas of a slope of ten 10 percent or greater under more restrictive regulations than those normally required for flat land development also refer to residential floor ratios in larkspur municipal  in order to accomplish one or more of the following ato preserve significant features of a sloping and elevated hill area in essentially their natural state bto encourage in hill areas an alternative approach to conventional flat land practices of development cto minimize grading and cut and fill operations consistent with the retention of the natural character of the hill areas dto minimize the water runoff and soil erosion problems incurred in adjustment of the terrain in order to meet onsite and offsite development needs eto achieve in hill areas land use densities and lot sizes for the creation of new parcels lot line adjustments and multipleunit residential developments that are in keeping with the general plan and retain the significant natural features of the hill areas note the land use densities and lot size regulations of this chapter are not intended to apply to new singlefamily homes built on existing legally created parcels or to the merger of existing legally created substandard size parcels both of which are subject to other provisions of the zoning ordinance and larkspur municipal  fto ensure that hillside land characterized by soil and other subsurface conditions having unstable characteristics be identified and that this factor be taken into account before the issuance of any permits required by this chapter gto ensure that the city does not incur any inordinate increase in the cost of providing or maintaining public services and that any increase in the cost of supplying or maintaining public services would not significantly weaken the citys financial position hto preserve the predominant views both from and of the hill areas and to retain the sense of identity and image that these hill areas now impart to the city and its environs 12 2018    part 1973  definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following words and phrases are defined as follows contour interval means the

calculations each area so excluded must be delineated using five 5 or fewer straight lines and may in addition include the property lines bif the owner makes this election the following requirements apply 1the land excluded from calculation must remain undeveloped and a deed restriction assuring this provision in a form acceptable to the city must be recorded 2only twenty 20 percent of the
