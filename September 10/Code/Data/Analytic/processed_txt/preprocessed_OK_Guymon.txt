fact a the flood hazard areas of the community are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 1080  487 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 1080  487 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  or 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 1080  487 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to

zoning district category that provides an alternate approach to conventional land use controls the pud may be used for particular tracts or parcels of land that are under common ownership and are to be developed as one unit according to a master development plan the pud is subject to special review procedures and once approved by the city council it becomes a special zoning classification for the property it represents 1410 intent and purpose the intent and purpose of the planned unit development provisions are to a encourage innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitations on the character and intensity of use assuring compatibility with adjoining and proximate properties and following the guidelines of the comprehensive plan  b permit flexibility within the development to maximize the unique physical features of the particular site  c encourage efficient use of land facilitate economic arrangement of buildings and circulation systems and encourage diversified living environments and land uses  d achieve a continuity of function and design within the development and to encourage diversified living environments and land uses  and e provide a vehicle for negotiating modifications in standard development requirements in order to both encourage innovative development and protect the health safety and welfare of the community 1411 planned unit development authorized a pud may be authorized by an amendment to the official zoning districts map after public hearings by the planning commission and city council provided it complies with the following requirements a locations and uses a pud shall be considered a special zoning districts  and it may be authorized for any use or combination of uses permitted in this chapter b planned unit development master plan required 1 the basis for review and approval of a pud application shall be the pud master plan which shall be adopted as a part of the ordinance of rezoning in conformance with the requirements described in these regulations 2 for a simplified pud the pud master plan shall be the simplified pud application to be provided by the building inspector a simplified pud is one which complies with the following a it is for a single tract or parcel or land that is no more than two 2 acres in size  and 48 b it is governed by the regulations of only one conventional zoning district  and c the use regulations of the conventional zoning district are modified only to decrease not increase the number of allowed uses permitted conditional special exception and special permit uses  and d the development regulations of the conventional zoning district are modified only to make them more restrictive not less restrictive a site plan may be required by the building inspector if it is deemed necessary to effectively review the application for all other puds the pud master plan shall consist of two 2 elements the design statement and the master development plan map c effect of planned unit development approval 1 approval of a zoning change to pud adopts the master plan prepared by the applicant and reviewed as a part of the application the master plan establishes new and specific requirements for amount and type of land use residential densities development regulations and location of specific elements of the development such as open space and screening 2 the pud classification replaces any previous zoning district classification of a parcel 3 where there is no provision in the pud master plan for special development regulations the requirements of the most restrictive conventional zoning district in which a proposed use or a structure is permitted shall be applied to the development 1412 criteria for planned unit development review and approval a purpose because the pud provides the opportunity for higher densities greater design flexibility mixed land uses and improved marketability the applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and services that might not be required or possible in a conventional development review and approval of a pud is therefore a process of negotiation between the city government and the applicant to achieve the intents and purposes of these regulations and the comprehensive plan the following factors should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a pud application other factors not listed herein may also be considered in the review process in order to respond to specific design and land use proposals b design standards 1 the proposed pud shall be designed to provide for the unified development of the area in accordance with the spirit and purpose of the comprehensive plan and the land uses and zoning districts adjacent to it 2 design of the pud may provide for modification of conventional zoning ordinance requirements for such elements as yard areas densities setback and height on individual lots in accordance with the pud master plan 49 3 density land use and intensity of use requirements shall be based on the pud master plan and shall be reviewed carefully for conformance to the comprehensive plan 4 building code requirements shall not be reduced in the design of a pud 5 the maximum number of dwelling units within a pud shall be based on calculation of gross density gross density shall be established in the pud master plan and shall be calculated by dividing the total land area to be developed for residential uses exclusive of arterial streets by the number of dwelling units 6 location and type of housing shall be established in a general pattern and shown on the master development plan map c minimum design and construction standards for streets and alleys streets and alleys for both urban and nonurban puds shall be designed and constructed in accordance with city standards and specifications for rightofway width curbs gutters paving and paving cross sections  provided that modifications may be requested and approved as a part of the master plan if the following criteria are met 1 public streets and alleys proposed public street and alley modifications shall satisfy the following criteria a street rightofway and paving widths shall be adequate to provide a traffic carrying and utility installation capacity related to the design of the overall street system the function of the individual street and the land uses served b paving cross sections shall be designed to be adequate to provide acceptable drainage in conformity with the drainage plan for the pud  to receive loading commensurate with anticipated traffic based on the design of the overall street system  and to have a maintenance level commensurate with that of facilities constructed to regular standards 2 private streets and alleys proposed private street and alley modifications shall satisfy the criteria for public facility modifications listed above and the following a private streets shall not be connected to an adjacent parcel which is not a part of the pud in a manner that will circulate traffic into and private street system b the ownerapplicant shall clearly demonstrate the existence and capabilities of a property owners association to provide the ongoing and long term maintenance of the private street and alley facilities that will not be provided by the city d general design and development guidelines 1 densities proposed residential densities should conform to density guidelines in the comprehensive plan and should be allocated in a manner and at a scale that will be compatible with adjacent developed neighborhoods 50 2 amenities amenities should be considered as an important justification for development and city approval of a pud where gross or net densities are to be increased to promote economy of development or where other methods of land use intensification are proposed usable open space should be furnished along with provision for its permanent retention and continued maintenance sidewalks and pedestrian ways should be planned where it is necessary to provide for amenity and public safety 3 streets a street design should be innovative and should restrict from residential areas as much as possible b encouragement should be given to design of short local streets serving limited areas such as the residential culdesac reduction of conventional minor street design widths should be considered appropriate on such streets when they are designed with limited length and only one access point c reduction of design widths on streets designed in a conventional pattern should not be approved d development of a private street system should be considered appropriate under certain conditions where there is no however a private street system should not serve as a reason for reduction of minimum design and paving standards e onstreet parking bays or other similar areas where vehicles must be backed into the traffic flow should not be approved on arterial or collector streets or any local street  provided however that certain culdesac or small loop street designs may be considered as appropriate 4 relationship to abutting uses a the master development plan map should show graphically the treatments that will be employed to separate the pud from abutting properties including commitments to landscaping screening earth berms or similar techniques b it is appropriate to specifically establish areas with height limitations where a transition to more intense uses is proposed or where a higher intensity development is proposed to abut a lower intensity area 5 mixed land use developments where a pud proposes a mix of uses which would generally be incompatible with a conventional development the pud master plan should specifically establish appropriate guidelines to assure a harmonious development 6 common access in commercial or industrial developments the pud master plan should establish specific standards and locations for common access driveways both within the development and abutting arterial streets approval of the bonus provisions in this chapter for shared parking facilities should only be authorized in a pud where this access commitment is provided in the pud master plan 51 142 pud application and review procedures 1420 planned unit development submission requirements a the developer of a pud shall follow a fivestep application and review procedure 1 optional preapplication review 2 application for rezoning submission of pud master plan including the design statement and master development plan map 3 preliminary plat where required by

before the following step is reviewed where appropriate other methods authorized in the subdivision regulations may be substituted in steps 3 and 4 above the planning commission and city council may however review more than one step at the same public hearing the final plat however shall be considered at a separate hearing c public hearings 1 public hearings shall be held on the application for rezoning and the pud master plan in accordance with regular procedures for zoning applications established in zoning public hearings on required plats shall be held in accordance with regular procedures established in the zoning in the subdivision regulations 1421 planned unit development review procedures a step 1 preapplication review prior to submission of an application for rezoning to a planned unit development the applicant should discuss with the building inspector the procedure for adopting a planned unit development and the requirements for the general layout of major roadways and utilities access to arterials or general design and narrative the availability of existing services and similar matters the building inspector shall also advise the applicant where appropriate to discuss the proposed planned unit development with those officials who must eventually approve the various aspects of the proposal coming within their jurisdiction the intent of the preapplication review is to expedite the mandatory design review process and to facilitate the approval of a pud master plan b step 2 application for rezoning and pud master plan 1 the pud application for rezoning submitted with a request for annexation or otherwise shall be filed in accordance with the zoning on application forms of the city of guymon the pud master plan which is submitted with the application for rezoning shall consist of a design statement and a master development plan map the applicant shall also provide other supporting maps as necessary to meet the submission requirements of this section 52 a the master development plan map shall be a graphic representation of the development plan for the area prepared at a scale appropriate for the size of the project but no less than the minimum required for preliminary plats in the subdivision regulations the purpose of the map is to conceptually portray the development commitments described in the pud design statement it is not a
