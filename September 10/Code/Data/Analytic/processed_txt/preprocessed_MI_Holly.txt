a bypass is prohibited by an industrial user and the superintendent may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless athe bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage for this section severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
