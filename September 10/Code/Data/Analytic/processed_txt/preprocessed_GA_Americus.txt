resources with significant development constraints due to flooding erosion and soils limitations in their natural state wetlands serve man and nature they provide habitat for fish wildlife and vegetation  water quality maintenance and pollution control  flood control erosion control  natural resource education scientific study  and open space and recreational opportunities in addition the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic wellbeing of many communities within the state b necessity to protect nationally a considerable number of wetland resources have been lost or impaired by draining dredging filling excavating building pollution and other acts damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare it is therefore necessary to discourage development activities that may adversely affect wetlands by ensuring maximum protection for wetlands located in the corporate limits of the city c purpose the purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection while taking into account varying ecological economic development recreational and aesthetic values activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to

purpose this article shall establish the stormwater utility enterprise fund all monies deposited into this fund shall be held in trust and expended solely for the purposes and uses set forth in this article  findings of fact the mayor and city council make the following findings of fact 1 the city of americus is authorized by the georgia constitution of 198 including without limitation paragraphs i and iii thereof and ocga  368262 to provide stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the city of americus hereinafter the city or americus and to collect fees for provision of those services 2 in promulgating the regulations contained in this section americus is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution and laws of the state of georgia and its city charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city limits 3 failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff a may cause erosion of lands threaten businesses and residences and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers streams and other bodies of water within and downstream of the city b failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the city thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system c failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the potential degradation of the quality of both surface water and groundwater resources 4 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and the additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city in order to do so the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainagerelated capital improvement needs 5 the city desires to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality and quantity to mitigate the impacts of pollution and flooding which may impact the public municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 private property and downstream receiving waters of the state of georgia andor united states therefore it is appropriate for the city to establish a stormwater utility and impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge directly or indirectly into the public ms4 and stormwater conveyance system whether the property is private or public in nature 6 compliance with applicable regulatory obligations including but not limited to the citys npdes wastewater discharge permit the comprehensive plan and the citys watershed protection plan as well as other identified stormwater management program needs will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for stormwater quality management drainage system maintenance floodplain management capital drainage projects and other program activities 7 the cost of operating and maintaining the citys stormwater management system and the funding of necessary repairs replacements improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the services received from the citys stormwater management program and the demand imposed by improved property on the citys drainage system and stormwater management program 8 the professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the citys consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the citys stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy 9 given the stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater management services systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs 10 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and waterbodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the city 11 the stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs and risk exposure it is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners andor tenants of improved properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the citys stormwater management systems and facilities which result in services to such properties and the owners andor tenants thereof the fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the stormwater user fee charge should correlate to the stormwater management services provided to that property and the runoff demand that the property imposes on the public drainage system and the city stormwater management program 12 the stormwater management needs in the city include but are not limited to protection of the public health safety and welfare of the community provision of stormwater management services renders andor results in both a service to customers and at least some benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways although the benefits may be indirect or immeasurable 13 a stormwater management program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city and the most equitable means to implement an enhanced level of service for stormwater management within the city user fees development permits and inspection fees and other mechanisms 14 the presence and amount of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future to that property such that the amount of impervious surface on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge therefore the city deems it appropriate to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge directly or indirectly into the public drainage system whether the property is private or public in nature 15 a schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based primarily on the amount of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city stormwater utility user fee charges may be designed with specific modifiers to further enhance customer equity as well as customer understanding of the user fee charge rate structure while at the same time minimizing the citys customer account management and maintenance efforts 16 stormwater utility user fee charges may be supplemented by other funding which addresses specific needs including but not limited to special district service fees special assessments revenue bonds use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes splost and other forms of revenue as from time to time deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council 17 the existence of privately owned and maintained onsite stormwater control facilities activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the citys stormwater management program and the stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a credit and such credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems facilities activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the reduction and mitigation of the stormwater runoff impacts from the property 18 it is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services systems or facilities together with any other supplemental revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services systems or facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes and such proceeds of user fee charges and supplemental revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city of americus stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund in trust to be dispersed only for stormwater management capital improvements facilities and equipment operating and nonoperating costs lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes 19 in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the public the governing authority of americus hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund as the best available means of addressing the foregoing needs and legal requirements by means of a separate stormwater utility rate ordinance the city will enact a stormwater user fee rate structure in the future to establish stormwater utility user fee charge rates for the provision of stormwater management services  definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings

shall be based upon the total number of equivalent residential units erus associated with developed properties within the city each eru shall correspond to 3000 square feet of impervious surface gravel and compacted soil driveways parking areas and roads on private property will be considered impervious surface and included in the customers eru calculation because of the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials however the total surface area associated with these materials will be calculated at 85 percent of the total erus to reflect the hydrologic response characteristics of these materials application of the 85 percent factor to these materials is based on applicable literature sources and reference documents outlined herein e calculation of charges the periodic

charge amount to any eligible customer will be $200erumonth 3 if the sfr property has an impervious surface amount that exceeds 9000 square feet or three erus then a customer stormwater user fee bill will be calculated for the customer account using the nsfr user fee charge calculation approach outlined herein b nsfr customer class each nsfr customer shall be charged one eru for each 3000 square feet or increment thereof of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of erus for billing fractional erus will be rounded to one decimal place to establish the number of erus for billing each month c undeveloped land customer class undeveloped land shall be assigned zero erus and will not receive a stormwater user fee bill f stormwater user fee charges shall be billed on the customers monthly public utility bill except as stipulated below starting with the first billing cycle in june 2010 as provided in this article and the stormwater utility enterprise fund
