facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph 3 are met 3 a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall title 8144 demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and c the user has submitted the following information to the potw and treatment plant operator within twentyfour 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five 5 days i a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  ii the

for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards 6 users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails b prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the prohibitions in if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior title 8145 discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 for the purposes of this section a bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this section 3 a if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the potw at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible b a user shall submit oral notice to the city of an

days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the potw may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours 4 a bypass is prohibited and the potw may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  title 8146 ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and iii the user submitted notices as required under paragraph 3 of this section b the potw may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potw determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph 4a of this section 8174 system of charges all charges to users within and without the city shall assure that each recipient of waste treatment services will pay its fair share of the costs of

development b residentialagricultural district rathe purpose of the ra district is to create protect and maintain a living environment composed of single family detached dwellings on one acre or larger lots in areas now so developed and adjacent vacant areas likely to be so developed the essential characteristic of the ra district is rural with lot sizes sufficient for individual water and sewer facilities  however centralized water and sewer facilities are encouraged consideration must be given in this district to the efficient and economical extension of city services particularly into those areas near or adjacent to city boundaries c single family residence district r1the purpose of the r1 district is to provide a residential environment which is characterized by smaller lot sizes and somewhat higher density than that of the ra district this district is also characterized by yards and other amenities necessary to maintain quality singlefamily residential living homes in this district should be connected to city service  and curbs gutters and paved streets are desirable d twofamily dwelling district r2the purpose of the r2 district is to protect quiet residential areas now developed or developing while at the same time allowing a limited increase in population density this district is characterized by smaller title 1052 dwellings somewhat more compact and denser residential development and a higher volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic than are present in the ra and r1 districts e multiple residence district rmthe purpose of the rm district is to establish areas permitting a greater population density than is allowed in more restrictive districts while at the same time maintaining a residential environment consistent with such greater population density in general this district is located nearer the central part of the city in areas where such use has been established and along major arteries on the borders of neighborhoods f
