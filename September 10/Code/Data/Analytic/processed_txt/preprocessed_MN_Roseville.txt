the city council finds that a significant number of puppies and kittens sold at pet stores come from largescale commercial breeding facilities where the health and welfare of the animals are not adequately provided for  and the city council finds that the documented abuses endemic to mass breeding facilities include overbreeding  inbreeding  minimal to noexistent veterinary care  lack of adequate and nutritious food water and shelter  lack of socialization  lack of adequate space  lack of adequate exercise  no or limited screening of genetic diseases  inadequate transportation and shipping protocols of puppies and kittens  and indiscriminate disposal of breeding dogs and cats who have reached the end of their profitable breeding cycle  and the city council finds that inhumane conditions in mass breeding facilities lead to health and behavioral issues in the animals bred in those facilities which many consumers are unaware of when purchasing animals from pet stores due to both a lack of education on the issue and misleading tactics of pet stores in some cases these health and behavioral issues which may not present themselves until sometime after the purchase of the animals can impose exorbitant financial and emotional costs on consumers  and the city council finds that current federal and state regulations do not properly address the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores while the city of roseville does not possess adequate resources to safeguard the health and well being of dogs and cats at the point of sale  and the city council finds that due in large part to pet overpopulation numerous dogs and cats are euthanized restricting the retail sale of puppies and kittens is likely to increase demand from animal shelters and rescue organizations  and the city council finds that across the country thousands of independent pet stores as well as large chains operate profitably with a business model focused on the sale of pet services and supplies and not the sale of commercially bred dogs or cats many of these stores collaborate with local animal shelters and rescue organizations to offer space and support for showcasing adoptable homeless pets on their premises  and the city council finds that this not adversely impact consumers ability to obtain a dog or cat of their choice directly from an animal shelter or breedspecific rescue organization or from a breeder where the consumer can see directly the conditions in which the dogs or cats are bred or can confer directly with the breeder concerning those conditions  and the city council finds that it is in the best interest of the city of roseville to adopt reasonable regulations to help prevent inhumane breeding conditions promote community awareness of animal welfare and foster a more human environment in the city a no pet store shall sell deliver offer for sale barter auction give away or otherwise transfer or dispose of cats or dogs b nothing in this section shall prohibit pet

purpose the community mixeduse districts are designed to encourage the development or redevelopment of mixeduse centers that may include residential office commercial park civic and institutional utility and transportation park and open space uses complementary uses should be organized into cohesive districts in which mixed or singleuse buildings are connected by streets sidewalks and trails and open space to create a pedestrianoriented environment the cmu districts are intended to be applied to areas of the city guided for redevelopment and may represent varying degrees of intensification with respect to land use hours of operation or building height 1 the cmu1 district is the most restrictive mixeduse district limiting building height and excluding the most intensive land uses and is intended for application to redevelopment areas adjacent to lowdensity residential neighborhoods 2 the cmu2 district is less restrictive being open to a wider variety of land uses and building height and is intended to provide transition from higherdensity development to parks and other natural areas 3 the cmu3 district is intended for moderate intensity development suitable for transitions between higher and lower intensity districts 4 the cmu4 district is a more intensive mixeduse district intended for areas close to hightraffic roadways and largescale commercial developments b regulating plan cmu districts must be guided by a regulating plan for each location where it is applied a regulating plan uses graphics and text to establish requirements pertaining to the following kinds of parameters where the requirements for an area governed by a regulating plan are in conflict with the design standards established in of this title the requirements of the regulating plan shall supersede and where the requirements for an area governed by a regulating plan are silent shall control 1 street and block layout the regulating plan defines blocks and streets based on existing and proposed street alignments new street alignments where indicated are intended to identify general locations and required connections but not to constitute preliminary or final

standards private streets may be utilized within the cmu districts where defined as an element of a regulating plan 3 parking a locations locations where surface parking may be located are specified by block or block face structured parking is treated as a building type b shared parking or district parking a districtwide approach to offstreet parking for nonresidential or mixed uses is preferred within the cmu district offstreet surface parking for these uses may be located up to 300 feet away from the use offstreet structured parking may be located up to 500 feet away from the use c parking reduction and cap minimum offstreet parking requirement for uses within the cmu district may be reduced to 75% of the parking requirements in of this title maximum offstreet parking shall not exceed the minimum requirement unless the additional parking above the cap is structured parking 4 building and frontage types building and frontage types are designated by block or block face some blocks are coded for several potential building types  others for one building type on one or more block faces 5 build to areas build to areas indicate the placement of buildings in relation to the street 6 uses permitted and conditional uses may occur within each building type as specified in table 10055 but the vertical arrangement of uses in a mixeduse building may be further regulated in a regulating plan   262015 c regulating plan approval process a regulating plan may be developed by the city as part of a zoning amendment following the procedures of of this title and thus approved by city council  d amendments to regulating plan minor extensions alterations or modifications of proposed or existing buildings or structures and changes in street alignment may be authorized pursuant to of
