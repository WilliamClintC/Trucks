archeological or cultural values prevention of bank slumping protection of fish and wildlife habitat and conservation of natural resources  and g the landscape plan should be planned and conducted in a manner that will minimize the extent of disturbed areas runoff velocities erosion potential and reduce and delay runoff volumes disturbed areas must be stabilized and protected as soon as possible and facilities or methods used to retain sediment on site 3 in achieving its purpose the natural landscape protection plan shall address the following issues a topography a topographic map showing the existing contour elevations at intervals of ten feet 10 is the basis of the natural landscape protection plan it is important to note slope steepness and slope length on this map the longer and the steeper the slope the greater the erosion potential  b drainage patterns locate and clearly mark all existing drainage swales and patterns on the topographic map consider where water will concentrate on the property natural drainage areas are overland flows depressions swales and natural water courses the natural drainage should be used to convey runoff on and off the site but increase runoff should be limited so erosion does not occur c soils determine and show major soil types on the topographic map plot directly on the map at the same scale for ease of interpretation soil types should be evaluated for potential for flood hazard natural drainage dept to seasonal water table permeability shrink swell potential texture and erodibility  d ground cover show the existing vegetation on the topographic map features such as tree clusters grassy areas and unique vegetation should be shown on the map any denuded or exposed soil areas should also be shown on the topographic map if at all possible existing vegetation should be maintained to minimize erosion if existing vegetation cannot be maintained then construction should be staged one site completed before the second is brainerd

natural grasses shrubs and trees should be maintained for at least twenty five feet 25 at the waters edge this buffer zone helps protect water quality provide habitat for wildlife and maintains the natural aesthetics of the shoreline  and e adjacent areas delineate areas adjacent to the site on the topographic map such features as streams roads houses or other buildings and wooded areas should be shown streams which will receive runoff from the site should be noted consider the potential for increased runoff during the construction and where the runoff will go subd 6 accessory uses within

issued by a community within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result b variances may only be issued by a community upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant and iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 1134 flood insurance notice the zoning administrator must notify the applicant for a variance that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base or regional flood level increases risks to life and property such notification must be maintained with a record of all variance actions 1135 general considerations the community may consider the following factors in granting variances and imposing conditions on variances and conditional
