commission may still find that such person acted in good faith if such person did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance for example the planning commission may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that at the time the expenditures were made either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development and the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures  city of mission ks  218558 1 2 3 c d e f a b c d when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could

sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows offering and providing such space encourages such

and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films the findings noted in subparagraphs number 1 15 raise substantial governmental concerns sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments  city of mission ks  478558 20 21 22 23 24 1 2 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of
