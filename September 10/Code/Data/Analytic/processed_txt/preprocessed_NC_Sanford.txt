this article the flowmonitoring device will be inspected and certified for accuracy each quarter of the calendar year by a cityapproved technician at the dischargers expense failure to inspect and to provide the certification will result in the use of the water meter readings for calculation of charges by the city city sewer customers are billed based on 100 percent of the water volume meters  however the rate charged is set to reflect a savings to the discharger for 20 percent of water not returned to the sewer dischargers that wish to receive credit in excess of the 20 percent allowance built in the rates may use readings of a flowmonitoring device for any readings below 80 percent the discharger may receive credit not to exceed a total credit of ten percent in cases where the reading is below 70 percent of the water usage the discharger will be given only the ten percent credit unless detailed calculations are submitted to and approved by the city manager annually verifying that such flowmonitoring device reading is reasonable and expected dischargers shall be charged for 100 percent of the water used when the reading of the flowmonitoring device reflects a volume returned greater than 80 percent of the water meter reading in no case shall dischargers be billed at a volume greater than 100 percent of the water volume supplied from all sources 2 sampling

from domestic premises with the following characteristics a cbod 250 mgl b total suspended solids 200 mgl c oil and grease 40 mgl d volume 375 gallons per day per domestic premises 2 classification of users all users are to be classified by the city either by assigning each one to a user classification category according to the principal activity conducted on the users premises by individual user analyzation or by a combination thereof the purpose of such collective or individual classification is to facilitate the regulation of wastewater discharges based on wastewater constituents and characteristics to provide an effective means of source control and to establish a system of charges and fees which will ensure an equitable recovery of the citys cost 3 basis of surcharge for nondomestic users the charges and fees for all classifications of users other than domestic premises shall be based on the relative difference between the average wastewater constituents and characteristics of that classification as related to those of domestic premises 4 basis of charges for permit users the charges and fees established for permit users shall be based on the measured or estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater discharge of that user which may include but shall not be limited to cbod cod oil and grease chlorine demand and volume 5 calculation of charges the charges for excesses of the constituents listed in this section will be based upon the mass emission rate of those constituents and determined thusly a mass emission rate shall be determined as follows mass emission rate mer     mg  c  834 where mer is the mass emission rate in pounds of a particular constituent mg is millions of gallons of wastewater c is the concentration in mgl of the particular constituent being charged for as an example cbod cod etc 834 is equal to the number of pounds per one gallon of water b the amount of the charge in dollars will be calculated thusly ao   r  mer   where ao is equal to the amount of the charge in dollars r is equal to the rate of charge per pound of constituent mer   is equal to the pounds of a constituent c an example of surcharge determination is as follows cannons corporation is a producer of canned fruits they discharged 1000000 gallons of wastewater in the month of january analysis found that the wastewater has the following characteristics cbod   400 mgl tss   950 mgl there were no other limitations exceeded in this example there were 100 employees employed at the cannery the limits of cbod and tss are 250

then the total charge for cbod is equal to ao   r  mer ao   $14500   ao   $16255 if the charge for tss is $220001000 lbs the charge would be computed thusly mertss   950  200  834  1 mg   750  834  1   6255 lbs tss or  thousand lbs tss at a charge of $22000thousand lbs the charge for tss     $22000   $137610 total surcharge for january   $16255 + $137610   $153865    method of determining rates a the council will annually review the actual cost of operation and maintenance of the citys wastewater treatment plants and adjust the surcharge rates and the volume user charge rate per 100 cubic feet to reflect the true cost of constituent treatment the adjustments if any will become effective following the first day of each new fiscal year the council may review these rates and adjust them accordingly at any time it deems adjustments are in the best interest of the city b the council shall set the surcharge rates and volume user rates from time to time and a schedule of such rates is on

of the case and shall include the factual reasons on which they are based a there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of this chapter in order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships the board must find that the five following conditions exist 1 if he complies with the provisions of this chapter the applicant can secure no reasonable return from or can make no reasonable use of his property merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting a variance moreover the board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of this chapter that will make possible the reasonable use of the property 2 the hardship results from the application of this chapter to the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship 3 the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property 4 the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates this chapter or who purchases the property after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and then comes to the board for relief 5 the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread if other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice b the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this chapter and preserves its spirit c in the granting of the variance the public safety and welfare have been ensured and substantial justice has been done the board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health safety or general welfare 3 conditions in granting the variance the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed building structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter if a variance for the construction alteration or use of property is granted such construction alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan 4 rehearing after previous denial the watershed review board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application 5 expiration a variance issued in accordance with this section shall be considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six months from the date of the decision 6 major variances a if the application calls for the granting of a major variance and if the watershed review board decides in favor of granting the variance the board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed the preliminary record of the hearing shall include 1 the variance application 2 the evidence presented 3 motions offers of proof objections to evidence and rulings on them 4 the proposed decision including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit b the preliminary record shall be sent to the state environmental management commission for its review as follows 1 if the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that the property owner can secure no reasonable return from or make no practical use of the property unless the proposed variance is granted and that the variance if granted will not result in a serious threat to the water supply then the commission shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations the commission shall prepare a

the legislative decision creating the district and applying it to the particular property a conditional zoning district allows particular uses to be established only in accordance with specific standards and conditions pertaining to each individual development project some land uses are of such a nature or scale that they have significant impacts on both the immediate surrounding area and on the entire community which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district standards there are also circumstances in which a general district designation allowing such a use by right would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could if properly planned be appropriate for the property consistent with the objectives of these regulations the adopted comprehensive plan and adopted district and area plans 2 there are two types of conditional zoning districts available  conditional zoning district type 1  conditional zoning district type 2  conditional zoning district type 1 1 the conditional zoning district type 1 is defined as a conditional zoning district created as a standalone district with its own unique conditions under a conditional zoning district type 1 an owner would have the freedom to develop hisher own unique list of permitted uses and design standards it is also understood that such a district would need to be designed so as to maintain the integrity and characteristics of the surrounding community as well as conform to the spirit and intent of the zoning conditional zoning district type 1 would be most suitable in situations where none of the current conventional zoning districts accommodate the desired uses such as a large mixeduse planned development in which the ownerdeveloper has a clear vision as to how the property is to be developed 2 only the property owners of a proposed conditional zoning district type 1 shall be eligible to apply for rezoning to a conditional zoning district 3 the owner shall specify the uses of the property and shall propose additional conditions to ensure compatibility between the development and the surrounding neighborhood the conditions shall include all

conditional zoning district type 2 is defined as a conditional zoning district created for the purpose of allowing a property owner to place additional conditions upon an existing equivalent conventional general use zoning district conditional zoning district type 2 would be the preferred zoning approach if a petitioner desired to a to reduce or narrow the number of permitted uses andor b impose higher level design standards than that which exists within an equivalent general use zoning district conditional zoning district type 2 would also be practical in situations where a petitioner desires to install or construct additional buffers or other physical features that would serve to increase the protection afforded neighboring properties andor the appearance of the proposed development 2 only the property owners of a proposed conditional zoning district type 2 shall be eligible to apply for rezoning to a conditional zoning district the owner shall specify the uses of the property and shall propose additional conditions to ensure compatibility between the development and the surrounding neighborhood the conditions shall include all of the following as applicable  the

involves several methodsquarrying openpit drilling tunneling etceach of which would affect the surrounding environment differently therefore the governing board of lee county concludes that the fundamental purposes and procedures of zoning would be served best by adopting a mining special use overlay district which can be applied to certain underlying districts if approved by the respective

of buffer yards is to provide a transitional buffer between uses that may differ in development intensity and density or to provide a minimum buffer between uses of similar intensity and density these landscaped planting yards are intended to ensure that a natural area of appropriate size and density of plantings is planted or preserved between zoning districts andor uses buffer yards shall be of different types based upon the relationship between the two adjacent land uses between which the buffer yard is to be located the width of the buffer yard and the density of plantings increase as the difference between adjacent land uses increases  applicability in addition to the exemptions as set forth in   certain uses are exempt from the buffer requirements as described in this section exemptions include but are not limited to the following  parcels separated by a public street rightof way greater than 30 feet in width   parcels separated by a railroad rightofway  yard types 1 there are five different classes of land uses for purposes of determining the buffer yard type land use classes are based upon the specific land use to be developed which is permitted either by right or conditionally or the groupings of zoning districts or land use groupings as provided in table 72 2 table 73 identifies the buffer yard type required for a given development based on the relationship between the adjacent land uses if an adjoining parcel is undeveloped the minimum buffer shall be determined based on the zoning of the adjoining property 3 table 74 contains the required plantings and dimensions of the respective buffer yard types the width of the buffer yard and the density of plantings increase as the difference in the nature and intensity of development in the respective adjacent land uses increases  standards for buffer yard development 1 prohibited uses the construction of any building or the placement of any mechanical equipment within the buffer yard is not

126 vested rights 126 127 expiration of development approvals 1211 unified development 1 purpose  the purpose of this to address the continuation of nonconforming situations and to protect vested rights its purpose is to protect private landowners by protecting their right to continue uses or planned projects while protecting the public from speculative projects which do not conform to modern planning and design principles a nonconforming situation typically addresses a condition that legally existed when this adopted but which is not now permitted by the contrast a vested right occurs where a property owner has proceeded to a given stage in the approval process but does not require that the use already be in existence 122 legal nonconforming situations continued  unless otherwise specifically provided in this subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in this nonconforming situations that legally existed prior to the effective date of this be continued legal nonconforming situations shall include all lots uses andor structures that were considered substandard but legally allowed to continue on or before the effective date of this unified development 3 undeveloped nonconforming lots  applicability this section applies only to undeveloped lots that are considered nonconforming or substandard with respect to their dimensional standards in relation to the current zoning a lot is considered undeveloped if it has no substantial structures on it  nonconformities as to lot size 1 when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in  47 then the lot may be used as proposed subject to the standards set forth in this

building setbacks the administrator may allow a reduction not to exceed twentyfive percent 25% in the dimension of any required setback yard approval shall depend upon a written finding that such reduction is reasonably necessary for practical use of the lot and will not have substantial adverse effects on adjacent property  merger of nonconforming lots if a property owners desires to develop an undeveloped nonconforming lot which adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots conforming or nonconforming under the same ownership the lots must be combined or merged prior to the issuance of any development permits the intent of this requirement is to require that nonconforming lots be reassembled in as much as possible to create conforming lots  unified development 4 nonconforming uses of land  purpose the purpose of this is to address standards for the expansion alteration andor discontinuance of nonconforming uses of land  discontinuance 1 when a nonconforming use is i discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or ii discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes 2 for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter 3 when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this the 180day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of this of use 1 a nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use 2 a nonconforming use may be changed to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located provided compliance can be achieved with the change of use standards in of this of use 1 a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed enclosed building that already houses or contains the same legal nonconforming uses open areas such as storage yards loading docks carports etc shall not be eligible for this expansion provision 2 a nonconforming use of open land that involves the removal of natural materials from the lot eg a
