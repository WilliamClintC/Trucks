categorical pretreatment standards set forth in 40 cfr chapter i subchapter n parts 405 are hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter 2 limits in categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to the discharge from the process regulated by the standard or as otherwise specified by the standard compliance with national categorical pretreatment standards is mandatory the national categorical standards may be contained in the iepa operating permit b additional requirements 1 where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the pretreatment coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 cfr 4036c unless specifically restricted by the categorical pretreatment standard these equivalent limitations calculated in accordance with the following requirements are deemed pretreatment standards users shall be required to comply with the equivalent limitations instead of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived an alternative pretreatment limit shall not be used if the alternative limit is below the analytical detection limit for any of the regulated pollutants 2 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit production the pretreatment coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual users the pretreatment coordinator calculating equivalent mass per day limitations shall calculate such limitations by multiplying the limits in the standard by the users average rate of production this average rate of production shall be based on a reasonable measure of the users actual long term daily production during a representative year and not based on design production capacity for new sources actual production shall be estimated using projected production the pretreatment coordinator shall calculate such limitations by dividing the mass limitations by the average daily flow rate of the users regulated process wastewater the average daily flow rate shall be based upon a reasonable measure of the users actual long term average flow rate such as the average daily flow rate during the representative year 3 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the pretreatment coordinator shall impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula set forth in 40 cfr 4036e  provided that said regulation allows the wastewaters to be mixed and the user can supply the information necessary to allow issuance of an alternative limit 4 a user may request a variance from the usepa based on fundamentally different factors the request must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 cfr 40313 5 a user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with 40 cfr 40315 6 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations a user may request that the village convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator the village may establish equivalent mass limits only if the user meets all the conditions set forth in subsection b6a of this section a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the user must 1 employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2 currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3 provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys long term average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the long term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4 not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and 5 have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the users request for equivalent mass limits b a user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1 maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2 continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3 continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the pretreatment coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent 20% from its baseline production rates determined in subsection b6a3 of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the pretreatment coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and  sterling codifiers inc  300618 4 continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection b6a1 of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the pretreatment coordinator 1 shall calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the user by the concentration based daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 shall reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility upon notification of a revised production rate from the user  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection 93e2a2 of this article 7 the pretreatment coordinator may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual users the conversion is at the discretion of the pretreatment coordinator 8 once included in its wastewater discharge permit the user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical pretreatment standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 9 if categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or four 4 day average limitations the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitations 10 any user operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production based standard shall notify the pretreatment coordinator within two 2 workdays after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user which fails to timely notify the pretreatment coordinator of such anticipated change shall be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its wastewater discharge permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate c reports required all users that are subject to national categorical pretreatment

detailed requirements of this title and the village subdivision requirements otherwise applicable 2 special amenities and benefits to the community beyond those required by this title and other village ordinances can be achieved by allowing more flexible design than is otherwise permitted by this title and the village subdivision regulations b these objectives can be achieved where a substantial area of land is planned for development as an integrated unit and where its design is subject to more detailed review and approval by the village than is normally required c the objective of a planned unit development pud is accordingly not simply to allow exceptions to otherwise applicable regulations it is instead to encourage a higher level of design and amenity than it is possible to achieve under the usual land development requirements d it is therefore the intent of the village to suspend the application of detailed zoning and subdivision standards only where such special amenity is achieved in this way the village may grant the creative developer a desirable flexibility and at the same time not only protect but enhance the welfare of the residents and other users of a development and the rest of the community  11132 qualification for filing as a planned unit development  sterling codifiers inc  538618 a a planned unit development may be developed in any district in
