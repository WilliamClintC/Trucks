during construction which will protect the ground area beneath the branches of trees and other areas of natural vegetation to be preserved from vehicular intrusion materials storage or other construction activities ordinance 3 walls tree wells andor other devices of appropriate design should be provided to preserve the life of trees which would otherwise be adversely affected by nearby grade changes o usable open space a minimum of sixty percent 60% of a residential project should be usable open space which is defined as land which is free of buildings structures and other substantial improvements the following examples are listed by way of illustration to indicate what may be counted as usable open space within this definition 1 outdoor swimming pools swimming pool areas hard surface recreational areas and other recreational areas provided these areas are unenclosed except for fences canopies bathhouses or other minor structures 2 customary driveways for one and twofamily dwellings 3 flat roofs with improved recreational and open space facilities with ready access 4 a maximum of onehalf  of the usable open space requirements may be satisfied by that portion of public or private rightsofway adjacent to the site and which at the ultimate expected pavement width for that classification of street will remain unpaved 5 enclosed open space areas in shopping malls including walkways 6 the following examples are listed by way of illustration to indicate what may not be counted as usable open space within this definition a roofs b open parking areas c parking structures d slopes in excess of twentyfive percent 25% e streets public or private 7 phase or identifiable segment of a residential project shall contain less than fifty percent 50% usable open space p local open space a minimum of three percent 3% of all residential areas shall be developed as local open space which is defined as usable open space which is designed to be available to the residents of the project in general is developed to meet their recreational needs and would not normally be considered as the yard of a particular building land which is valley city code within twentyfive 25 feet behind or twentyfive 25 feet in front or ten 10 feet to either side of a building shall not be included in this definition the following standards shall apply 1 local open space regardless of size which is to be dedicated to the city must be approved by the park board and accepted by the board of aldermen 2 no local open space area may be less than twenty thousand 20000 square feet except in puds of less than fifteen and threetenths 153 acres nor larger than three 3 acres except when stream valley parks storm drainage utility easements or green buffers are included with the written permission of the planning and zoning commission 3 any area or segment of an open space less than one hundred 100 feet in width cannot be calculated as local open space unless it is clearly part of an overall open space system for example a linear pedestrian system linking larger open spaces could be included in the calculation 4 a local open space area smaller than twenty thousand 20000 square feet or larger than three 3 acres may be authorized particularly if practical difficulties or unusual hardship would be caused by the application of the required standards 5 when open space land is stream valley or floodplain or without sufficient adequatelysized and reasonably level areas for selected active recreational use the city may require that additional land of a suitable nature be provided even though the total required is more than the regularly required amount 6 in meeting the local open space requirement not more than half the required local open space may consist of the storm drainage reservation land and the other half must be supplied from other land in all cases where storm drainage area is counted toward meeting local open space requirements preservation of the natural assets of the land including its vegetation must be provided for in graphic andor written form subject to approval by the planning and zoning commission 7 required local open space must meet the definition of usable open space land in public utility easements may be included in the local open space provision to the full extent that the use of the land is not restricted for recreational purposes to the extent that it is restricted additional land must be designated by the developer ordinance 8 a developer may choose to mix his types of housing ie singlefamily row houses apartments etc or to cluster homes and reduce private yard size this will in many cases result in a substantially larger open space area than the legal minimum for example a site in an r1 r1a r1b r1c zone developed entirely with singlefamily homes would provide only the required three percent 3% of the site for local open space if however some apartments and row houses were mixed with the singlefamily homes in an r1 r1a r1b r1c zone to achieve the same overall density the lesser physical space required for the row houses and apartments per dwelling unit would obviously leave considerably more actual open space 9 local open space in addition to the three percent 3% minimum requirement shall be distributed reasonably throughout the subdivision that is within any portion of a development tract a portion being an area separated by roads by topographic natural or manmade barriers the area of local open space should be in proportion to the percentage of living units within that portion of the tract deviations from this principle will be permitted where a severe topographic or other site conditions restrict the area in which development is feasible or outstanding natural features worthy of preservation are present such as a grove of pine trees and should be included in the open space area b transition area requirements are satisfied in terms of open space c a buffer zone of open space would protect homes such as along their perimeter of a major highway or an industrial site d utilities such as sewer and water cannot be brought to a portion of the site e the developer can demonstrate that the layout will result in a clear improvement to the general amenity and greater specific recreational advantages to the residents of the proposed subdivisions such uses and advantages shall be specified in the restrictive covenants and provision for the maintenance of such spaces shall be clearly indicated examples are golf courses or systems of horseback trails 10 the distance between clusters of structures should be considerable less compact than that provided by minimum dimensions local open space areas should be more valley city code numerous with shorter service depth more space should be provided for amenities including landscaping screening greater distance between buildings buffer zones etc centerfocus sites may be more pleasingly connected with each other and homes by linear spaces q development of local open space improved local open space for both active and passive recreation shall be provided as appropriate where permanent maintenance can be assured the improvement shall be consistent with the size of the development age levels and needs of intended users and shall consider operation and maintenance costs 1 adequate recreation space appropriately equipped shall be provided consisting of open areas for active recreation such as playgrounds or major sports and places for passive recreation such as parks and sitting areas 2 publicly owned and maintained parks playgrounds and school grounds which are convenient to a development and readily available for use by the residents should be considered in the design of the site adjoining public facilities shall not be considered in meeting the three percent 3% minimum local open space requirement in total or in part r local open space distribution 1 the distance between local open space areas is almost as important in their design as is their size  the distance determines the density of distribution throughout the subdivision the maximum walking distance from the home and the number of people conveniently served by each local open space in subdivision design planning service depth is a more convenient term of measure than distance between local open space areas 2 service depth is the distance between the boundary of a local open space and the boundary of its surrounding service area and is roughly onehalf  the distance between two 2 local open spaces service depths should be kept as constant as possible in order to maintain equitable relationships with homes served where depths vary however local open spaces should desirably be scaled to the size of the population served 3 all homes should be within five hundred 500 feet of a local open space or other public park or recreational area accessible to the residents 4 at densities of up to five and fivetenths 55 living units per acre where the developer provides only the minimum ordinance percentage of local open space required the private yard spaces of the individual homes will be large enough to provide for some recreational needs the local open space acreage therefore should be distributed in local open spaces of at least one 1 acre in size in order to satisfy those needs requiring larger areas than provided in individual yards in these cases the service depths will necessarily be larger than the maximum five hundred 500 feet local open spaces should be compact in shape and evenly distributed or combined with additional space provided reservations 5 groups of residential units may be distributed throughout developable area in clusters or groups of clusters houses or apartment buildings arranged about common parking courts or service streets these clusters are planned to be small enough to afford ready pedestrian access from all homes to the continuous open space in which they are placed s access to local open space 1 at least one 1 unencumbered access easement with minimum width of twenty 20 feet shall be required for each local open space from public streets for maintenance purposes an access easement at least ten 10 feet wide shall be required for all sidewalks or pathways the sidewalk easement may with the approval of the planning and zoning commission be included within the twenty 20 foot access easement for maintenance purposes street frontage may be included within the definition of access easements 2 where the pathway system serving a residential neighborhood passes individual local open space to be retained by the developer or homes association public rightofway or easement shall be secured 3 opportunities should be seized to join separate local open spaces into a network of local open spaces community parks schoolrecreation centers reservoirs lakes and the major parks of an area the total acreage is not as significant as the establishment of a completely interlinked system each development where possible should contribute to the eventual whole 4 where the developer of a singlefamily house subdivision elects to reduce lot size to afford an area of common open space the space should be distributed so that it clearly relates to as many of the smaller lots as is practicable valley city code 5 paved accessways to maintenance points may be required in order that the department of public works may have adequate access to storm drainage areas and sanitary sewers t pedestrian access to

pathway the sidewalk or pathway shall be at least eight 8 feet from the wall containing the window unless privacy of the interior space is not essential or would not be impaired u sidewalks and pathways  objective 1 pedestrian walkways should connect every home with the major attractions of potential pedestrian movement these include vehicles and vehicular areas schools shopping and local parks they will include sidewalks crosswalkways and interior pathways they should be designed and located so as to avoid conflict and danger from vehicles particularly at intersections with local or collector streets 2 the initial sidewalk and pathway policy is to review each subdivision individually to determine whether the walkway system will be related 1 exclusively to the streets 2 exclusively to interior open space systems or 3 some combination of both ordinance 3 when structures are set back less than thirtythree 33 feet from the curb line and driveways are provided an

note  adopted  repealed ch 415 flood hazard prevention and enacted new provisions set out herein former ch 415 derived from ord no 185 adopted  ordinance article i statutory authorization findings of fact and purposes authorization findings of fact and purposes  a statutory authorization the legislature of the state of missouri has in rsmo as amended delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the board of aldermen of grain valley missouri ordains as follows b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of grain valley missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and b the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis for jackson county missouri dated  as amended and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto ordinance b calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those
