the street fire protection school recreation and utility systems  and in general to promote the public health safety order convenience prosperity and welfare of the people living in the community   interpretation of regulations this section recognizes that there is a tension inherent in the regulatory approach in that minimum standards must be set in the context of typical or anticipated development it is not intended that such regulations frustrate good design but some approaches by good designers which are quite atypical and therefore neither envisioned nor expressly regulated by this titles standards are probably inevitable  therefore whenever an administrator judiciary or other decisionmaking body is called upon to do so this title shall be interpreted in conformance with the purposes intended by the city to be served by its enactment any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted should only be made when the party interpreting this title has the power to impose additional restrictions or conditions to protect the public and exercises this power the intent of the standards and supporting definitions is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts which might otherwise be the result of a proposed use to this end those called upon to interpret this title shall proceed as follows 1determine the public purposes of the standards with respect to which an interpretation is required 2determine the actual impact of a proposed interpretation 3determine that the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of a land owner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal   provisions of this title declared to be minimum in their interpretation the provisions of this title shall be held to be minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health safety and general welfare whenever the requirements of any lawfully adopted rules regulations and ordinances conflict the most restrictive or that imposing the higher standards shall govern   liability the granting of approval of any structure or use shall not constitute a representation guarantee or warranty of any kind or nature by the city of myrtle creek or any official or employee thereof or of the practicality or

slope hazard area permitted uses and structures conditional uses and structures dimensional standards density factor site capacity calculation development standards and review criteria  purpose to serve as a low density residential district which is similar to the purpose and intent of the r1 district but where it is recognized that densities should vary according to location and topography   intent the intent of the residential hillside district is to maintain and enhance the visual and physical identify of the hills as well as native geologic conditions and to identify areas of potential natural hazards due to soil conditions andor slope   objective the approach set forth in the residential hillside district regulations takes a larger than lotbylot perspective in regulating environmental degradation the objective is to permit maximum development while at the same time protecting resources by requiring a site capacity rather than a lot capacity analysis of developmental constraints the site capacity calculation uses the open space ratio as a standard to ensure protection of the natural environment in a dependable and consistent fashion in addition developmental limits are specified on a resourcebyresource basis for example no disturbance of a very unstable or rare resource is permitted whereas some level of disturbance of a less sensitive feature may be allowed in summation the residential hillside district regulations endeavor to 1provide site and design standards intended to minimize impacts in hazardous areas  2provide review procedures intended to preserve the environmental quality of the area  and 3encourage clustered development and a variety of housing types to better utilize lands with topographic constraints   designation of slope hazard area 1properties classified as residential hillside by the provisions of this title are recognized as containing areas where slope may be a development factor the soil series survey and the topography information compiled for the natural features element of the comprehensive plan support document and records of known steep slopes are the basis for establishing the rh district boundaries because the general mapping and studies prepared for the comprehensive plan are not intended for development purposes detailed information for individual parcels or ownerships shall be submitted with each application for development 2the city engineer is hereby designated to review all applications for development in the rh district to identify the slope hazard and to determine the acreage of land with development constraints to implement the site capacity calculation of mcmc  the city engineer shall have the authority to require a site investigation report as described in mcmc  to be submitted with an application when in his professional judgment the site contains areas of potential hazard likely to be affected by the proposed development except that a site investigation report is specifically required for all building sites containing areas of greater than 25 percent slope or identified mass movement hazard areas 3the initial review of an application may provide information calling for an adjustment of the rh district boundaries for an individual parcel property which is zoned rh but where slope does not appear to be a development factor may be corrected legislatively to r1 as provided by mcmc 1 if all of the following circumstances exist aall slopes within the building construction site are less than 12 percent  bthe natural development constraints listed in step 2

retain visibility from windows facing the front yard for a minimum of 45 degrees in each direction the provisions of this subsection do not apply to the relationship between buildings that are all part of a single development   density factor elsewhere in this title residential land use intensity is expressed as gross density or number of units per gross acre  the regulations of the rh district are based on the use of a density factor which applies only to buildable land and results in a determination of site capacity therefore the intensity of use of any piece of buildable land within the district is held constant although the gross density may vary depending on the characteristics of the individual property the reason for this is that the gross density cannot accommodate variations in the physical site the density factor is a direct measurement of the impact of a given development on road systems community facilities schools and services the residential hillside maximum density factor is 688 this is comparable to a gross density of four units per acre when calculated for a site which is free of development constraints   site capacity calculation the site capacity for any proposed development is equal to the net buildable area of the site multiplied by the density factor the site capacity calculation provides the mechanism for subtracting from the base site area all portions of a site inappropriate for development to determine the extent to which a site may be utilized given its unique physical characteristics the following four steps are utilized to calculate the site capacity the totals of steps 1 2 and 3 are used to determine the net buildable site area which is then multiplied by the density factor to determine the number of units permitted step 4 1step 1  base site area certain portions of a tract may not be useable for the activity proposed for the site these are subtracted from the total acreage involved to determine base site area as follows

to afford relief 5variances shall only be issued upon aa showing of good and sufficient cause  ba determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and ca determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants or economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare 7variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection 1 of this section and otherwise complies with mcmc 1 and 2 8any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation   provisions

designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads including the effects of buoyancy hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed required openings stated in subsection 5b of this section because of hydrodynamic loads crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional such as a registered architect or professional engineer other types of foundations are recommended for these areas bthe crawlspace is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation bfe and as such must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of flood waters the bottom of each flood vent opening can be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade cportions of the building below the bfe must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage this includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building but also any joists insulation or other materials that extend below the bfe the recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation above the bfe dany building utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above the bfe or designed so that flood waters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions ductwork in particular must either be placed above the bfe or sealed from flood waters ethe interior grade of a crawlspace below the bfe must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade fthe height of the belowgrade crawlspace measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall must not exceed four feet at any point the height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas gthere must be an adequate drainage system that removes flood waters from the interior area of the crawlspace the enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event the type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics such as soil types possible options include natural drainage welldrained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means hthe velocity of flood waters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace for velocities in excess of five feet per second other foundation types should be used for more detailed information refer to fema
