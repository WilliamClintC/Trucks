prolonged tethering as well as the negative effect it has on a dog making it threetimes more likely to bite dogs are social pack animals by nature requiring closeness and interaction to be content  thus prolonged tethering or confinement deprives them of their basic social and instinctual needs they are also den animals preferring a safe and quiet place to rest such as your house a dog who resides more in a home than in the yard is a much happier and trainable animal because of the security of a den and the companionship of the human pack dogs that are tethered for prolonged periods of time are also more likely to exhibit signs of stress or being anxious digging barking howling or whining chewing and hyperactivity walking a dog on a leash playing and spending time with it in the house can relieve these symptoms keep in mind dogs that are usually tethered when outside will be more likely pull on 118 a leash when walked because they are used to the tension of the tether and pull against it it may take some training and patience to get them used to walks on leashes recommendations  when tethered the dog is in visual range of the responsible party as dogs may cause a nuisance become injured or knock over water bowls it is advisable for the responsible party to be available to take immediate action for such situations  dogs have a buckletype collar made of nylon or leather with current dog license and id tag attached when connected to a tether this type of collar is less likely to cause injury to the neck there should be enough room between the collar and the dogs throat two adult fingers may fit  dogs are tethered to a pulley running line or trolley system as opposed to a stationary object the tether will be less likely to knock over water and food bowls and gives the dog more ample space for exercise  the dog is at least six months of age when being tethered  in the winter months use heated water bowls outside to prevent drinking water from freezing heated water bowls are available at most major pet supplies stores  consider putting up a mesh fence around your yard instead of tethering it is one the simplest and cheapest types of fencing

suitable soils for subsurface septic disposal in areas not served by municipal or private waste treatment facilities only  2 on the least fertile areas for agricultural uses and in a manner which maximizes the usable area remaining for such agricultural uses  3 within any woodland contained in the parcel or along the far edges of the open fields adjacent to any woodland to reduce impact upon agriculture to provide summer shade and shelter from winter wind and to enable new construction to be visually absorbed by natural landscape features  4 in such a manner that the common boundary

town of easthampton whereas detention basins or ponds are an increasingly popular method of holding storrnwater for commercial and residential developments and whereas the town of easthampton recognizes the importance of the use of detention basins in reducing water runoff  and whereas detention basins require some amount of maintenance to ensure longterm effectiveness the town of easthampton hereby establishes the following policy for the maintenance and ownership of water detention basins and ponds lurpose due to recent policies desiring no net site runoff detention basins have become a preferred method of stormwater management basins are depressions in the land designed to hold the runoff from a particular site during the 100year storm water then drains slowly to ground sources or slowly joins open streams drainage systems shall conform to the follcming general drainage principles 1 maximize recharge 2 minimize runoff 3 m1n1m1ze clearing for drainage 4 m1n1m1ze erosion and siltation 5 minimize cost of the drainage system and 6 maintain the integrity of the natural drainage system for example swales kettle holes and intermittent streams the purpose of this policy is to provide design guidelines as well as to establish the short and longterm ownership and maintenance responsibilities of the basins 84 design i soil tests and results as required in the development impact statement dis soil tests will be performed to determine the type of soil in the proposed subdivision and the permeability of the soil this information is to be used to determine the design of the stormwater detentiondrainage system over permeable soils generally storrnwater shall be detained so that it infiltrates the soil at or near the source and there is no net runoff from the site over impermeable soils stormwater drainage systems shall be designed to maximize the loss of pollutants and sedimentation prior to water infiltrating or running off the site where both soil types are present the stormwater system should be designed such that the retention systems drain to the detention areas where topography allows  or two separate systems may be required ii design standards for permeable soils 1 to the extent possible stormwater detention areas shall make use of existing natural features including topography and vegetation 2 vegetation and natural materials such as but not limited to grasses wetland plants stone and timbers are preferred over concrete riprap and other manmade materials 3 detention areas shall be designed for the 100year storm 4 detention areas shall not allow standing water higher than eighteen 18 inches for more than three days 5 the side slopes of any detention area shall not exceed a  slope iii design standards for impermeable soils 1 to the extent possible storrnwater retention areas and irrigation systems shall make use of existing natural features 2 vegetation and natural materials such as but not limited to grasses wetland plants stone and timbers are preferred over concrete riprap and other manmade materials 85 3 retention systems shall be designed for the 100year stonn 4 stormwater systems shall be designed as a series of smaller retentiondiversion areas rather than a single large pond 5 retention areas shall have an overflow mechanism dl interaction with other recharge methods detention areasjretention systems may be used in conjunction with other recharge methods these include but are not limited to gabion weirs rooftop pending retention parking areas dutch drains porous asphalt paving lattice concrete blocks and bricks terraces diversions runoff spreaders swales in series andjor seepage pits or beds ownership i commercial and industrial development detention basins in commercial or industrial developments shall be owned by the developer an individual owner or a group of owners on a separate parcel ii residential development in residential developments detention basins larger than 1000 square feet shall be placed on their own lots which shall not be buildable access by way of a twenty foot easement shall be provided to the detention pond lots these detention basins shall be owned by the developer until such time as all the building lots are sold at that time the ownership shall be placed with a homeowners association established for this or other purposes detention ponds which are smaller than 1000 square feet may be included as part of other building lots ovmership of the detention ponds is therefore conveyed with the lot an easement for access must still be provided to the town maintenance regular maintenance is an important part in the longtenn continued effectiveness a plan for maintenance of the detention basins and associated structures shall be included in the submittal of any plan this plan should include schedules for mowing andjor trap cleaning for example 86 all detention basins shall have easements to the town of easthampton in the event that the town must provide additional maintenance the responsibility of maintaining detention basins within a development commercial or residential shall lie with the developer until the infrastructure has been put in place and all the lots have been sold at such time the detention basin maintenance shall either remain the responsibility of the developer or shall be transferred to a homeowners association the homeowners association may petition the town to accept the maintenance responsibility of the basins this request shall be brought to the planning board and must be approved by the planning board and the department of public works inspection and enforcement the town of easthampton shall be responsible for ensuring that the detention areas are being maintained toward this end the town has the right to inspect the detention basins and to issue requests that maintenance be performed in the event the maintenance is not performed the town may issue fines of up to $100 per day per basin until the maintenance is complete if the town must perform the maintenance itself the town may bill the responsible party for the cost of labor 87 appendix j deveidfment impacr statement
