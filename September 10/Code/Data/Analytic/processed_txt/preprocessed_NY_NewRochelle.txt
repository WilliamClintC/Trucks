speak to the person soliciting solicitation in proximity to transportation centers municipal parking facilities bank entrances checkcashing businesses automated teller machines or other automated

displays have characteristics which obviously make them different in some respects from verbal speech for example they are generally more permanent than a person or group of people who speak and then move on their size can be almost limitless if not constructed and erected properly they can be dangerous they can attract vandals and particularly if placed in parks children one cannot tell who is responsible for their placement and removal without a mechanism for responsible persons to identify themselves b being aware that certain physical displays on public property are entitled to the same protections as verbal speech and also being aware that physical displays are different from verbal speech in some respects the city council believes that it is in the best interest of the city to have a stated set of rules regarding such displays which can be applied evenhandedly which will encourage and provide for dissemination of ideas on public property in a manner consistent with the other

findings  purpose  3192 definitions as used in this article the following terms shall have the meanings indicated feeding  the feeding of wildlife shall mean the placing of any food substances on public property within 100 feet of any wildlife wildlife  shall include any animal which is not normally domesticated in the state of new york including but not limited to coyotes deer turkeys feral cats foxes raccoons skunks and birds inclusive of waterfowl and pigeons  3193 prohibitions it shall be unlawful for any person to feed provide food or assist another person in the feeding of wildlife defined herein in from or upon any park or public property no person shall purposely or knowingly leave or store any refuse garbage food product pet food forage product or supplement salt seed birdseed fruit or grain in a manner that would constitute an attractant to any wildlife as defined herein the city council finds that the feeding of wildlife in public areas can cause harm to both people and animals wildlife can carry many diseases that readily spread to people pets and livestock these diseases include rabies lyme disease salmonellosis rocky mountain spotted fever tularemia distemper and encephalitis in addition most wildlife species carry parasites that are also easily transferred to humans for example raccoon round worms can be fatal to humans and scabies mites cause mange in pets moreover though wildlife may accept food from people they will likely not get the balanced diet they need for good health animals that are fed by humans often lose their natural fear of people and any wild animal no matter how timid is capable of inflicting injury to humans pets and livestock a the city council finds based upon extensive investigation that feeding wildlife in public areas adversely affects the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city of new rochelle b 320 editors note this ordinance also repealed former ch 319 waterfowl art i feeding prohibited

is governed by the use of the underlying zoning district and the dimensional and other provisions of the floating overlay zone 1 floating overlay zones are distinct from overlay zones because of

their rank on the eligible list from which they were appointed  that person having the highest rank having greater retention rights over those having lower ranks 4 all temporary provisional and contingent permanent employees occupying these positions must be let go before any permanent employee is suspended from such positions 5 probationary employees occupying such positions in the same title must also be suspended before any permanent employee in the layoff unit in that title who has completed his probationary period probationary employees do however have superior retention rights

occupied title in direct line of promotion in the same layoff unit having the least seniority if the employee who seeks to displace has greater retention standing 1 where the layoff involved more than one position in a title the order of displacement will be the inverse of the order of suspension that is the most senior of the suspended employees will be the first to displace this shall apply to both vertical bumping and retreat 2 if an employee refuses to displace a junior incumbent he must be laid off this however does not protect the junior incumbent from being compared in retention standing with other incumbents if other positions at the higher level are being abolished 3 when a next lower title has been occupied by means of displacement regardless of when the displacement into the title has occurred it is considered to be occupied for further displacement purposes  however a next lower title which has all of its positions abolished at the same time as positions are abolished at the higher level cannot be considered as occupied a title which 4 c  a36726 window cleaners  a36726  is occupied by an incumbent temporary provisional contingent permanent probationary or

may retreat by displacing the incumbent with the least retention right who is serving in a position in the title in which the displacing incumbent last served on a permanent basis prior to service in the title from which he is currently suspended or displaced retreat may only occur where the position in the title formerly held by the displacing incumbent is occupied in the competitive class in the same layoff unit and at a lower salary grade  the service of the displacing incumbent while in the former title must have been satisfactory and the junior incumbent must have less retention standing than the displacing incumbent 2 the service of the displacing incumbent in the title to which he is retreating need not have been in the same layoff unit as the one from which he is displaced 3 an employee may also displace by retreat to a position in a title he last served on a permanent basis although he had intervening service in other titles as long as his service in each of the intervening titles was on other than a permanent basis he may also displace by retreat to a position which does not count in the computation of his continuous service 4 where a title change has been effected to better describe the duties of a position but the duties have not substantially changed since the suspended employee last served in that title the new title will for retreat purposes be deemed to be the former title 5 d an employee who refuses to accept an appointment afforded by displacement for whatever reason waives all rights regarding the displacement  however this employees name will be
