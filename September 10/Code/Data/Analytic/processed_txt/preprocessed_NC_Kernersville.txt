chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare of the citizenry of the town of kernersville provide for an orderly regulation of the location of adult establishments and to eliminate the undesired secondary effects of adult establishments including but not limited to illegal sexual activity and other criminal conduct occurring on or in the immediate proximity of such establishments as well as unsanitary and unhealthy conditions on or within such establishments this article is adopted and enacted pursuant to the authority granted by north carolina general statutes 160a174 160a194 and 160a1811 the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials or other expressive activities including sexually oriented materials or activities similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to in any way condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material or material harmful to minors b findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the board of aldermen and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426

angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the board of aldermen finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing private or semiprivate booths or cubicles encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states six hundred 600 in 198 two thousand two hundred 2200 in 198 four thousand six hundred 4600 in 198 eight thousand five hundred fiftyfive 8555 in 198 two hundred fiftythree thousand and four hundred fortyeight 253448 seven hundred seventyfour thousand and four hundred sixtyseven 774467 8 as of  there have been twentythree thousand seven hundred seventy 23770 reported cases of hiv and aids in the state of north carolina 9 since 1981 and to the present there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the hiv antibody test in north carolina 10 the number of cases of early less than one 1 year syphilis in the united states reported annually rose between 1982 and 199 but has decreased since then nonetheless north carolina has a syphilis rate that exceeds the national average 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million 500000 cases being reported in 199 an estimated national number of cases of more than six hundred fifty thousand 650000 in 1999 according to the center for disease control the gonorrhea rate in north carolina exceeds the national average 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 operation of sexually oriented businesses after  pm and the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of a sexually oriented business exacerbate the deleterious secondary effects of such business in the town 17 the findings noted in subsections number 1 16 raise substantial governmental concerns and thus sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths requiring a separation between performers and patrons and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 24 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this article  2 71 2003 definitions the following words and phrases when used in this chapter shall

planning and regulation of development   3 findings it is hereby determined that development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in this ordinance therefore the town of kernersville board of aldermen establishes this set of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of state and federal law regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge 414 purpose 414a general the

session law 2004163   185  as well as sedimentation pollution control  floodway regulation  planning and regulation of development   3 findings it is hereby determined that development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge  these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment  and these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including this jurisdiction to adopt the minimum stormwater
