states supreme court and in studies in many communities around the country including but not limited to dallas texas  tucson arizona  newport news virginia  garden grove california  and newport kentucky finds that acertain sexually explicit entertainment activities which are or may become located near areas zoned for residential use near schools and public parks and near malls and similar open spaces that cater to use by family groups and children would adversely affect the viability of such nearby properties for such purposes  bthe city of bowling green and the united states government have spent millions of dollars on community development and neighborhood enhancement projects over the past years to attempt to eliminate blight and to further prevent deterioration of the citys neighborhoods  ccertain sexually explicit entertainment activities because of the conditions of their operations have or may contribute to an increased incidence of crime and juvenile delinquency particularly when such activities are located in close proximity to one another  dcertain sexually explicit entertainment facilities particularly displays tend to attract undesirable clientele that discourage neighborhood residents from undertaking civic improvements and cause residents and businesses to move elsewhere andor may frustrate attempts to attract new residents and businesses to come into a particular area all of which factors contribute to a diminution of property values and to a general deterioration of the citys neighborhoods  ethe establishment of small closetlike rooms or booths at sexually explicit amusement facilities in the city may encourage persons to loiter for illegitimate purposes and may encourage lewd conduct in public places thereby creating a public nuisance and a danger to health and safety including the spread of communicable diseases  fthe concentration of sexually explicit movies books and sexual paraphernalia in the city the establishment of businesses that house sexually explicit movies and hotel rooms which may be rented by the hour that offer free sexually explicit movies in the room have provided prostitutes an appealing and visible meeting place to ply their trade and this has and may create public nuisances and may create supermarkets of sex in otherwise respectable city neighborhoods  gthe value of free expression in a free society can be protected by affording an opportunity for products and services to be sold at distinct and separate locations where such goods and services will be just as available to the public wishing to pay for them but with dramatically less deleterious effect on abutting neighborhoods  hsome video cassette rental outlets have or may become engaged in the rental and distribution of movies which are distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on sexual activities as hereinafter defined as a principal portion of their business activity requiring that such

effects of exposure to sexually explicit portrayals on jackets in which such movies are packaged  ithe noise generated by patrons coming and going from sexually explicit entertainment activity establishments may cause a substantial disruption to nearby residents and a modest curtailment of the hours during which entertainment is offered to patrons coming and going from such establishments would afford some relief to persons residing nearby without significantly interfering with the availability of the offered entertainment therein  jsexually explicit entertainment establishments which may have integrated several forms of sexually explicit entertainment in one business premise have had a greater blighting effect on surrounding land uses than have establishments which engage in only one form of sexually explicit entertainment  kthe regulation of escort services providing sexually explicit services will deter prostitution and public indecency and will secure the public health and safety of the city  and lnationally there is extensive involvement of organized crime in the business of sexually explicit entertainment activities which is regulated herein and that the disclosure of the names of persons who own as well as the names of the persons who operate such sexually explicit bookstores and other sexually explicit entertainment establishments would aid law enforcement

that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this subchapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners bit is the duty of the city of bowling green citycounty planning commission to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this subchapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 1designation of variance and appeal board the city of bowling green hereby establishes the bowling green  warren county board of adjustments as the body to hear requests for variances and the city of bowling green board as the body to hear and decide appeals 2duties of variance and appeals board athe board of adjustments shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this subchapter and the board shall hear appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator or designated code officials in the enforcement or administration of this subchapter bany person aggrieved by the decision of either body may appeal such decision to the appropriate court as provided in the kentucky revised statutes 3variance procedures in passing upon applications for variances the board of adjustments shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors and all standards specified in other sections of this the adanger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  csusceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  dimportance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  enecessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  favailability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  gcompatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  hrelationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  isafety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  jexpected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and kcosts of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges 4conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this subchapter the board of adjustments may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures set forth in this been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result cvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the board of adjustments need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the board of adjustments believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the provisions setout hereinabove dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure evariances shall only be issued upon 1a showing of good and sufficient cause  2a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this subchapter  and 3a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances fany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation gthe floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all variance actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request h variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of this satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 5variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that athe issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars $25 for one hundred dollars $100 of insurance coverage  and bsuch construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the warren county clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in the biannual report submission to the federal emergency management agency 6historic structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 7no impact

introduction nonpoint source pollution is now responsible for up to eighty percent 80% of pollution in waters of the us which include streams lakes rivers and wetlands this is true in part due to significant reductions in direct discharges of pollutants by industry that have been achieved since passage of the clean water act cwa of 1972 in urban areas nonpoint source pollution occurs because storm water runoff collects impurities while passing over rooftops streets parking lots landscaping and gutters this polluted storm water runoff typically enters a storm drain system and is rapidly conveyed to a lake stream or river the percentage of impervious land cover in urban and suburban watersheds generally indicates the level of pollutant impact on receiving waters in most cases impervious cover in excess of thirty percent 30% results in streams that are considered degraded while impervious cover between ten and thirty percent 10% 30% causes impacts on the receiving streams typical residential development results in approximately thirtyfive percent 35% of a watershed being impervious which is more than enough to degrade the receiving waters realization of this fact is important because healthy nonimpacted streams are important for a healthy ecosystem and a healthy ecosystem is important for all living creatures including people in warren county the karst cave system has been utilized often overly so to manage storm water runoff utilization of karst for storm water management is not an exact science it is often difficult to predict the exact pathways of underground streams and thus the impact of introducing increased runoff to downstream locations we have also come to realize that the karst system has limits and see this in the form of basins that do not readily drain or may even surcharge when the cave system is full a second byproduct of utilizing the karst for storm water drainage is the almost immediate introduction of contaminates into our water systems fertilizers and other chemicals that are used on lawns are carried directly into storm sewers then into basins and often into drywells and sinkhole boxes with no treatment ultimately these toxins travel into our ground water streams lakes effecting wildlife and our source drinking water to protect our natural resources the cwa of 197 as amended in 198 prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of the us and mandates that storm water not be discharged unless it is in compliance with a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit bowling green and warren county are responsible for ensuring that discharges of storm water from pubic storm water systems into waters of the state comply with cwa requirements the implementation of the requirements contained in this manual will be a primary mechanism for accomplishing this objective warren county stormwater guide appendix b   storm water management in bowling greenwarren county shall include management for quality as well as quantity flood protection this storm water appendix is intended as a guide only to provide information on the structural water quality and water quantity best management practices bmps permanent water quality treatment measures described in this chapter should not be confused with erosion and sediment controls required during construction b2 general design criteria storm water management in bowling greenwarren county shall include management for quality and quantity this section provides the general design criteria for both b21 water quantity control water quantity controls shall be implemented so that postdevelopment peak discharges do not exceed predevelopment discharges for those storms listed in table b1 b22 water quality controls research has indicated that capturing and treating eighty percent 80% of the total annual runoff volume provides effective water quality treatment volume based on removal of particulates effective removal of solid particles in the runoff also provides for removal of significant amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and oil and grease ninety percent 90% of the annual runoff seems to be a large volume but the storm events that cumulatively produce this runoff volume in warren county produce less than 10 inches of runoff each using historical rainfall records typical soil parameters and the swmm model the runoff depth necessary for eighty percent 80% runoff capture was approximated as a function of percent impervious area these values which are shown in table b1 represent the water quality depth that shall be treated for each development for example a twenty 20acre development that is forty percent 40% impervious has a water quality depth of 07 inches over the whole area not just the impervious area resulting in a water quality volume wqv of 50820 cubic feet in addition to carrying pollutants storm water runoff from developed areas increases the frequency and duration of bankfull flows in the receiving streams causing increased erosion of the stream banks and further degradation of instream water quality onsite infiltration designed for the increased runoff due to development is the preferred solution to this impact warren county stormwater guide appendix b   table b1 water quality depth versus percent impervious surface % impervious surface water quality depth inches 0 to 9 0 10

bioretention systems bioretention is a practice to treat storm water runoff using a conditioned planting soil bed and planting materials to filter runoff stored within a shallow depression the method combines physical filtering and absorption with biological processes the system consists of a structure to spread flow a pretreatment filter strip or grass channel a sand bed pea gravel overflow curtain drain a shallow ponding area a surface organic layer of mulch a planting soil bed plant material a gravel underdrain system and an overflow system figure b1 shows a diagram of a bioretention system designed to receive runoff from a paved area b31 applicability bioretention systems are very effective for water quality treatment bioretention systems are particularly well suited for use in parking lot islands roadside swales and median strips warren county stormwater guide appendix b   b32 design criteria size the area of the filter bed in accordance with the design wqv corresponding to the area draining to it see the next section for procedure design the bioretention system to be online with an overflow catch basin as shown in figure b1 to handle volumes exceeding the design wqv design the bioretention system to have a longitudinal slope of 0 to 1 percent 01% provide a pretreatment system composed of a pea gravel diaphragm and a grassed filter strip the pea gravel diaphragm also serves as a flow spreader dimensions of the gravel diaphragm and grass filter strip shown in figure b1 are minimums when flow into a bioretention system is parallel to its long dimension ie from a drainage swale omit the gravel diaphragm shown in figure b1 and provide a berm across the downstream end of the system to impede the flow the top of the berm shall be level across the base of the bioretention system and be twelve to eighteen 1218 inches high in the center provide a planting soil bed with a minimum width of four 4 feet and a minimum depth of four 4 feet including a twelve 12inch sand bed the planting soil bed can be as wide as fifteen 15 feet the area of the system is determined by the required area of the filter bed the minimum length is fifteen 15 feet for widths greater than ten 10 feet maintain at least a  length to width ratio provide a pea gravel curtain drain as shown in figure b1 the minimum width of the curtain drain is eight 8 inches provide a two to three 23 inch thick mulch layer above the planting soil bed grade the top of the planting soil bed to provide a shallow ponding area with a maximum depth of six 6 inches provide an underdrain system of gravel and perforated pipe design the gravel bed to be at least eight 8 inches deep connect the underdrain to the storm drainage system or design it to daylight to a suitable nonerosive outfall

adverse impacts on the receiving waters that result from increasing the impervious area this chapter describes several infiltration practices that can be used in many different situations many of the practices cannot function as the sole water quality infiltration and treatment device but will provide significant credits toward reducing the magnitude of the runoff that must be detained and treated infiltration practices include a variety of practices such as directing downspouts to grassed areas and using modular pavement infiltration practices also include swales terraforming infiltration and vegetative filters terraforming is a term for special grading practices such as terracing and berming that are intended to promote infiltration this section presents infiltration practices and describes the minimum requirements that must be met to obtain credits to reduce water quality treatment volumes the infiltration volume credit listed for each practice can be used to satisfy an equal amount of water quality volume b41 downspouts to grass discharging downspouts from roofs onto grassed yards encourages infiltration and reduces direct discharge to impervious areas such as driveways the grass area shall be greater than or equal to the roof area infiltration credit when downspouts are discharged onto grass the infiltration credit is  acrefeet per acre of roof area design criteria the lot must be graded so that the downspout discharge travels at least thirty 30 feet over grass before reaching a driveway roadway paved ditch or any other impervious conveyance b42 modular pavement modular pavement consists of strong structural materials typically concrete having regularly interspersed void spaces that are filled with pervious materials such as sand gravel or sod these pavements can be used as driveways or as overflow parking in areas that are used less frequently than the main parking areas for civic commercial and industrial facilities modular pavement can be used for any portion of parking up to that amount allowed by the planning commission infiltration credit any area that is paved using modular pavement can be treated as pervious for purposes of calculating wqv and postdevelopment peak runoff as long as appropriate design criteria and construction specifications are satisfied warren county stormwater guide appendix b   design criteria large void spaces in modular pavement shall represent at least thirty percent 30% of the total surface area of the pavement voids shall be filled with silty soil and vegetated with permanent grass if vegetation is inappropriate voids may be filled with sand or gravel but the material shall be clean and uniform poorly graded to ensure high permeability construction specifications install all modular pavements following manufacturers specifications to prevent premature clogging andor failure modular pavements shall not be placed into service until the entire contributing surface drainage area has been completely stabilized clearly mark the planned area for modular pavement to prevent heavy equipment from compacting the underlying soils excavate the subgrade soil using equipment with tracks or oversized tires to minimize compaction b43 swales swales are typically vegetated parabolic or trapezoidal channels with a large width to depth ratio that are used for conveying storm water runoff swales can act both as vegetated filters and infiltration practices because they tend to slow runoff rates and allow for both particle settling and storm water infiltration swales are encouraged wherever they can be used as an alternative to narrower deeper channels that tend to convey flow at higher velocities swales are especially effective in reducing water quality impacts when used for roadside drainage instead of the traditional curb inletstorm sewer system in this application curb cuts are used instead of drop inlets in the gutter see figure b2 swales can be even more effective when constructed using berms or infiltration beds to encourage additional ponding and infiltration these cases are discussed in subsequent sections infiltration credits when swales are used the infiltration credit is 025 acrefeet per acre of swale to obtain this credit the area draining to the swale must be at least three 3 times the area of the swale considering that the swale itself is part of the drainage area warren county stormwater guide appendix b   to calculate the area of the swale the width will be the average water surface width corresponding to the flowrate associated with the 100year storm design criteria to be considered a swale a channel must have a width to depth ratio of at least  have a bed slope of not greater than four percent 4% and be vegetated when swales are used for roadside drainage curb cuts shall be provided no less frequently than on per each one hundred 100 feet of curb drop inlets in swales shall be spaced no closer than once per each three hundred 300 feet in order to obtain the infiltration credit grassed channels that do not satisfy the design criteria to be considered swales may be given an infiltration credit only for the channel bottom if the bed slope does not exceed four percent 4% b44 bermed swales a bermed swale or infiltration swale is a grassed swale constructed with berms or swale blocks across the swale to impound shallow pools of water slowing flow and providing additional opportunities for particle settling and storm water infiltration infiltration credit infiltration credit for a bermed swale is calculated in the same manner as the credit for a swale except that the calculated infiltration credit can be increased by fifty percent 50% of the water volume that can be impounded by the berms design criteria swale blocks or earthen berms built across the swale shall be constructed with a two 2 inch diameter pvc pipe berm to prevent longterm ponding of water berms shall be no taller than eight 8 inches and spaced no closer than sixty 60 feet drop inlets in swales shall be spaced no closer than once per each three hundred 300 feet in order to obtain the infiltration credit grassed channels that do not satisfy the design criteria to be considered swales may be given an infiltration credit only for the channel bottom if the bed slope does not exceed four 4 percent b45 biofiltration swales a biofiltration swale is a version of a bioretention system without the pipe underdrain system this practice encourages infiltration from the swale bottom planting bed to the underlying soil see figure b3 warren county stormwater guide appendix b   infiltration credit infiltration credit for a biofiltration swale is 050 acrefeet per acre of swale plus one hundred percent 100% of the volume of the ponded water when designed according to the following criteria if biofiltration swales are designed consistent with the procedures for bioretention systems the infiltration credit equals the design treatment volume design criteria biofiltration swales shall be designed to have the following characteristics  trapezoidal or parabolic shape  bottom width of 2 feet  side slopes no steeper than   longitudinal slope of 1 to 2 percent up to 4 percent slope can be used with berms constructed as required for bermed swales  length width depth and slope necessary to provide surface storage of the design volume with a maximum ponded depth of 18 inches  vegetated in accordance with requirements for vegetated channels with grass lining  capacity to convey the 100year design storm with at least 6 inches of freeboard  a soil bed 36 inches deep having the width of the swale bottom plan the soil bed to consist of soils that have a permeability of at least 05 feet per day uscs soils ml sm or sc if native soils do not satisfy this criterion a prepared soil bed can be designed an alternative to the above criteria is to size the filter bed ie planting soil bed for a biofiltration swale consistent with a bioretention system then the infiltration credit would be calculated in the same manner as the credit for bioretention b46 terraforming terraforming is a term for special grading practices such as terracing and berming that are intended to promote infiltration bermed swales are a special case of terraforming terraforming can range from a small depression in permeable soil to an extensive series of bermed terraces a simple example is given in figure b4 infiltration credit the infiltration credit for terraforming is 025 acrefeet per acre of area terraformed plus one hundred percent 100% of the impounded water b47 infiltration basins warren county stormwater guide appendix b   infiltration basins may be used in locations that have at least five 5 feet of soil with a permeability of at least 05 inches per hour underlying the device the underlying five 5 feet of soil must also be above the seasonal high water table if soils do not meet the permeability requirement they can be modified by mixing sand and gravel in the top five 5 feet of the soil underlying the device if native soils are to be modified with sand or gravel provide a design that shows the depth of soil to be modified and the total quantity of gravel or soil to be added include soil test data documenting the permeability of the soils before and after modification if desired large infiltration basins can be designed much like an extended detention pond for storm peak control the outlet structure and detention storage volumes are designed to be above the level needed to store the design wqv the difference is that an infiltration basin does not have an extended detention outlet instead the wqv is allowed to infiltrate into the soils underlying the basin if the infiltration basin is not intended for peak flow control it shall be designed so that volumes exceeding the wqv can discharge overflow weir or pipe for small excavated basins of less than onefourth 14 acre volumes exceeding the wqv may be allowed to overflow onto the ground surface without use of an overflow structure if proper erosion control measures are implemented the infiltration credit for an infiltrated basin is simply the volume designed to be impounded before overflow or discharge to a spillway design criteria test soils prior to designing an infiltration basin to ensure that the site is capable of infiltration obtain a minimum of three 3 soil test borings or test pits to verify that the soil is at least five 5 feet deep below the base elevation and has a permeability of at least 05 inch per hour design the floor of the basin to be as flat as possible to promote infiltration provide side slopes not greater than  hv provide a sediment forebay at the inlet to the basin with a depth of at least four 4 feet and a volume of at least ten percent 10% of the wqv size the basin to store the design wqv before discharging peak flow control outlet if the basin is intended only for water quality treatment design an outlet that allows volumes in excess of the wqv to discharge to a surface water conveyance if a base flow will be discharged into the infiltration basin design a low flow orifice to allow base flow to pass the storage depth so that the basin will completely drain the wqv in seventytwo 72 hours warren county stormwater guide appendix b   when using an infiltration basin for peak flow control provide a minimum of one 1 foot of freeboard above the 100year design storm high water elevation impoundment depths shall not exceed fifteen 15 feet and storage volumes shall not exceed twentyfive 25 acrefeet design earthen embankments with side slopes not steeper than  horizontal to vertical design basins to be placed outside the receiving stream except when a basin is designed as a regional detention basin and warren county public works has approved its use as a regional basin reserve adequate access from public or private rightofway by establishing a maintenance easement design the access to be at least ten 10 feet wide with a slope not greater than  hv design the access way to connect to the embankment so that equipment can access the top of the embankment on a slope not greater than  hv provide a minimum twentyfive 25foot wide buffer strip between the basin and the nearest lot landscape the buffer strip with lowmaintenance native grasses shrubs and trees provide a landscaping plan for the basin and the buffer objectives of landscaping include improving the appearance for adjacent residents and providing wildlife habitat specifications embankment outlet and emergency spillway specifications are consistent with those for detention basins excavate the basin with light equipment having tracks or oversized tires to minimize compaction of the underlying soils after the basin is excavated to the final design depth deeply till the basin floor with a rotary tiller or disc harrow to restore infiltration rates after tilling apply a leveling drag establish vegetation immediately after achieving final grade and preparing the infiltration bed stabilize the floor of the basin with a dense cover of watertolerant herbaceous species consistent with requirements of bioretention systems b48 vegetated filter strips a vegetated filter is a practice that relies upon the use of vegetation to filter out sediment and other pollutants from storm water runoff these filters also provide an opportunity for storm water runoff to infiltrate vegetated filters can be used as water quality devices vegetated filters can be used for small subareas of a larger development in order to reduce the total volume to be treated by other devices in the development warren county stormwater guide appendix b   a filter strip is a practice that relies upon sheet flow across the entire width of the vegetated area the vegetation is typically grass  however other ground cover can be used if it provides for dense vegetation filter strips are typically used at the edge of a parking lot or other paved surface design criteria design a filter strip to have a width matching the width of the area draining to the filter design a filter strip to have a smooth transition with the area draining to it so that sheet flow can be developed across the filter design filter strips to have a minimum slope of two percent 2% and a maximum slope of six percent 6% provide a dense turf or other comparable vegetated ground cover over the whole filter area when the contributing area draining to the filter strip is impervious do not allow the overland flow length of the impervious surface to exceed seventyfive 75 feet when the contributing area draining to the filter strip is pervious do not allow the overland flow length of the contributing surface to exceed one hundred fifty 150 feet infiltration credit the infiltration credit for vegetated filters is  acrefeet per acre of filter b5 sand and organic filters in general usage storm water filters are a diverse group of techniques for treating storm water quality with each using some sort of filtering media such as sand soil gravel peat compost or vegetation filters will include systems with a designed filter bed composed of sand gravel compost or peat and an outlet to the storm water drainage system or a receiving stream systems described in this section include surface sand filters underground sand filters perimeter sand filters and organic filters b51 applicability filters can be used for water quality treatment but are not appropriate for peak flow quantity control b52 general design criteria design criteria in this section apply to all filtration devices in this section warren county stormwater guide appendix b   provide a pretreatment cell to allow sedimentation prior to the filter bed and reduce clogging locate inlet and outlet structures at extreme ends of the pretreatment cell design the pretreatment or sedimentation cell to have a minimum depth of three 3 feet to minimize resuspension and turbulence design the bottom of the pretreatment cell to be nearly level to facilitate sedimentation design the surface area of the pretreatment cell in square feet to be at least  times the wqv in cubic feet for areas with seventyfive percent 75% or more impervious surface for areas with less than seventyfive percent 75% impervious surface design the surface area of the pretreatment cell in square feet to be at least  times the wqv in cubic feet the order of magnitude difference in the two factors derives from the fact that areas with higher percentages of impervious surface ie seventyfive percent 75% or more tend to have a greater proportion of coarsegrained sediments which have a higher settling velocity size the pretreatment cell with a minimum length to width ratio of  the length to width ratio of the pretreatment cell can be less than  if baffles are provided to obtain a flow length equivalent to or greater than would be obtained with a  ratio design each filtering

sedimentation chamber and a filter bed chamber with a sand filter and underdrain system figure b5 also shows a flow diversion chamber at the inlet end of the structure the filter bed has an eighteen 18inch to twenty four 24inch sand layer which traps or strains pollutants before runoff is collected in an underdrain system gravel and perforated pipe and conveyed to the receiving stream channel or pipe the filter bed surface may have sand or grass cover surface sand filters are open at the top which provides easy access for maintenance but renders these unsuitable in areas easily accessible to the general public especially small children control access to surface sand filters by enclosing them in an eight 8foot chain link fence such a configuration is most suitable to industrial and warehousing facilities rather than commercialretail establishments where aesthetic impact is significant even for industrial sites consider proximity to residential areas and other locations

48 figure b14 49 figure b15 50 warren county stormwater guide appendix b   b1 introduction nonpoint source pollution is now responsible for up to eighty percent 80% of pollution in waters of the us which include streams lakes rivers and wetlands this is true in part due to significant reductions in direct discharges of pollutants by industry that have been achieved since passage of the clean water act cwa of 1972 in urban areas nonpoint source pollution occurs because storm water runoff collects impurities while passing over rooftops streets parking lots landscaping and gutters this polluted storm water runoff typically enters a storm drain system and is rapidly conveyed to a lake stream or river the percentage of impervious land cover in urban and suburban watersheds generally indicates the level of pollutant impact on receiving waters in most cases impervious cover in excess of thirty percent 30% results in streams that are considered degraded while impervious cover between ten and thirty percent 10% 30% causes impacts on the receiving streams typical residential development results in approximately thirtyfive percent 35% of a watershed being impervious which is more than enough to degrade the receiving waters realization of this fact is important because healthy nonimpacted streams are important for a healthy ecosystem and a healthy ecosystem is important for all living creatures including people in warren county the karst cave system has been utilized often overly so to manage storm water runoff utilization of karst for storm water management is not an exact science it is often difficult to predict the exact pathways of underground streams and thus the impact of introducing increased runoff to downstream locations we have also come to realize that the karst system has limits and see this in the form of basins that do not readily drain or may even surcharge when the cave system is full a second byproduct of utilizing the karst for storm water drainage is the almost immediate introduction of contaminates into our water systems fertilizers and other chemicals that are used on lawns are carried directly into storm sewers then into basins and often into drywells and sinkhole boxes with no treatment ultimately these toxins travel into our ground water streams lakes effecting wildlife and our source drinking water to protect our natural resources the cwa of 197 as amended in 198 prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of the us and mandates that storm water not be discharged unless it is in compliance with a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit bowling green and warren county are responsible for ensuring that discharges of storm water from pubic storm water systems into waters of the state comply with cwa requirements the implementation of the requirements contained in this manual will be a primary mechanism for accomplishing this objective warren county stormwater guide appendix b   storm water management in bowling greenwarren county shall include management for quality as well as quantity flood protection this storm water appendix is intended as a guide only to provide information on the structural water quality and water quantity best management practices bmps permanent water quality treatment measures described in this chapter should not be confused with erosion and sediment controls required during construction b2 general design criteria storm water management in bowling greenwarren county shall include management for quality and quantity this section provides the general design criteria for both b21 water quantity control water quantity controls shall be implemented so that postdevelopment peak discharges do not exceed predevelopment discharges for those storms listed in table b1 b22 water quality controls research has indicated that capturing and treating eighty percent 80% of the total annual runoff volume provides effective water quality treatment volume based on removal of particulates effective removal of solid particles in the runoff also provides for removal of significant amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and oil and grease ninety percent 90% of the annual runoff seems to be a large volume but the storm events that cumulatively produce this runoff volume in warren county produce less than 10 inches of runoff each using historical rainfall records typical soil parameters and the swmm model the runoff depth necessary for eighty percent 80% runoff capture was approximated as a function of percent impervious area these values which are shown in table b1 represent the water quality depth that shall be treated for each development for example a twenty 20acre development that is forty percent 40% impervious has a water quality depth of 07 inches over the whole area not just the impervious area resulting in a water quality volume wqv of 50820 cubic feet in addition to carrying pollutants storm water runoff from developed areas increases the frequency and duration of bankfull flows in the receiving streams causing increased erosion of the stream banks and further degradation of instream water quality onsite infiltration designed for the increased runoff due to development is the preferred solution to this impact warren county stormwater guide appendix b   table b1 water quality depth versus percent

are not required for sites that are less than ten percent 10% impervious b3 bioretention systems bioretention is a practice to treat storm water runoff using a conditioned planting soil bed and planting materials to filter runoff stored within a shallow depression the method combines physical filtering and absorption with biological processes the system consists of a structure to spread flow a pretreatment filter strip or grass channel a sand bed pea gravel overflow curtain drain a shallow ponding area a surface organic layer of mulch a planting soil bed plant material a gravel underdrain system and an overflow system figure b1 shows a diagram of a bioretention system designed to receive runoff from a paved area b31 applicability bioretention systems are very effective for water quality treatment bioretention systems are particularly well suited for use in parking lot islands roadside swales and median strips warren county stormwater guide appendix b   b32 design criteria

b4 infiltration systems infiltration practices andor bioretention systems reduce the adverse impacts on the receiving waters that result from increasing the impervious area this chapter describes several infiltration practices that can be used in many different situations many of the practices cannot function as the sole water quality infiltration and treatment device but will provide significant credits toward reducing the magnitude of the runoff that must be detained and treated infiltration practices include a variety of practices such as directing downspouts to grassed areas and using modular pavement infiltration practices also include swales terraforming infiltration and vegetative filters terraforming is a term for special grading practices such as terracing and berming that are intended to promote infiltration this section presents infiltration practices and describes the minimum requirements that must be met to obtain credits to reduce water quality treatment volumes the infiltration volume credit listed for each practice can be used to satisfy an equal amount of water quality volume b41 downspouts to grass discharging downspouts from roofs onto grassed yards encourages infiltration and reduces direct discharge to impervious areas such as driveways the grass area shall be greater than or equal to the roof area infiltration credit when downspouts are discharged onto grass the infiltration credit is  acrefeet per acre of roof area design criteria the lot must be graded so that the downspout discharge travels at least thirty 30 feet over grass before reaching a driveway roadway paved ditch or any other impervious conveyance b42 modular pavement modular pavement consists of strong structural materials typically concrete having regularly interspersed void spaces that are filled with pervious materials such as sand gravel or sod these pavements can be used as driveways or as overflow parking in areas that are used less frequently than the main parking areas for civic commercial and industrial facilities modular pavement can be used for any portion of parking up to that amount allowed by the planning commission infiltration credit any area that is paved using modular pavement can be treated as pervious for purposes of calculating wqv and postdevelopment peak runoff as long as appropriate design criteria and construction specifications are satisfied warren county stormwater guide appendix b   design criteria large void spaces in modular pavement shall represent at least thirty percent 30% of the total surface area of the pavement voids shall be filled with silty soil and vegetated with permanent grass if vegetation is inappropriate voids may be filled with sand or gravel but the material shall be clean and uniform poorly graded to ensure high permeability construction specifications install all modular pavements following manufacturers specifications to prevent premature clogging andor failure modular pavements shall not be placed into service until the entire contributing surface drainage area has been completely stabilized clearly mark the planned area for modular pavement to prevent heavy equipment from compacting the underlying soils excavate the subgrade soil using equipment with tracks or oversized tires to minimize compaction b43 swales swales are typically vegetated parabolic or trapezoidal channels with a large width to depth ratio that are used for conveying storm water runoff swales can act both as vegetated filters and infiltration practices because they tend to slow runoff rates and allow for both particle settling and storm water infiltration swales are encouraged wherever they can be used as an alternative to narrower deeper channels that tend to convey flow at higher velocities swales are especially effective in reducing water quality impacts when used for roadside drainage instead of the traditional curb inletstorm sewer system in this application curb cuts are used instead of drop inlets in the gutter see figure b2 swales can be even more effective when constructed using berms or infiltration beds to encourage additional ponding and infiltration these cases are discussed in subsequent sections infiltration credits when swales are used the infiltration credit is 025 acrefeet per acre of swale to obtain this credit the area draining to the swale must be at least three 3 times the area of the swale considering that the swale itself is part of the drainage area warren county stormwater guide appendix b   to calculate the area of the swale the width will be the average water surface width corresponding to the flowrate associated with the 100year storm design criteria to be considered a swale a channel must have a width to depth ratio of at least  have a bed slope of not greater than four percent 4% and be vegetated when swales are used for roadside drainage curb cuts shall be provided no less frequently than on per each one hundred 100 feet of curb drop inlets in swales shall be spaced no closer than once per each three hundred 300 feet in order to obtain the infiltration credit grassed channels that do not satisfy the design criteria to be considered swales may be given an infiltration credit only for the channel bottom if the bed slope does not exceed four percent 4% b44 bermed swales a bermed swale or infiltration swale is a grassed swale constructed with berms or swale blocks across the swale to impound shallow pools of water slowing flow and providing additional opportunities for particle settling and storm water infiltration infiltration credit infiltration credit for a bermed swale is calculated in the same manner as the credit for a swale except that the calculated infiltration credit can be increased by fifty percent 50% of the water volume that can be impounded by the berms design criteria swale blocks or earthen berms built across the swale shall be constructed with a two 2 inch diameter pvc pipe berm to prevent longterm ponding of water berms shall be no taller than eight 8 inches and spaced no closer than sixty 60 feet drop inlets in swales shall be spaced no closer than once per each three hundred 300 feet in order to obtain the infiltration credit grassed channels that do not satisfy the design criteria to be considered swales may be given an infiltration credit only for the channel bottom if the bed slope does not exceed four 4 percent b45 biofiltration swales a biofiltration swale is a version of a bioretention system without the pipe underdrain system this practice encourages infiltration from the swale bottom planting bed to the underlying soil see figure b3 warren county stormwater guide appendix b   infiltration credit infiltration credit for a biofiltration swale is 050 acrefeet per acre of swale plus one hundred percent 100% of the volume of the ponded water when designed according to the following criteria if biofiltration swales are designed consistent with the procedures for bioretention systems the infiltration credit equals the design treatment volume design criteria biofiltration swales shall be designed to have the following characteristics  trapezoidal or parabolic shape  bottom width of 2 feet  side slopes no steeper than   longitudinal slope of 1 to 2 percent up to 4 percent slope can be used with berms constructed as required for bermed swales  length width depth and slope necessary to provide surface storage of the design volume with a maximum ponded depth of 18 inches  vegetated in accordance with requirements for vegetated channels with grass lining  capacity to convey the 100year design storm with at least 6 inches of freeboard  a soil bed 36 inches deep having the width of the swale bottom plan the soil bed to consist of soils that have a permeability of at least 05 feet per day uscs soils ml sm or sc if native soils do not satisfy this criterion a prepared soil bed can be designed an alternative to the above criteria is to size the filter bed ie planting soil bed for a biofiltration swale consistent with a bioretention system then the infiltration credit would be calculated in the same manner as the credit for bioretention b46 terraforming terraforming is a term for special grading practices such as terracing and berming that are intended to promote infiltration bermed swales are a special case of terraforming terraforming can range from a small depression in permeable soil to an extensive series of bermed terraces a simple example is given in figure b4 infiltration credit the infiltration credit for terraforming is 025 acrefeet per acre of area terraformed plus one hundred percent 100% of the impounded water b47 infiltration basins warren county stormwater guide appendix b   infiltration basins may be used in locations that have at least five 5 feet of soil with a permeability of at least 05 inches per hour underlying the device the underlying five 5 feet of soil must also be above the seasonal high water table if soils do not meet the permeability requirement they can be modified by mixing sand and gravel in the top five 5 feet of the soil underlying the device if native soils are to be modified with sand or gravel provide a design that shows the depth of soil to be modified and the total quantity of gravel or soil to be added include soil test data documenting the permeability of the soils before and after modification if desired large infiltration basins can be designed much like an extended detention pond for storm peak control the outlet structure and detention storage volumes are designed to be above the level needed to store the design wqv the difference is that an infiltration basin does not have an extended detention outlet instead the wqv is allowed to infiltrate into the soils underlying the basin if the infiltration basin is not intended for peak flow control it shall be designed so that volumes exceeding the wqv can discharge overflow weir or pipe for small excavated basins of less than onefourth 14 acre volumes exceeding the wqv may be allowed to overflow onto the ground surface without use of an overflow structure if proper erosion control measures are implemented the infiltration credit for an infiltrated basin is simply the volume designed to be impounded before overflow or discharge to a spillway design criteria test soils prior to designing an infiltration basin to ensure that the site is capable of infiltration obtain a minimum of three 3 soil test borings or test pits to verify that the soil is at least five 5 feet deep below the base elevation and has a permeability of at least 05 inch per hour design the floor of the basin to be as flat as possible to promote infiltration provide side slopes not greater than  hv provide a sediment forebay at the inlet to the basin with a depth of at least four 4 feet and a volume of at least ten percent 10% of the wqv size the basin to store

kcl05 where q   discharge ft3s a   crosssectional area of pipe ft2 g   322 feet s2 h   head above discharge end of pipe ft2 ke   entrance loss coefficient kb   bend loss coefficient 0 for no bends kc   head loss coefficient for pipe l   pipe length feet  assume that the design wqv is placed above the permanent pool and calculate the corresponding height above the permanent pool this is the head valve h corresponding to the wqv calculate the discharge q at 025foot intervals from the top of the design wqv extended detention pool to the bottom of the extended detention pool ie top of permanent pool calculate the average discharge for each 025foot increment by averaging the q calculated at the top and bottom of each increment use the stagestorage curve for the ponds to determine the storage volume in cubic feet corresponding to each 025foot increment of depth divide each incremental storage volume by its corresponding average discharge to calculate the time required for each incremental volume to be discharged selected pipe warren county stormwater guide appendix b   sum the incremental discharge durations to determine if the total design wqv required twentyfour 24 hours to discharge if not adjust the pipe size and recalculate b94 specifications specifications are consistent with those provided in b10 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands can provide a very effective management measure for mitigation of pollution from runoff because they have the ability to assimilate large quantities of suspended and dissolved materials from inflow the term constructed wetland can apply to a wetland which is constructed to mitigate impacts to a natural wetland per a corps of engineers permit or a wetland which is constructed as part of a wastewater treatment system in this manual a constructed wetland is advised to be constructed in accordance with the following criteria and procedures to treat and control storm water b101 applicability constructed wetlands can be used for both water quality and water quantity management or for water quality only for management of water quantity a wetland would be constructed much like a wet pond with a six 6 to twelve 12 inch deep permanent pool the most important criterion in determining whether a constructed wetland is applicable is the existence of a base flow that can be used to supply the permanent pool b102 design criteria for water control size the extended detention pool above the permanent pool equal to the design wqv design the extended detention outlet so that at least twentyfour 24 hours would be required to release the design wqv to calculate the design wqv take the full wqv for the site minus any credits allowed for infiltration and bioretention for storm water quantity control determine the necessary detention volume and design the peak control outlet consistent with the design criteria and design procedures for detention ponds in the extended detention volume is a portion of the total detention volume rather than being an addition to it size the surface area of the wetland according to procedures described in the following section warren county stormwater guide appendix b   provide a sediment forebay design the forebay to be four 4 to six 6 feet deep and have a volume of at least ten percent 10% of the design wqv at the inlet to the constructed wetland use a reverse slope pipe as the extended detention outlet and protect it from blockage using aggregate as shown in figure b15 provide a micropool at the extended detention outlet so that the reverse slope outlet pipe can be placed one 1 foot below the permanent pool surface design the micropool to be four 4 to six 6 feet deep with a volume of at least ten percent 10% of the wqv provide a drain with a valve at the base of the micropool design the permanent pool with the exception of the sediment forebay and the outlet micorpool to be three 3 to twelve 12 inches deep with an average depth of six 6 to nine 9 inches design the grades in the constructed wetland so that the wetland will drain to the micropool at the outlet if the micropool is drained providing the ability to drain the wetland will facilitate maintenance and revegetation if necessary design the wetland to have low marsh and high marsh in the permanent pool low marsh refers to a zone with six 6 to twelve 12 inches of permanent pool while high marsh refers to a zone with zero to six 6 inches of permanent pool design the wetland so that low marsh and high marsh each represent thirtyfive to fortyfive percent 35 45% of the total surface area design so that the total deep pool ie the micropool plus the sediment forebay represent ten to twenty percent 1020% of the surface area design the wetland to have a length to width ratio of at least  reverse adequate access from public or private rightofway by establishing a maintenance easement design the access to be at least ten 10 feet wide and no steeper than  hv design the easement to provide access to the sediment forebay and the outlet micropool check the velocity of design storm flows at the inlet to the wetland and provide a stable entrance to prevent erosion design a planting plan that shows forty to fifty percent 4050% of the shallow twelve 12 inches or less wetland planted with wetland vegetation a list of suitable species is available from the kentucky division of water plan to include a minimum of three emergent wetland species as the majority planting with at least three 3 additional emergent species comprising the remaining planting warren county stormwater guide appendix b   b103 design procedures use table b2 to determine the minimum surface area required based upon the size of the watershed draining to the wetland values in table b2 are based upon expected nitrogen and phosphorus loading rates in urban areas and the maximum loading per acre that a constructed wetland can effectively treat procedures for sizing the reverse slope pipe outlet at the
