to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain as follows this article shall be known and may be cited as the flood prevention ordinance of the city    146507 and shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the citys jurisdiction sec i 1951 adopted  of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage sec i 1952 adopted  of purpose  methods of reducing flood losses a it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in special flood hazard areas this article is designed to regulate restrict uses of land that cause increases in flood heights or velocities and to prevent the construction of barriers which will divert floodwaters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards provisions of this article are designed to do the following 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly floodcontrol projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area b in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands sec i 1953 adopted  152019   147507 this article is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this article and another ordinance easement covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail sec i 1954

evidence before it including information studies and court decisions from other jurisdictions the city council makes the following legislative findings and statement of purpose the council recognizes that some activities which occur in connection with sexually oriented businesses are protected as expression under the first amendment to the united states constitution the council further recognizes the first amendment rights are    188507 among our most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights the council is aware however that sexually oriented businesses may and do generate secondary effects which are detrimental to the public health safety and welfare among these secondary effects are a prostitution and other sexrelated offenses b drug use and dealing c health risks spread of aids and other sexually transmitted diseases and d infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of drug and sexrelated business activities laundering of money and other illicit conduct this article is not intended to interfere with legitimate expression but to avoid and mitigate the secondary effects enumerated above specifically the council finds that licensing of persons who operate and manage sexually oriented businesses and persons who provide adult services will further the goals of this article by enabling the city to ascertain if an applicant is underage or has engaged in criminal or other behavior of the sort this article is designed to limit this information will enable the city to allocate law enforcement resources effectively and otherwise protect the community the council finds that limiting proximity and contact between adult service providers and patrons promotes the goal of reducing prostitution and other casual sexual conduct and the attendant risk of sexually transmitted diseases the council finds the foregoing to be true with respect to places where alcohol is served and where it is not the council finds that individual and interactive sexual activities in adult video facilities pose a risk of sexually transmitted disease especially aids and that the open booth requirement of this article will reduce that risk the council finds that the harmful secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses are more pronounced when conducted continuously or during latenight hours the fees established for licenses and permits in this article are based on the estimated cost of implementation administration and enforcement of the licensing program 2000 sec 7301 the following words terms

use management plan the following water conservation and drought contingency plans as set forth below the city commits to implementing this program according to the procedures set forth in the adopted plans a the purpose of the water use management plan is to promote the wise and responsible use of water to enhance the sustainability of longterm water supplies and to minimize the adverse impacts of water supply emergencies by providing and supporting public information and education programs that encourage customers to voluntarily pursue water conservation and protection measures in both residential and business activities  by developing maintaining and enforcing water management policies and ordinances  by implementing structural programs that result in quantifiable water conservation results  and by implementing a droughtemergency contingency plan when necessary to ensure adequate water supplies for public health and safety b the citys service area is located within the llano estacado regional water planning area of the texas water development board and the city will provide a copy of the citys water use management plan to the llano estacado regional water planning group to assure consistency with the regional water plan c the city will implement a detailed plan for each of the four steps in the drought contingency measures including water use strategies the target of these strategies will be to maintain daily water demand at or below 50 percent of the available water production capability in the event of severe drought or major infrastructure failures certain water uses may be restricted by the city manager or hisher designee as outlined in this plan the following words and phrases as used in this article shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section unless the context clearly indicates otherwise aesthetic water use water use for ornamental or decorative purposes such as fountains reflecting pools and water gardens    383507 conservation those practices techniques and technologies that reduce the consumption of water reduce the loss or waste of water improve efficiency in the use of water or increase the recycling and reuse of water so that a supply is conserved and made available for future or alternative use customer any individual corporation partnership association and any other legal entity utilizing water provided by the city domestic water use water use for personal needs or for household or sanitary purposes such as drinking bathing heating cooking sanitation or for cleaning a residence business industry or institution except as provided under the definition of nonessential water use drought an extended period of time of below normal precipitation rainfall snow etc landscape irrigation use water use for irrigation and maintenance of landscaped areas whether publicly or privately owned including residential and commercial lawns gardens golf courses parks and rightsofway and medians nonessential water use nonessential water use consists of washing house windows sidings eaves and roof with hose and without the use of a bucket  washing driveways streets curbs and gutters  washing vehicles without a cutoff valve and a bucket  unattended sprinkling of landscape shrubs and grass  draining and filling swimming pools  and flushing water system conservation plan the water conservation plan as adopted by the city consists of the following 1 continuing public education and information programs the city will inform the city users of various recommended methods for implementing a reduction in water consumption the city will provide talks and programs to schools and civic organizations along with distributing materials which are available from the texas water development board and other agencies in accordance with the citys administrative policy on water conservation plan continuing education and information programs 2 plumbing codes the state law requires that cities and utilities with a population of 5000 or more adopt a standard plumbing code or a water saving plumbing code for new construction and for replacement of plumbing fixtures in existing structures the city has adopted the 2015 edition of the international plumbing adopted by the international 3 water conservation retrofit program title v of the health and safety chapter 372 requires that businesses stock and sell only plumbing fixtures which conform to water saving performance standards this will ensure that plumbing fixtures installed during new construction and remodeling will be of the conservation oriented type the city will advise customers regarding retrofit devices such as lowflow shower heads toilet dams faucet aerators etc that reduce water use by replacing or modifying existing fixtures 4 conservation oriented water rate structure the city has adopted an ascending block rate structure which will further discourage the wasteful use of large quantities of water the city is now relating sewer charges to water consumption with a 14000 gallon ceiling on singlefamily residential 5 universal metering and meter repair and replacement all connections to the water supply system in the city are metered the city is testing and replacing meters on an ongoing basis concentrating on the largest meters first meter readers classify the apparent conditions of all city meters and repairs are initiated in areas with poor classification universal metering will continue after adoption of this plan a the citys production meters are located at the water treatment plant and on all cityowned groundwater wells the city uses these meters to report its groundwater production b service meters larger than two inches 2 will be tested every two years service meters two inches 2 and smaller will be tested at least once every ten years the city has installed a service meter to measure water used for backwash at the water treatment plant    384507 6 water conserving landscaping educational material will include information relating to low water use landscaping the city reviews and approves subdivision plans at the time building permits are acquired developers will be provided with literature pertaining to low water demand landscaping items nurseries and local businesses will also be provided with this literature 7 leak detection and repair the citys system uses a 12month moving total of water treated and pumped versus water sold in order to assess more accurately the amount of unaccounted for water losses in the system the average unaccounted for water has ranged from 11% to 15% in previous years leaks that go unreported for extended periods of time or large pipe failures that make for difficult estimates of total water loss can skew these numbers from yeartoyear the city will continue to refine our methods of calculating water loss due to these issues to better understand our actual unaccounted for water loss a the city has almost immediate response to reports of water leaks which minimizes water waste the city is conducting audits to identify connections which bypass city meters and correct those which are found b the city will continue to monitor monthly consumption classification of meter condition provides a reliable and effective leak detection program the city is also aware that assistance in leak detecting surveys can be obtained from the texas water development board staff 8 specific quantified 5 and 10year targets a the citys average daily water usage is approximately 135 gpcd notwithstanding changes in the citys water usage citizens and businesses can reduce water usage by implementing water conservation practices the citys water conservation goals are to i reduce annual per capita water usage to 132 gallons per person per day or by 25 percent by the year 2024 ii reduce annual per capita water use to 128 gallons person per day or by 5 percent by the year 2029 b this should be accomplished information programs a conservation retrofit program conservation oriented water rate structure and metering as well as a meter repair and replacement program 9 recycling and reuse the city will investigate reuse and recycling programs where legally possible and economically feasible water reclamation at the wastewater treatment plant is being done by the city current uses for reclaimed water include plant washdown water and onsite irrigation the city is studying additional uses such as offsite irrigation 10 prorata water allocation in the event that the city is in a severe water shortage as specified in threshold conditions of the drought contingency plan the city manager is hereby authorized to initiate allocation of water supplies on a prorata basis in accordance with texas water section  11 implementation and enforcement the city staff will implement the water conservation plan in accordance with the city councils adoption of the plan plumbing

drought contingency plan in addition every wholesale water contract entered into or renewed after adoption of the plan including contract extensions must agree that in case of a water shortage resulting from drought the water to be distributed shall be divided in accordance with texas water section     385507 contingency and emergency plan the drought contingency plan as adopted by the city is as follows 1 threshold conditions there are four classifications of drought conditions or trigger conditions for determining the degree of urgency for initiation of a drought contingency plan the triggering criteria below are based on an evaluation of the historical water system capacities and customer use patterns as well as a consideration of the impact of drought emergencies and high use upon capacities and patterns these four classificationsconditions are as follows a mild water shortage i the average daily water consumption reaches approximately 50% of the available water production capacity and has been that high for a period of three days  and ii weather conditions indicate that high use is likely to continue b moderate water shortage i the average daily water consumption reaches approximately 70% of the rated available water production capacity for a threeday period  ii weather conditions indicate mild water shortage will exist for five days or more  or iii a mechanical failure of pumping equipment which will require more than 24 hours to repair occurs when a mild water shortage is in progress c severe water shortage i average daily water consumption reaches approximately 90% of available water production capacity for a period of three days  ii average daily water consumption will not enable storage levels to be maintained  iii system demand exceeds available high service pump capacity  or iv a mechanical failure of pumping equipment which will require more than 12 hours to repair occurs when a moderate drought is in progress d emergency condition i the canadian river municipal water authority crmwa system fails and the water cannot be delivered to the city  ii the water system is contaminated either accidentally or intentionally  or iii the water system fails from acts of god tornadoes hurricanes etc or man an emergency condition is treated like a severe water shortage drought 2 water shortage contingency measures the city manager or hisher designee shall monitor water supply and in accordance with the triggering criteria set forth in subsection 1 above shall determine that mild moderate or severe water shortage conditions exist or that an emergency condition exists and shall implement the following plan the city shall notify the executive director of the texas commission on environmental quality tceq as soon as possible to notify the director that mandatory provisions of this plan have been implemented a step i curtailment shall be initiated upon existence of mild water shortage conditions and will include the following actions    386507 i develop information center and designate information person ii advise public of condition and publicize availability of information from the information center iii encourage voluntary reduction of water use iv contact commercial and industrial users and explain necessity for initiation of strict conservation methods v implement system oversight and make adjustments as required to meet changing conditions vi target raise public awareness of the situation and maintain daily water demand at or below 50 percent of available water production capacity b step ii curtailment shall be initiated by the city manager on identifying moderate water shortage conditions the listed actions are compulsory on users and are intended to prohibit nonessential water use i outdoor residential use of water will be permitted on alternate days evennumbered houses will use water for outdoor residential uses on even days of the month and oddnumbered houses on odd days of the month outdoor residential uses consist of washing vehicles boats trailers landscape sprinkler systems and irrigation recreational use of sprinklers outside showers in parks and water slides ii the city manager or hisher designee will monitor system function and establish hours for outside water use depending upon system performance iii the information center and publicity elements shall keep the public advised of curtailment status iv commercial and industrial users will be visited to ensure that conservation measures have been initiated v target reduce and maintain daily water

sanitary purposes these nonessential uses include street washing watering of parks fire hydrant flow testing filling swimming pools watering athletic fields and courses and dust control sprinkling iii commercial uses not listed will be controlled to the extent dictated by the city manager iv target reduce and maintain daily water demand at or below 90 percent of available water production capacity or in any emergency condition of system outages due to equipment failure temporarily discontinue water system operating d step iv curtailment shall be initiated upon the existence of an emergency condition as determined by the city manager the listed actions are compulsory on users i all aesthetic and nonessential water use including landscape irrigation use is prohibited except where necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of the public no new landscape material may be installed    387507 ii all city operations will adhere to the water use restrictions iii the city may

water treatment plant by crmwa the wells are located in different areas of the city and are powered by different electrical sources a portion of the wells should be operational at any given time the treatment plant can be completely operational without power provided by the electric company as long as water is supplied by crmwa b with these two water sources it is highly unlikely that both sources would be out at the same time if that should happen water would be trucked into the city from other sources and in accordance with state guidelines 6 information and education a the public will be made aware of water conservation and drought conditions by information and data transferred citys program during periods of water shortage curtailment step i conditions will establish an information center an information person and utilize the most effective methods developed for information dissemination on a daily basis b close observation of the first year information program

will affect curtailment give notice publicize and followup with implementation of curtailment 8 termination notification termination of each water shortage condition will begin when conditions have improved to the extent that an upgraded condition can be declared by the city manager this process will be employed until full service can be provided system priority will be considered in returning to upgraded condition termination will be initiated by the city manager by giving notice etc as was given to enact water shortage curtailment 9 variances the city manager may in writing grant a temporary variance for existing water uses otherwise prohibited under this plan if it is determined that failure to grant such variance would cause an emergency condition adversely affecting the health sanitation or fire protection for the public or the person requesting such variance and if one or more of the following conditions are met    388507 a compliance with this plan cannot be

applicability a purpose because there are locations within the city where development has existed for generations the application of new regulations to existing development will create situations in which existing lot dimensions land uses building structures and signs do not strictly comply with the new ordinance even though they complied with the regulations at the time they were permitted and constructed the fact that these nonconformities were at one time conforming means that they are now considered legally nonconforming and therefore will be permitted to continue without immediate retrofit or removal until significant site or land use changes are proposed this article sets out equitable rules for whether when and how the regulations of this chapter apply to existing development

therefore if the community is comfortable with a particular use the classification nonconformity and restriction on investment may not be what the community desires under such conditions the use may be mitigated and made conforming to remove the stigma associated with the designation as a nonconformity the provisions of this section establish procedures for bringing nonconformities into conformance b procedure an owner of a nonconforming use may apply for a special use permit which has the effect of making the nonconforming use conforming c criteria for approval a nonconformity shall be approved as a conformity if in addition to the criteria for approval of a special use permit see section  the following is demonstrated 1 minimal nonconformity the use as conducted and managed has been integrated into the neighborhoods function evaluation criteria include a the neighborhood residents regularly patronize or are employed at said use for nonresidential uses b management practices eliminate nuisances such as noise light waste materials congested onstreet parking or similar conflicts a history of complaints is justification for denying a special use permit request unless the conditions of the permit will eliminate the nuisances c the use has been maintained in good condition or its classification as a nonconformity represents a disincentive for such maintenance    473507
