abandoned gasoline service stations findings a the city council finds and determines that there exist closed vacant and inoperative automobile service stations constituting nonuser as the word nonuser is defined in this chapter and that there is now a need for further control over the lack of utilization condition and appearance of such facilities b it is further found and determined as follows 1 the ordinances of the city in pursuance of protection of the health and safety of the community require that after underground storage tanks used for flammable or combustible liquids are taken out of service for a period of one year such tanks shall be properly disposed of by removal or by being permanently filled when the required action is completed the service station is rendered unusable 2 closed vacant and inoperative automobile service stations constituting nonuser cannot be reasonably expected to be utilized for the purposes originally established inasmuch as the cost of restoring permanently filled underground fuel storage tanks or replacing fuel storage tanks underground for ones which have been removed as excessive 3 automobile service stations cannot be readily adapted for use as other commercial facilities without excessive cost due to their unique location on the property with respect to property lines their unique architectural design and their unique functional layout on the property 4 because of cost and design considerations closed vacant and inoperative automobile service stations constituting nonuser cannot be reasonably expected to be utilized for the purposes originally established or adapted for other permitted uses or moved for use elsewhere and the existence of such conditions contravene the purposes of the zoning ordinances and the general plan of the city in that planning for a compatible blend of land uses will be disrupted because the lands affected cannot be reasonably put to other uses until the existing conditions are abated by restoration or removal of the buildings and also in that planning for other uses will be prevented unless such abatement is accomplished 5 the existence of closed vacant and inoperative automobile service station sites constituting nonuser is injurious and inimical to the public health safety comfort and welfare of the community in that such conditions invite unsightliness blight fire hazards infestation decreasing values to surrounding properties and vandalism and the existence of conditions which invite such ills constitute such abuses of property as to entitle this city to exercise its police powers in order to protect the health safety comfort and welfare of the community and of its residents 6 the provisions of this chapter are categorically exempt under this citys adopted

safeguarding the public health safety comfort and welfare of the community abatement is now required of closed vacant and inoperative automobile service stations which constitute nonuser d it is further found and determined that the exercise of the citys police powers for the abatement of such conditions is reasonably encompassed within the authorizations granted by of the california civil procedure  by et seq 5 of the california government   by of the california constitution  and that the existence of the conditions heretofore described are also encompassed within the meaning of a nuisance as stated in of the california civil it is further found and determined that unless corrective measures are undertaken to alleviate such present conditions and particularly to avoid future problems in this regard a serious threat to the public health safety comfort and welfare of the residents and a serious threat to the values of surrounding properties in this city will continue to exist  that the need of the city of death with conditions under the procedures herein established outweighs the utility of the conditions as they exist  and that the procedures established hereby for

selected the employer shall not send additional survey forms to employees beyond the original sample group such additional surveys invalidate the result of the survey and void the employers option to utilize the random sample method 4 a high response rate is critical to ensure that the random sample produces an accurate avr for the worksite the employer should make a concerted effort to obtain a completed survey form from each employee in the sample all nonrespondents in the sample will be treated as drive alone commuters ie commuting in a single occupant vehicle for purposes of calculating the worksite avr 5 basic random sample selection methodology a the employer shall compile a complete list of employees at the worksite in alphabetical order and assign a consecutive number to each employee the employer shall exclude from the list employees who are known to regularly start work outside the six am am peak period b the employer shall determine the number of employees to be included in the random sample using the following formula where n is the sample size and n is the number of employees who start work between six am and ten am n   n1+o0026n1 a sample of size n based on this formula should produce an avr with a sampling error of at most plus or minus 005 with ninetyfive 95 percent probability the sample size based on this formula is displayed in the table below number of peak period employees at worksite sample size 400 to 420 200 421 to 440 205 441 to 460 210 461 to 480 214 481 to 500 218 501 to 550 225 551 to 600 235 601 to 650 240 651 to 700 248 701 to

in no case can the random sample size be less than indicated in the above table the employer may choose to include a larger number of employees in the survey a larger sample group should more accurately represent the entire employee population provided that the employer obtains a high response rate d after the sample size has been determined the employer shall use a random number list generated by the district to select the sample  1994   fees the fee schedule for rule 9001 is contained in rule 3130 trip reduction plan review fee  1994   alternative emission control at the option

is satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of  6 1994   variance procedurenature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 1 1994   variance procedureappeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration of the federal emergency management agency 2 1994   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with less existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in  to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense  create a nuisance see public safety or nuisance as defined in  cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of c and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 3 1994 title 16
