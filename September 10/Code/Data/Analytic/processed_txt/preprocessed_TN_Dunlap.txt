and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this  variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined herein upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 in passing upon such applications the municipal board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this  a the danger that materials may be swept onto other property to the injury of others  b the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion  c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage  d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e the necessity of the facility to a waterfront location in the case of a functionally dependent use  f the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use  g the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  h the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  i the expected

to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisance cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance as high as $25
