deposits intent a whereas the cost to the city in reviewing and processing applications and requests for various actions and approvals may differ greatly between different applications and requests can be significant especially when the city would incur additional and extraordinary outofpocket expenses eg for engineering planning legal andor other professional reviews above and beyond what is associated with the typical review of minor projects these costs and expenses cannot always be accurately predicted at the time an application or request is made  and b whereas the city council believes that it is reasonable and appropriate that the actual costs and expenses associated with reviewing such applications except for routine expenses should be properly borne by the applicant or requestor rather than by the taxpayers of the city  and c whereas the city council desires to set review fees for applications and requests for typical actions and approvals where the costs and expenses are more predictable and more easily estimated and to provide for procedures for requiring applicants and requestors to deposit amounts in escrow and guidelines for setting initial escrow deposit amounts where the action or approval is not typical and the costs and expenses of processing and reviewing it are not easily determined and may be extraordinary  and d whereas the city council intends that review fees and escrow deposit amounts be reasonably proportionate to the costs and expenses incurred by the city for the particular application or request and that such review fees and escrow amounts be used to defray the costs and expenses of processing and reviewing the application or request and of administering the review process and the citys ordinances and carrying out the citys business  and e whereas the city council intends to set forth requirements and guidelines for review fee escrow deposits and reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by the city from such escrow funds pt i 32816 requirements and guidelines a in addition to the other applicable zoning and review fees established and set by other city council resolutions when the city manager or his or her designee determines that an application or request for city approval or action will require reviews analysis input and other information from consultants engineers planners traffic engineers environmental consultants architects attorneys etc which have the potential to cause the city to incur unusual exceptional or extraordinary costs and expenses directly associated with the application or request the city manager or his or her designee may require that the applicant or requester deposit funds to establish an escrow account against which such costs and expenses will be charged b the city may require that an escrow deposit be established for all applications and requests for which the city will incur expenses as determined by the city manager or his or her designee c the city manager or his or her designee shall determine the amount of the initial review fee escrow deposit estimated to be sufficient to cover the expected costs and expenses likely to be incurred by the city as a result of the application or request the initial deposit shall not be less than $150000 factors for determining the initial escrow deposit amount shall include but not be limited to such variables as the size of the project the characteristics and complexity of the project the types of consultants needed to evaluate the application or request time constraints the need for specialized knowledge or expertise and other relevant factors if it is determined that a review fee escrow deposit is required no application or request shall be processed until the initial escrow deposit is submitted to the city and all other applicable fees are paid d at no time prior to the citys completion of its review and processing of the application or request shall the escrow balance be allowed to drop below $50000 if an escrow balance drops below $50000 the city manager or his or her designee shall notify the applicant or requestor of the need to deposit additional escrow funds and the specific amount to be deposited the applicant or requestor must deposit an additional amount as determined by the city manager or his or her designee to be reasonably necessary to cover the anticipated remaining andor future costs and expenses to be incurred by the city and to be paid from the escrow any additional required deposits must be deposited promptly to the city in order to continue processing the application or request all review and processing of the application or request including being placed on meeting agendas will be suspended until the additional escrow deposit is received by the city or an appeal of the matter has been decided in favor of the applicant or requestor e the city may draw funds from the applicants escrow deposit to reimburse the city for costs and expenses incurred by the city directly related to the review and processing of the application or to redistribute the funds to pay its consultants and agents upon verification of the costs and expenses incurred the city shall maintain records regarding escrow deposits and balances and shall authorize the disbursement of escrow funds in writing such escrow funds shall be accounted for separately any remaining or excess escrow funds will be refunded by the city to the applicant without interest if remaining or excess escrow funds are returned to the applicant or requestor by mail to

intended for use as  5827158274 for purposes of clarity and at the editors discretion these provisions have been included as  5825158254 purpose and findings the purpose of this division is to protect the public health safety and welfare of the property and persons in the city by prohibiting persons under 18 years of age from possessing tobacco products vapor products and alternative nicotine delivery products and prohibiting the sale and furnishing of tobacco products vapor products and alternative nicotine delivery products to persons under 18 years of age persons under age 18 are prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing cigarettes and other tobacco products and retailers are prohibited from selling them to minors there are new tobaccoless products however commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes ecigarettes ecigars ecigarillos epipes ehookahs or electronic nicotine delivery systems which allow the user to simulate cigarette smoking and ingest nicotine these products may be purchased by minors and are being marketed without age restrictions or health warnings and come in different flavors that appeal to young people ecigarettes and similar vapor and alternative nicotine delivery devices and products are a relatively new nicotine delivery system while devices vary in their appearance and specific method of operation they have a few basic elements in common a solution of water dissolved nicotine and other ingredients usually flavoring is heated with a heating element usually batterypowered this vaporizes the nicotine solution which passes into a mouthpiece and is inhaled in a manner similar to cigarette smoking often glycerol or propylene glycol is added to the solution to give the appearance of smoke when the solution is vaporized the concentration of nicotine contained in the solution can be customized by the retailer to the buyers specifications and many manufacturers make nicotinefree solutions the production and distribution of ecigarettes and vapor products is not currently regulated by federal or state authorities and the us food and drug administration has not completed testing of these products but initial studies by the fda have determined that ecigarettes can increase nicotine addiction among young people and contain chemical ingredients known to be harmful which may expose users and the public to potential health risks the use of ecigarettes vapor products and similar alternative nicotine delivery products has increased significantly in recent years as evidenced by the fact that between 2011 and 2012 the percentage of all youth in grades 6 to 12 who had tried electronic smoking devices doubled   68% of all youth in grades 6 and 12 report trying electronic smoking devices   10% of high school students have tried electronic smoking devices   93% of youth who have used electronic smoking devices have never smoked conventional cigarettes  and  between 2010 and 201 rates of both awareness and use of unregulated electronic smoking devices by adults also increased significantly existing studies on electronic smoking devices vapor emissions and cartridge contents have found a number of dangerous substances including  chemicals known to cause cancer such as formaldehyde acetaldehyde lead nickel and chromium   pm25 acrolein tin toluene and aluminum which are associated with a range of negative health effects such as skin eye and respiratory irritation neurological effects damage to reproductive systems and even premature death from heart attacks and stroke   inconsistent labeling of nicotine levels in electronic smoking device products  and  in one instance diethylene glycol an ingredient used in antifreeze and toxic to humans several studies have concluded that exposure to vapor from electronic smoking devices may cause passive or secondhand vaping some cartridges used by electronic smoking devices can be refilled with liquid nicotine solution creating the potential for exposure to dangerous concentrations of nicotine and as a result  in one instance diethylene glycol an ingredient used in antifreeze and toxic to humans   poisonings from electronic smoking devices have increased dramatically in the last three and onehalf 312 years from one 1 a month in september 2010 to two hundred fifteen 215 a month in february 2014   analysis of reports of poisonings from electronic smoking devices finds that calls reporting exposure to electronic smoking devices are much more likely to involve adverse health effects when compared to calls reporting exposure to conventional cigarettes clinical studies about the safety and efficacy of these products have not been submitted to the fda for the over four hundred 400 brands of electronic smoking devices that are on the market and for this reason consumers currently have no way of knowing  whether electronic smoking devices are safe   what types or concentrations of potentially harmful chemicals the products contain  and  what dose of nicotine the products deliver the world health organization has strongly advised consumers against the use of electronic smoking devices until they are deemed safe and effective and of acceptable quality by a competent national regulatory body the world medical association has determined that electronic smoking devices are not comparable to scientificallyproven methods of smoking cessation and that neither their value as therapeutic aids for smoking cessation nor their safety as cigarette replacements is established a study published in the journal of environmental and public health suggests that electronic smoking devices may have the capacity to renormalize tobacco use in a demographic that has had significant denormalization of tobacco use previously electronic smoking devices often mimic conventional tobacco products in shape size and color with the user exhaling a smokelike vapor similar in appearance to the exhaled smoke from cigarettes and other conventional tobacco products the use of electronic smoking devices in smokefree locations threatens to undermine compliance with smoking regulations and reverse the progress that has been made in establishing a social norm that smoking is not permitted in public places and places of employment in september of 201 forty 40 state attorneys general including michigans signed a letter to the commissioner of the united states food and drug administration outlining their concerns with ecigarettes and requesting the implementation of regulations that would address the advertising ingredients and sale to minors of ecigarettes at the federal level it is the intent of the city council in enacting the ordinance codified in this division to provide for the public health safety and welfare by facilitating uniform and consistent enforcement of smokefree air laws  by reducing the potential for renormalizing smoking in public places and places of employment  by reducing the potential for children to associate the use of electronic smoking devices with a normative or healthy lifestyle  and by prohibiting the sale or distribution of electronic smoking devices vapor products and alternative nicotine delivery products to minors therefore the south lyon city council determines that prohibiting the sale giving or furnishing of ecigarettes and vapor products to minors and prohibiting the purchase possession or use of ecigarettes and vapor products by minors is in the citys best interests and will promote public health safety and welfare for purposes of this division the city is adopting the terms vapor product and alternative nicotine delivery product to address ecigarettes and all similar devices because these terms has been defined by the michigan

course e construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of motorists or otherwise endanger the health or safety of passersby f variance from certain sign regulations would be offset by

editors note adopted  repealed the former  102459 and enacted a new  102459 as set out herein the former  102459 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from 2   one family cluster housing option a generally the intent of this section is to permit the development of onefamily residential patterns which innovation will introduce development flexibility so as to provide for the sound physical development of sites in those instances where the normal subdivision platting process or single family site condominium procedure or development under the open space preservation option as set forth and regulated in this ordinance would otherwise be unreasonably restrictive to accomplish this the following modifications to the conventional one family residential standards of this ordinance be permitted provided the qualifying conditions set forth in this section and the standards applicable to the clustering of dwelling units are met b qualifying conditions in all one family residential districts one family clustering may be permitted in approving areas for one family cluster development under this section the planning commission shall find that at least one of the following conditions or characteristics exists on the property 1 an area generally parallel to and generally not to exceed 360 feet in depth on those unsubdivided parcels of land having frontage on a major thoroughfare as depicted on the citys master plan map and having a rightofway width of 120 feet and being so located as to provide transition between nonresidential or major thoroughfares and onefamily development 2 an unsubdivided area which the planning commission finds to be of such unusual shape or which is found to contain unsuitable or generally nonbuildable soil conditions or which has unusually severe topographic conditions or which is characterized by some other unusual physical or development factor which would make sound physical development under the normal subdivision or single family site condominium approach impractical 3 an unsubdivided area which the planning commission finds to be characterized by major stands of trees streams or other water courses including wetlands which as significant natural assets ought to be preserved such conditions making sound development of the property under the normal subdivision or single family site condominium approach undesirable 4 the natural landforms are so arranged that the change of elevation within the site includes slopes in excess of 15 percent between these elevations these elevation changes and slopes shall appear as the typical feature of the site rather than exceptional or infrequent features of the site 5 the achieving of road grades of less than six percent is impossible unless the site were mass graded providing clusters of one family dwellings will in the opinion of the planning commission allow for greater preservation of the sites natural setting c dwelling density the maximum number of dwellings that may be permitted on the property shall be computed in the following manner 1 the dwelling density of sites containing five or fewer acres excluding any existing public road rightsofway shall not exceed the number of dwellings per acre set forth herein by zoning district 2 sites containing more than five acres shall not exceed the total number of homes that could be built on the property were it to develop as a conventional subdivision plat or not to exceed the total number of dwellings per acre set forth herein by zoning district whichever results in the fewer number of dwellings 3 the overall dwelling density permitted on those parcels of land containing five or fewer acres and which qualify for development under the one family cluster housing option and in which there will be no public street rightsofway the total number of dwellings per acre by zoning district shall not exceed the following dwelling density rations if any interior streets will be in public rightsofway the dwelling density limitations set forth herein for sites over five acres shall apply zoning district dwellings per acre r1a 22 r1 27 r2 33 r3 37 the overall dwelling density permitted on those parcels of land containing more than five acres and which qualify for development under the one family cluster housing option and all streets will be in pubic rightsofway shall not exceed the following number of dwelling density rations by zoning district unless development of the site as a conventional subdivision plat were to result in fewer dwellings per acre were to result in fewer dwellings per acre as stipulated in subsection c2 above zoning district dwellings per acre r1a 29 r1 36 r2 44 r3 50 d dwelling building configurations under this section the attaching of one family homes in clusters and the detaching of one family homes in clusters shall be in accordance with the following applicable guidelines 1 the attaching of one family homes in clusters shall be permitted when said homes are attached one to another either common party wall or garage wall which does not have more than 50 percent of an individual wall or more than 25 percent of the total exterior walls of a home in common with the wall or walls of an adjoining home or by means of an architectural detail which does not form interior room space or common party wall in only the garage portion of the adjacent structures there being no common party wall relationship permitted other portion of an residential dwelling unit 2 the detaching of one family homes in clusters shall be permitted so long as each home is separated from any other home in the cluster by a distance of six feet if the opposing walls of the home have no openings and a distance of ten feet if either or both opposing walls of two dwellings in a cluster have openings no detached garage shall be located closer than ten feet from any dwelling unit 3 the maximum number of homes in a cluster shall be subject to review by the planning commission except in no event shall a cluster contain more than four homes 4 structures including garages shall be located no closer to a street rightofway or service drive than 25 feet except the exterior side wall of an end unit in a cluster may be located 15 feet from an interior street rightofway or service drive when that wall does not have a garage or pedestrian door 5 except as otherwise set forth herein each cluster of one family attached or detached homes shall be separated from any other cluster of attached or detached one family homes by a distance determined by the number of homes in opposing clusters as set forth in the following scale total number of homes in a cluster 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 minimum distance in feet 50 45 40 35 30 25 20 the planning commission may vary the above minimum separation standards in only those instances where compliance with the strict application of the above standards would result in the loss of or partial loss of a site amenity of particular value such as a landmark tree or a wetland area or a steep topographic condition in no event shall the reduction in any distance between clusters result in any increase in the number of dwelling units permitted on the property beyond the maximum number of dwellings permitted as set forth in subsection c of this section 6 all clusters of one family dwellings that abut a designated major thoroughfare shall have a rear yard or side yard relationship to the thoroughfare 7 a landscaped earth berm at least five feet high shall be provided along the entire property line abutting any
