sign regulations purpose of sign regulations the public has a legitimate interest and concern in the construction maintenance and regulation of outdoor advertising within the city while rainbow city acknowledges the legitimate public need for business visibility local businesses must also recognize the legitimate public need for a beautiful and uncluttered community and the citys legitimate need to ensure safe traffic circulation on city streets local experience within rainbow city gadsden atlanta and birmingham generally supports the contention that excessive competing signage along public streets can create visual clutter which makes it difficult for motorists to see traffic control and highway safety signs and to know where entrances to adjoining businesses are located the city also has determined that excessive competing signage can divert motorist attention from the highway which contributes to traffic accidents therefore rainbow city has determined that it is desirable to prescribe the manner of sign construction and to compel the use of safe materials  limit the number type surface area height and location of signs  and require clean and sanitary maintenance of signs in order to protect and promote the public health safety and welfare of the community further these sign regulations are intended to lessen hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic  preserve

concern in the placement and appearance of telecommunication towers antennas and satellite dishes under the telecommunications act of 199 where such control does not conflict with or unreasonably constrain the legitimate right of businesses to exercise free trade rainbow city desires access to advanced technology to serve its businesses and citizens but not at the expense of the communitys overall appearance and public image rainbow city seeks to impose sensible controls on telecommunication facilities in order to maintain the aesthetic character and charm of the community and its neighborhoods against the insensitive and uncontrolled proliferation and placement of wireless facilities new telecommunications towers should not create a cluttered landscape or dominate the communitys skyline as it is viewed from the primary highway entrances to rainbow city to that end the city desires to partner with telecommunications firms to ensure expansion of the existing telecommunications infrastructure that will provide effective advanced communications services throughout the city and surrounding environs commensurate with local needs with a minimal visual impact

the electronic industries association any amendments thereto or replacements thereof as may be adopted by the city council the citys building inspector or hisher designee shall determine whether a proposed communication facility will comply with this requirement d appearance and view protection all proposed communication facilities with the exception of proposed antennas that will be colocated on a preexisting tower shall be attractively camouflaged disguised or hidden in a manner that it will blend into the surrounding environment to the greatest extent possible examples of proper camouflaging include designing a tower to resemble a tree designing a monopole to look like and function as a flag pole or freestanding sign support hiding an antenna within a church steeple or any other effective means of disguising the appearance of a tower or antenna that may be appropriate for the setting in the area surrounding the proposed communication facility site it shall be the burden of the applicant to document and prove that a proposed communication facility cannot be effectively camouflaged before approval of a noncamouflaged structure may be permitted by the city in such instances the applicant shall explore alternative means of minimizing the visual impact of the antenna such as installing it onto an existing telephone pole streetlight or building rooftop rather than erecting a new tower specifically for the proposed antenna however in no instance shall a noncamouflaged communication facility be approved for a residential property e signs prohibited no signs or other forms of advertising including signs displaying the name of the owner or user of the tower or antenna may be attached to or depicted on a communication facility unless the proposed facility is a new monopole specifically camouflaged and approved to serve as a permitted freestanding sign support this prohibition shall not apply to any required warning or private property posting signs f construction materials where applicable building codes technical codes and federal regulations permit flexibility in the choice of construction materials and where the selection of alternative

interference with existing communication facilities serving the area i siting requirements for whip antennas whip antennas shall not be allowed on a wall mounted antenna structure j colocation no new tower or monopole shall be erected on a proposed communication facility site unless the applicant can document and prove that an existing colocation site is not available or is not technically capable of serving the specific telecommunication need in the area of the proposed site this colocation requirement may be waived by the city where the proposed antenna would create an excessively cluttered appearance on the available colocation site thereby drawing greater visual attention to the existing antenna site or creating a more imposing obstruction to scenic views and vistas from the area and the proposed new antenna would be less visible or intrusive on the surrounding area if effectively camouflaged on an alternate site k setback requirements all proposed communication facilities and structures including guys and accessory facilities shall satisfy the minimum setback requirements of the zoning district in which they will be sited however all proposed tower compounds that will be located on a residential property shall be subject to an additional setback from all property boundaries of the site equal to the height of the tower structure as measured from the finished ground
