amended   o0535 enacted  appeal and variance procedures nature of variances 1762 floodplain board 1763 appeals and request for variance considerations 1764 conditions for variances nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this article are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the town of oro valley to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the base flood elevation are so serious as much as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage that variances from the base flood elevation shall not be granted variances from other requirements in the floodplain management ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate additionally ars 483609j states that the land for which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided for by title 26 a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the pima county recorder and shall be recorded

habitats may be generally characterized or distinguished into three 3 classes hydroriparian mesoriparian and xeroriparian by a difference in plant species composition or an increase in the size andor density of vegetation as compared to upland areas as follows a hydroriparian habitats riparian habitats generally associated with perennial water courses with plant communities dominated by obligate or preferential wetland plant species such as willow and cottonwood b mesoriparian habitats riparian habitats generally associated with perennial or intermittent flows or shallow ground water with plant communities dominated by species that may also be found in drier habitats but contain some preferential riparian plant species such as ash or netleaf hackberry the mesquite bosque and sycamoreash association are examples of this community type c xeroriparian habitats xeroriparian habitats are supported by intermittent or ephemeral stream flows typical species associated with this habitat type include mesquite blue palo verde desert willow catclaw acacia whitehorn acacia desert hackberry and ironwood actual species composition is typically a function of the extent and frequency of stream flow xeroriparian habitats are present along washes throughout the town of oro valley for the purposes of this classification system xeroriparian habitats are further divided into the following subcategories 1high xeroriparian a habitats generally associated with welldeveloped water courses the trees present are generally sixteen 16 feet to twenty 20 feet tall or taller the vegetative volume per unit area within this habitat type is approximately  m3m2 with much of the volume present within the dense overstory the diversity of species is relatively greater than that associated with intermediate xeroriparian b and low riparian c habitat types mesquite desert willow blue palo verde and desert hackberry are representative tree species within high xeroriparian a habitat areas 2intermediate xeroriparian b habitats typically occur along welldeveloped water courses the principal distinction between xeroriparian a and xeroriparian b habitats is that of plant size height trunk size and total vegetative volume trees in this habitat type generally range from six 6 feet to fifteen 15 feet tall the understory is often more extensive than xeroriparian a habitats due to a more open overstory canopy within intermediate xeroriparian b habitats the vegetative volume per unit area is typically  m3m2 mesquite ironwood blue palo verde catclaw acacia desert broom and desert hackberry are representative of this habitat type 3low xeroriparian c habitats typically occur along minor watercourses and along the peripheral edges of major watercourses the typical vegetative volume per unit area in this habitat type is between  and  m3m2 whitethorn acacia catclaw acacia desert creosote bush bunchgrasses and bursage are typically found within low xeroriparian c habitats 4regional drainageway not a single habitat type but rather an aggregation of the habitat types described above distributed continuously along a regional drainage way the regional drainageway

areas of sparsely vegetated or nonvegetated wash bottom all of which is within the undeveloped floodplain the high habitat value associated with regional drainageways stems from their length which can be uninterrupted for lengths of several miles their width which provides habitat areas that are relatively isolated from adjacent urban developments and their configuration which provides connections

drainage without perennial surface water but any of the following species arizona walnut juglans major fremont cottonwood populus fremontii gooding willow salix gooddingii arizona sycamore platanus wrightii arizona ash fraxinus velutina netleaf hackberry celtis reticulata or seep willow baccharis salicifolia  xeroriparian includes any drainage with intermittentephemeral flow but not containing the above indicator species  xeroriparian areas will have a representative vegetation volume of  m3m2 or greater bthe lateral riparian boundary is a contiguous line along the canopy margins of the predominant overstory vegetation species parallel to a riparian area where the lateral distance between canopy margins of individuals of the predominant plant species is less than two times the height of the tallest individuals where the distance between canopy margins parallel to the channel are greater than two times the height of the tallest individuals the boundary is considered to be the top of bank of the channel cboundary between meso and xeroriparian habitat types  any gap between mesoriparian indicator species of 1000 feet  or greater will indicate a transition to xeroriparian mesoriparian boundary will be at indicator species canopy din braided riparian systems where islands may occur these are included as part of the riparian area islands more than 200 feet wide or whose surface elevation is significantly higher than surrounding channels are not included ebecause of natural variability not all areas within mapped riparian areas will support the overall representative vegetation volume additionally mapped riparian areas may include areas without representative vegetation volume but do contribute to regional riparian system functions eg drainage connectivity sediment and nutrient transport channel meander etc friparian areas disconnected hydrologically from downstream riparian areas by human disturbance or impacts are not included gthe criteria for determining an upstream starting point headwaters of riparian areas with representative vegetation volume is where a discernible channel with an ordinary high water mark begins hvegetation volume

environmentally sensitive lands 1911 formerly codified in  aintroduction this ordinance seeks to implement the adopted planning goals of this community with regard to public safety conservation of resources community design and open space and recreation oro valley is surrounded by mountains these mountainous areas exhibit steep slopes which may contain unstable rock and soils development on potentially unstable soils or rock can be hazardous to life and property development in these areas should utilize construction methods which ensure slope stabilization and minimize soil erosion further oro valleys rolling desert terrain containing peaks ridges and drainageways is a valuable scenic resource which should be preserved significant peaks and ridges should be protected in order to preserve the towns unique visual setting promote its economic wellbeing and encourage tourism regulating the intensity of development according to the natural characteristics of hillside terrain such as steepness of slope significant vegetation and landforms and soil stability and existing drainage patterns will allow for sensible development in hillside areas while minimizing the physical and visual impact of such development bpurpose this zone provides for the reasonable use of hillside areas and related lands while protecting the public health safety and general welfare by 1 determining whether certain types of soil conditions exist such as loose or easily eroded soils or rocky soils and utilizing appropriate engineering technology to result in stable slopes during and subsequent to development 2 reduction of water runoff and changes in the natural drainage patterns soil erosion and rock slides by minimizing grading and requiring revegetation 3 permitting intensity of development compatible with the natural characteristics of hillside terrain such as steepness of slope significant landforms soil suitability and existing drainage patterns 4 preservation of the scenic quality of the desert and mountain environment retention of significant peaks and ridges in their natural state 5 reduction of the physical impact of hillside development by encouraging innovative site and

225 m2400 m2 or 2422 ft2 4306 ft2 c rectangular plots 15 meters x 20 meters 300 m2 or 3229 ft2 3transect sampling transects may be conducted according to the point intercept and belt transect methods the method is based on a 50meter point transect centered on a 250meter plot ie the belt transect using this method vegetation is sampled by points at 05meter intervals along the 50meter transect to determine cover the surveyor will note the species encountered at each interval in addition individuals of each perennial species rooted within the 250meter plot will be counted to determine density and diversity all annuals present in the 250meter plot will also be noted 4plant material quality a plant materials may consist of salvaged plants or cuttings as well as container plants grown in traditional or tall pots from seed collected locally specifically for the project container plants will be grown at a nursery that specializes in producing highquality native plant species for habitat restoration projects b native soil shall be used in the plant containers if possible if more native soil is needed than is available to fill plant containers each container shall receive some native soil mixed with an appropriate commercial nursery soil mix c container plants must be grown outdoors and in full sunlight prior to container plants being delivered to the project site they shall be hardened off from water so they may be able to sustain themselves under potential drought conditions once planted d deepplanting techniques for woody species are permitted in order to achieve maximum survival with minimal irrigation this may include deepplanting of dormant pole cuttings as well as the use of container stock grown in tall pots all plant materials shall be inspected by town staff prior to installation to ensure they are healthy disease free and of proper species quantities and sizes  this website is for demonstration or proofing purposes only it is not necessarily endorsed by
