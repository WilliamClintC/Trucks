and intent a authority the united states supreme court has ruled that sexuallyexplicit speech including nude dancing is entitled to some level of protection under the first amendment to the united states constitution as a result municipalities may not ban adult establishments however the supreme court has ruled that cities may adopt contentneutral zoning and licensing provisions to regulate and control the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments on the community b findings of the city council the minnesota attorney generals office and the cities of st paul alexandria and rochester minnesota as well as st croix county wisconsin have conducted studies of the impact of adult establishments on their respective communities these studies have concluded that adult establishments have an adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhoods those impacts include increased crime rates lower property values increased transiency neighborhood blight and potential health risks the city council of the city of hastings is relying on the studies many of which were conducted in larger cities recognizing that the same or similar adverse impacts could occur in a smaller city such as the city of hastings the findings are based on the experiences of other cities where such businesses have located based on these studies the city council makes the following findings regarding the need to regulate adult establishments 1 adult establishments have adverse secondary impacts of the types set forth above 2 the adverse impacts caused by adult establishments tend to diminish if adult establishments are governed by location and licensing requirements 3 the city may adopt regulations to promote the public health safety morals and general welfare 4 the public health safety morals and general welfare will be promoted by regulations governing adult establishments 5 adult establishments can contribute to increased criminal activity and police calls in the area in which they are located taxing law enforcement services 6 adult establishments can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity the experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and operation of such businesses can however minimize this risk 7 adult establishments can cause or contribute to public health problems by the presence of live adult entertainment in conjunction with food andor drink on the same premises 8 many members of the public perceive areas within which adult establishments are located as less safe than other areas that do not have such uses 66 9 the adverse impact that adult establishments have on the surrounding area diminishes as the distance from the adult establishments increases 10 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of reasonable regulation on the owners operators employees and performers of the adult establishment a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the adult establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexuallyoriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 11 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexuallyrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this 12 the barring of individuals with sexuallyrelated criminal convictions from the management and operation of adult establishments for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which may lead to the transmission of sexuallytransmitted diseases 13 the general health safety and welfare of the community is promoted by prohibiting nudity in adult establishments this prohibition is based on concerns of potential adverse effects such as prostitution the transmission of sexuallytransmitted diseases exposure to minors obscenity and unsanitary conditions in public areas 14 small cities experience many of the same adverse impacts of adult establishments present in larger communities c purpose it is the purpose of this regulate adult establishments to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to 1 prevent criminal activity within the city  2 allow for efficient and effective law enforcement services in the city  3 prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequences adverse effect on real estate values of properties within the neighborhood  4 locate adult establishments away from residential areas schools parks and places of worship  5 provide a contentneutral objective licensing scheme that allows the city to monitor adult establishments for violations of building and health codes  and 6 prevent ownership of adult establishments by persons with prior relevant criminal convictions 67 d reasonable opportunity the provisions of this not prohibit adult establishments from having a reasonable opportunity to locate in the city this not for the purpose of nor is it intended to impose a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including adultoriented materials similarly it is neither the intent nor effect of this restrict or deny access by adults to adultoriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by distributors or exhibitors of adultoriented entertainment to their intended market rd series passed 9152008  11421 definitions for the purposes of this terms defined in this section have the meanings given them adult
