stormwater management system which is adequate to serve the area and which meets the requirements of this chapter the stormwater management design manual and other criteria of the city there are two classifications of stormwater management systems which must exist athe initial or minor drainage system shall provide for the collecting and transporting of runoff water from frequently occurring storms such system includes watercourses streets curbs gutters underground storm sewers manholes catch basins and culverts this systems purpose is to lessen or eliminate inconveniences and safety and health hazards associated with frequent storms except where indicated otherwise design criteria and requirements of this chapter are directed to the minor drainage system bmajor drainage system features shall ensure that stormwater runoff which exceeds the capacity of the minor drainage system has a route to follow that will not cause any loss of property or any loss of life it must be recognized that the major drainage system exists even when it is not planned and whether or not physical facilities are intelligently located in respect to it bclassification of drainagewayswaterways the following classifications shall be applied for drainagewayswaterways in determining design and operational capacity 1major drainageways are defined as those with a tributary area in excess of 351 acres such major drainageways shall be designed so that no structural damage shall occur when the average recurrence interval of 100 years is used for hydraulic analysis of the drainageways storm detention channel construction or other improvements may be necessary to pass the 100year design storm downstream sections of the drainageway 2secondary waterways are defined as those with a tributary area between 100 and 350 acres such secondary waterways shall be designed so that no structural damage shall occur when the average recurrence interval of fifty years is used for hydraulic analysis of the drainageways storm detention channel construction or other improvements may be necessary to pass the fifty year design storm downstream sections of the drainageway 3minor waterways are defined as those with ninetynine acres or less of tributary area such minor drainageways shall be designed so that no structural damage shall occur when the average recurrence interval of twenty five years is used for hydraulic analysis of the drainageways storm detention channel construction or other improvements may be necessary to pass the twentyfive year design storm downstream sections of the drainageway in addition to or in lieu of the above noted standards the city engineer may utilize a water surface profile program such as hec2 hydraulic engineering center software program us army corps of engineers to determine the appropriate size of system components and to provide the maximum amount of cost benefit for each area cstormwater runoff 1land uses which increase the runoff rate or volume shall be required to control the discharge rate of runoff prior to its release to off site land the purposes of this policy are to apermit development without increasing the flooding of other lands breduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their capacity which may be caused by increases in quantity and rate of water discharged cestablish a basis for design of a storm drainage system on lands below undeveloped areas which will preserve the rights of property owners and assure the longterm adequacy of storm drainage systems 2developers are required to design improvements such that after development the rate of stormwater runoff leaving the project area at strategic points is no more than if the project area had remained undeveloped if necessary detentionretention facilities shall be constructed to assure that this requirement is met 3where a portion of the project area contains existing development features such as buildings streets parking lots sidewalks driveways etc and a permit application is made for additional development the area to be considered in determining the rate of stormwater runoff shall be only that on which the additional development is sought 4the city engineer may reduce or waive requirements for an individual detentionretention basin if a common or regional basin of adequate design is available or if the stormwater management utility is reasonably certain that one will be constructed and if the major drainage system from the project area to such common or regional basin is such that the public health safety and welfare will not be in jeopardy 5stormwater management systems will be designed for the ultimate use of the land and shall be capable of conveying runoff originating upstream as determined by the city engineer dacquisition of easements for public facilities on private property in those case where components of a stormwater management system designed to be operated as a public facility lie outside the public right of way easements of sufficient size as determined by the city engineer shall be acquired from the owner of the property to assure access and maintenance edetentionretention basins 1detentionretention basins serve to capture and temporarily or on a longterm basis store the surface water runoff which results from urban development this storage allows for the release of the stormwater runoff at discharge rates which are acceptable to the receiving waterway 2onsite provisions of detentionretention storage shall conform to the following standards athe release rate and volume of storage shall be based on the 100 year storm interval design for post development conditions and be released at a fiveyear storm interval rate for predevelopment conditions  brecreational use should be maximized where possible and feasible passed 31494 91915principles for minimizing erosion and sedimentation  standards for preparation of plans  contents of plans athe following principles are effective in minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in plans 1stripping of vegetation regrading or other development shall be done in such a way that will minimize erosion whenever feasible natural vegetation shall be retained protected and supplemented  2development plans shall preserve salient natural features keep grading operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with topography so as to create the least erosion potential  3the smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one time and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum the topsoil shall be preserved and returned to the surface of areas to be re vegetated new topsoil will be provided or the surface shall be covered with sod  4disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practical with temporary vegetation or mulching to protect exposed critical areas during development  5the permanent vegetation and structural erosion control and drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development  6provision shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased stormwater runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development where necessary detentionretention basins shall be provided according to the requirements of this chapter and the stormwater management design

shall only be permitted in swales or watercourses  4the installation of the specific stormwater management measures shall be accomplished in accordance with the standards and specifications contained

frontage of 50 feet  2located to serve as buffer between incompatible uses  3along stream corridors but outside the 100year floodplain to ensure that filling the floodplain wont be necessary to provide recreational facilities  4within wooded areas provided sufficient vacant ground exists for recreational facilities without disturbing woods  5within severe sloped areas and ravines provided sufficient level ground exists for recreational facilities without requiring significant grading 1where the developer cannot satisfactorily show the specific number of dwelling units to be built the following presumptions will apply awhere the property to be developed is zoned r1 the presumption is that one dwelling unit per lot will be constructed  bwhere the property to be developed is zoned r2 the presumption is that two dwelling units per lot will be constructed  cwhere the property to be developed is zoned r3 the presumption is that 2178 dwelling units per acre will be constructed  2the

accepted land dedication z   remaining land for which a fee is required example for a 100 acre development for which three acres of parkland or one hundred fifty thousand dollars $150000 is required only one acre of parkland is accepted  two acres require a fee 3 acres required  l acre accepted   2 acres for fee $50000 x 2 acres   $100000 fee required 4all fees shall be computed at preliminary
