15851594 was at the discretion of the editor although it is not standard practice to include whereas clauses of an ordinance in the it is the editors opinion that the whereas clauses found in contain material relevant to the subject matter of this division and also provide a comprehensive view of the intent and purpose of said ordinance therefore the whereas clauses contained in read as follows whereas the city council of the city of defuniak springs florida the council is aware that local government may by virtue of the twentyfirst 21st amendment to the united statutes constitution regulate and prohibit various forms of actual and simulated nude and sexual conduct and the depiction thereof within and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages see california v larue 409 us 109 93 sct 390 rehearing denies 410 us 948 93 sct 1351 1972  and new york state liquor authority v bellanca 452 us 714 101 sct 2599 1981  and whereas the council is aware that local government may prohibit the exposure of certain body parts in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages see geaneas v willets 911 f2d 579 11th cir 1990  and whereas the council wishes to regulate nudity and sexual conduct in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages  and the council is aware of evidence from other communities that indicates that nudity and sexual conduct coupled with alcohol in public places begets undesirable behavior and that prostitution attempted rape rape and assault have occurred and have the potential for occurring in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages where nude and sexual conduct is permitted  and whereas the council wishes to protect against similar conditions to the end that they not occur in defuniak springs florida at or around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages  and whereas the council desires to prohibit the public display of nude conduct and sexual behavior or the simulation thereof in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages  and whereas the council finds and determines that there are increasing incidents of nudity in public places other than establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages and in other places readily visible to the public  and whereas the council finds and determines that persons who choose to appear nude in public places are engaging in conduct which often serves to impose their nudity on others who did not seek it out who are not able to reasonably avoid observing it and who may be offended or distressed thereby  and whereas appearing nude in public places was a criminal offense at common law and was considered an act malum en se  and whereas the council desires to protect and preserve the unique character of defuniak springs florida as a family oriented historic attraction for families tourists and businesses  and whereas the council finds and determines that appearing nude in public places is still contrary to the general societal disapproval that the people of defuniak springs florida have of persons appearing nude among strangers in public places  and whereas the council finds and determines that the mere appearance of persons in the nude in public places generally increases incidents of prostitution sexual assaults and batteries attracts other criminal activity to the community and encourages degradation of women and other activities which break down family structures  and whereas the council finds and determines that without regulation public nudity constitutes harmful conduct and occurs in a manner which is incompatible with the normal primary activity of a particular place at a particular time  and whereas the councils sole intent in enacting this ordinance is to prohibit the conduct of being nude in public places and to suppress the adverse secondary effects such nudity generates the council nevertheless recognizes that there may be instances wherein appearing nude in a public place may be expressive conduct incidental to and a necessary part of the freedom of expression that is protected by united states or florida constitutional provisions  and whereas a requirement that dancers don opaque coverings sufficient to cover the buttocks and the breasts as such portions of the human anatomy are defined in this ordinance does not deprive the dance of whatever erotic message if any it may convey but simply makes such message if any slightly less graphic and imposes only an incidental limitation on the message  and whereas it is the intent of the council to protect and preserve the public health safety welfare and morals of defuniak springs florida by restricting to the full extent allowed by the united states and florida constitutions the act of being nude to places which are not frequented by the public and places which are not readily visible to the public  and whereas defuniak springs florida is essentially a ruralsuburban community which has a population of less than 10000 people  and whereas defuniak springs florida is a city that is and desires very much to continue to be a community that contains and is known for traditional wholesale public recreations activities and historic facilities such as the historic district of defuniak springs and the florida chautauqua  and whereas the council finds and determines that the average person applying contemporary defuniak springs community standards would find that the public nudity prohibited by this ordinance if allowed when taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest and lacks serious literary artistic political and scientific value  and whereas non regulation of persons appearing nude in public places within defuniak springs encourages commercial entities and other entities and persons to advertise outside of defuniak springs and the state of florida by billboard radio print and other media the availability of nudity in public places within defuniak springs and thus encourages the influx into defuniak springs of persons seeking to observe andor participate in such nudity and to participate in the disorderly harmful and illegal conduct that is associated therewith thereby increasing injuries and damages to the citizens of this city who will be victims of such increased disorderly harmful and unlawful conduct  and whereas competitive commercial advertising andor exploitation of nudity encourages escalation of nude and lewd conduct within the competing commercial establishments exploiting such conduct and thereby increases the adverse effects upon public order and public health  and whereas the council finds and determines that the prohibitions contained herein are the most reasonable and minimal restrictions required so as to regulate conduct which is adverse to public order health morality and decency within defuniak springs when such conduct takes place at locations where the public is present or is likely to be present or where such conduct would be readily visible to the public  and whereas the passage of this ordinance is necessary to preserve the basic character of the city of defuniak springs florida  and whereas the council is aware that states may regulate the conduct of appearing nude in public places see michael barnes v glen theatre inc 115 l ed 2d 504 111 sct 2456 1991  and whereas the council is not hereby prohibiting nudity in truly private places or prohibiting nudity which is protected by united states or florida constitutional provisions  and whereas the council finds and determines that the express exemption contained in bii of this ordinance section 15912ii of this  provides adequate protection to persons who without such express exemption might otherwise be prevented or discouraged by the ordinance from exercising constitutionally protected rights  and whereas although the council is of the opinion that this ordinance is a general ordinance regulating conduct and is not an ordinance that affects the use of land as contemplated by florida statute 12566 the council does not wish to become sidetracked in lengthy and expensive litigation concerning procedural matters that are not relevant to the subject matter of this ordinance and has determined to enact this ordinance under the more conservative expensive and time consuming affecting use of land procedure as well as under the general procedure for ordinances that regulate conduct  and whereas the council finds and determines that this ordinance is consistent with its current comprehensive plan  cross reference comprehensive plan  182 et seq  zoning app a title this division shall be known as the defuniak springs public nudity  11493 intent it is the intent of this division to protect and preserve the health safety welfare and morals of the citizens of defuniak springs by prohibiting a person from intentionally or recklessly appearing or being nude or causing another person to appear to be nude in a public place and in

conveyance or communication of a genuine message or public expression and is not a guise or pretense utilized to exploit nudity for profit or commercial gain see for instance board of county commissioners v dexterhouse 348 so 2d 916 fla 2nd dca 1977 and as such is protected by the united states or florida constitution or ii because it is otherwise protected by the united states or florida

found that an obstruction to navigable airspace has the potential for endangering the lives and property of users of the defuniak springs airport and property or occupants of land in its vicinity  that an obstruction may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums of the defuniak springs airport  and that an obstruction may reduce the size of areas available for the landing take off and maneuvering of aircraft thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the defuniak springs airport and the public investment therein accordingly it is declared that 1 the creation establishment or maintenance of an obstruction and the incompatible use of land in the airport vicinity are public nuisances and injure the community served by the defuniak springs airport  2 it is necessary in the interest of the public health public safety and general welfare that the creation establishment or maintenance of obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented  3 the prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished to the extent legally possible by the exercise of the police power without compensation  4 the establishment of noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport have the potential of limiting the existing and future utility of the airport and may adversely affect the region served by the defuniak springs airport  5 land in the vicinity of the airport has the potential of being exposed to sound levels of 65 dnl and higher 6 that the construction of certain noise sensitive developments in the vicinity of the airport should include outdoortoindoor noise attenuation features so as not to be incompatible with existing and future noise levels 7 promoting land uses compatible with the existing and future operations of the airport serve to protect the public investment in the airport and promote a more livable community in the vicinity of the airport  and 8 the defuniak springs airport fulfills an essential community purpose it is further declared that the limitation of land uses incompatible with normal airport operations the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination removal alteration mitigation or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property interests therein or air rights thereover c purpose and applicability 1 purposes the purpose of these regulations is to promote the health safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the region by preventing the creation establishment or maintenance of hazards to aircraft  preventing the destruction or impairment of the utility of the defuniak springs airport and the public investments therein

essential to air navigation or the movement of aircraft 2 nonprecision instrument approach zones a nonprecision instrument approach zones is established for each end of the runway the inner edge of the nonprecision approach zone coincides with the width of the primary zone and is five hundred 500 feet wide the approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of four thousand 4000 feet at the horizontal distance of ten thousand 10000 feet from the primary zone its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway 3 transitional zones the transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces adjoining the primary zone and the nonprecision instrument approach zones 4 horizontal zones the horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of ten thousand 10000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary zone and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs the horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones 5 conical zone the conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward a horizontal distance of four thousand 4000 feet e airport zone height limitations except as otherwise provided in this article no structure shall be erected altered or maintained and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this article to a height exceeding the elevation of any corresponding approach transitional horizontal or conical surface or to a height that would adversely affect approach minimums eg decision heights or visibility minimums published for the airport applicable heights of the approach transitional horizontal or conical surfaces at various distances from the primary zone are established as follows 1 nonprecision instrument approach zone the nonprecision instrument approach surface slopes thirtyfour 34 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface 2906 feet above mean sea level and extending to a horizontal distance of ten thousand 10000 feet along the extended runway centerline 2 transitional zones transitional surfaces slope seven 7 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of 4406 feet mean sea level 3 horizontal zone

will be prohibited based on the definition of a duplicate name given in this section  and 2 simplistic approach to naming will be followed to ensure continuity with existing types of names a master street list will be maintained by the city and provided to the walton county department of public safety and all street names must be presented to the city council for review and approval prior to official acceptance of the proposed naming upon initial development of the master street list all streets that do not meet the standards set forth in the addressing  will be presented for name andor address change according to the process outlined 2 all avenues lying west of us highway 331 south or us highway 331 north and crossed by one of said highways shall be designated as west avenues and all avenues lying east of us highway 331 south or us highway 331 north and crossed by one of said highways shall be designated as east avenues 3 all streets lying north of us highway 90 and crossed by said highway shall be designated as north streets and all streets lying south of us highway 90 and crossed by said highway shall be designated as south streets b street suffix or thoroughfare designations the use of thoroughfare designations as a locational device is a simple method providing a uniform designation of streets of different types in the same jurisdiction street suffix or thoroughfare designation is not required but if it is used it must conform to the definitions that follow boulevard a street divided by a landscaped center island a street with a median reflecting the boulevard character implied in the name court permanently closed street such as a culdesac a minor street less than 500 five hundred feet in length ending in a turnaround drive winding thoroughfares roads that meander about and continue other rightsofway highway designated state or federal highway united states routes are designated as a highway interstate roads of the highest order characterized by limited access wide rightofway prohibited adjacent to development and with traffic preference lane secondary roads connecting with each other reduced rightofway branching from courts places or ways loop and circle circles are short streets that return to themselves circular or semicircular roads loops would be short drives that begin and end in the same street parkway a special scenic route or park drive generally designated by a name path a minor local street running in a diagonal direction pike state primarynumbered roads place a culdesac or permanent deadend road may indicate the direction and to some extent the location of minor or deadend streets lying between thoroughfares road limited thoroughfares that are frequently used have heavy traffic volume and run in any direction square as used to designate a certain portion of land within the limits of a city or town this term may be synonymous with block that is the smallest subdivision which is bounded on all sides by principal streets or it may denote a space more or less rectangular not built upon and set apart for public passage street and avenue a basic principle is that streets and avenues run in different directions streets run north and south and avenues run east and west but this may be reversed as long as a uniform designation is followed within the same jurisdiction trail any curvilinear street a diagonal local street serving as a collector for one 1 or more local thoroughfares way diagonal streets less than one thousand 1000 feet in length a minor street that changes direction or begins and ends on the same thoroughfare the use of thoroughfare designations alone to facilitate locational access will be inadequate in all but the smallest of communities but the use of designations within this standardized application will be beneficial c use of abbreviations for street suffix or thoroughfare designations the united states postal service standard abbreviations will be followed refer to publication 29 usps may 199 postal addressing standards d primary name limitations multiple names with the same primary are restricted within the city as would constitute a duplicate street name as defined in subsection f of this section e private roads all private roads with multiple familybusiness structure must be named and specific addresses assigned to each structure if the private road has only a single structure and the entrance to the private road is from a named road then the private road will be treated as a driveway and an address assigned at the drive with the street name being that of the named road if a private road with no structures leads to one or more private roads with multiple structures then the private road must be named f duplicate street definition duplicate streets will not be allowed as defined in the following examples because a duplicate street name can cause confusion as to the correct location of an emergency and significantly delay response time the united states postal service postal addressing standards publication 28 may 1990 will also be adhered to a duplicate name can prohibit proper routing of calls a duplicate street is a street that can be defined as a street that has the same name as another street and matches the description in one or more of the following cases case 1 street name sounds alike yet is spelled differently and is in an area served by the same fire department eg kathy lane vs cathy lane  wild wood drive vs wildwood drive case 2 street name is plural eg green pasture road vs green pastures road case 3 street has the same primary name yet it has #1 #2 #3 a b c etc as a suffix eg county road 214 vs county road 214a case 4 street is within the same postal delivery office and may span numerous zip codes and has the same primary name with a nondistinguishable suffix or has a suffix omitted eg lakeview road vs lakeview drive  main vs main street case 5 street is within a different postal delivery office from the potential duplicate street however both streets are served by the same fire department case 6 street is not contiguous or does not connect and make a continuous street eg smith road is intersected by interstate 10 however there is no underpass or overpass connecting the two 2 segments of road g street name changes proceedings should be initiated by either a petition of the directly affected property owners or a public official of the jurisdiction in which the street is located the following reasons should be adopted for which a request for change will be considered 1 technical to establish continuity  eliminate duplication  correct misspelling  enhance east of location  improve coherence of street numbering system  or provide a needed roadway designation such as circle or loop 2 neighborhood enhancement recognition to recognize a person or organization  to favor neighborhood association with its location history or area characteristics h assigning streetstructure numbers general principals of numbering principle 1 the building numbers on parallel streets should be comparable this implies that numbers on any one street should progress in the same direction as numbers on parallel streets principle 2 property numbering should be uniform based on street frontage principle 3 numbering should be consecutive principle 4 even numbers should always be on one side of the street and odd numbers on the other principle 5 the numbers system allows for expansion to accommodate future growth in the area i us postal considerations the requirements and policies of the us postal service will be considered in street naming and housing numbering j numbering system the method of assigning numbers is based on the measurement of mileage distance along the roads the first step is to determine the point of origin for each road and consistently number in equal increments from the point of origin this numbering is based on relatively small equal intervals and provides the capability to assign numbers as needed regardless of the lot size of the existing properties unimproved vacant property is not to be assigned a number until there is something constructed upon it k even and odd assignment of address numbers even numbers are assigned to buildings on one side of the street and odd numbers to those on the opposite side of the street if the project is extending addresses on an exiting road follow the same numbering system on each side of the road this should follow a pattern of even on the right and odd on the left side as they increment up even numbers should always be on the right and odd numbers should always be on the left l conflicting street numbers any old or previously assigned number in conflict with the number given by the agency specified by the city council to maintain this system shall be removed and any person refusing or neglecting to remove the same shall be guilty of an offense m responsibility for affixing street numbers 1 to ensure uniformity and regularity in the numbering of structures it shall be the responsibility of the owner of any structure fronting on a named road to place numbers on the structure in so conspicuous a manner that the number may be easily discernible from the opposite side of the street 2 if any structure shall be located too far back from the street for a number on its front to be easily seen and read from the opposite side of the street or the front of the structure is hidden or the view obstructed by trees plants shrubbery or other objects then the number of such structure and premises shall be placed on a post placed in a conspicuous part of the premises whereon the structure is located and shall be discernible from the named road n size and specification for street numbers 1 each street number shall be of any durable material 2 all numbers painted on curbs or driveway approaches shall be black in color on a white rectangular background or the reverse color scheme and of a durable and waterproof finish 3 the numbers shall be a minimum of three 3 inches in height 4 street numbers may be on the driveway approach or curb if the lot has no front driveway the numbers shall be centered on the lot o other numbering guidelines multiunit structures shall use individually addressed primary numbers whenever possible p signage a street sign and a residence or structure marker will complete the link between assigned addresses and location of structures all named roads shall have a sign it is also recommended the following standards be met by all public and private road signs material engineer grade reflective sheeting on aluminum color white letter on green background size and lettering use fourinch series c or b uppercase letters on sixinch street name sign blanks flat blade use twoinch series c or b uppercase letters for lane loop circle etc use twoinch series c or b numbers positioned in the bottom right corner of the sign to designate the block number of the street visibility the sign should be free from any bushes limbs etc which would inhibit the clear view of the sign from the street placement reflecting street signs shall be installed at all intersections and at other points where appropriate along the street signs shall be placed on approved metal posts eight 8 feet above the pavement in accordance with the florida department of
