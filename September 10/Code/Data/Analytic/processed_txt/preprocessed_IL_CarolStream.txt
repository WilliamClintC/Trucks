oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexually oriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv coffering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions dsanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities enumerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films concealed from public view fthe findings noted in divisions a e above raise compelling and substantial governmental concerns gsexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those compelling and substantial governmental concerns ha reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the municipality it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein ithe regulation of nudity seminudity and physical contact between employees and patrons in sexually oriented businesses will further the compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sexrelated crimes including illegal sex acts and protecting the public health safety and welfare jrequiring open sight lines in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare kthe disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare la person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business mbarring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases nstudies in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between sexually oriented businesses and crime including sexrelated crimes like prostitution obscenity and sexual assault this correlation is especially acute when more than one sexually oriented business is located in a neighborhood and when a sexually oriented business is located near a business licensed to serve alcoholic

dstandards 1the zoning board of appeals shall not recommend a variation unless it shall make findings based upon evidence presented to it in the following cases athe property in question other than a singlefamily residential lot cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations governing the district in which it is located  bthe plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances  cthe variation if granted will not alter the essential character of the locality  and dthe plight of the owner is due to the failure of a previous owner of the property in question to follow thenapplicable ordinances or regulations and where the benefit to health safety or appearance to be derived from correcting the nonconformity would not justify the cost or difficulty of the correction the evidence must show that the current owner had no role in the creation of the nonconformity such variation if granted will permit the legal nonconforming status of a building or structure subject to the requirements of  16143 of this code 2for the purpose of supplementing the above standards whenever there are practical difficulties or a particular hardship in making its decision the zoning board of appeals shall also take into consideration the extent to which the following facts favorable to the applicant have been established by the evidence athe particular physical surroundings shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved would bring a particular hardship upon the owner as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the regulation were to be carried out  bthe conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same district  and cthe granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located 3the zoning board of appeals may recommend and the board of trustees may require such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in this section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood and to implement the general purpose and intent of this chapter etypes of variations the zoning board of appeals shall hear and recommend and the board of trustees shall decide only such variations to the regulations of this chapter as follows 1to permit a yard or other required open areas to have less width or depth than herein required by applicable zoning district regulations  2to permit the use of a lot of record on the effective date of this chapter for a use otherwise prohibited solely because of the insufficient area or width of the lot but in no event unless otherwise permitted in this chapter shall the area or width of the lot be less than 90% of the required area or width  3to allow any permitted use to exceed by not more than 10% the floor area ratio or building height regulations of the district where such use is to be located  4to permit the same offstreet parking spaces to qualify as required spaces for two or more uses  provided that the maximum use of such facility by each user does not take place during the same time  5to vary the offstreet parking regulations for a change of use in a conforming building when it is found that adequate offstreet parking facilities exist in the vicinity  or providing the required number of parking spaces on the same lot or within the required distance from it would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of such building as contrasted with merely granting an advantage or convenience  6to permit the reconstruction of a nonconforming building a structure which has been destroyed or damaged by fire act of god or the public enemy to an extent of more than 60% of the total cost of reconstructing the entire building or structure where the zoning board of appeals shall find a compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use  7to permit as in the case

thenapplicable ordinances or regulations such continuation shall be in accordance with the requirements of  16143 of this code  and 8to permit any variation other than those allowable above where such

and structures as related to the land are essentially uniform it is recognized however that there are special uses which because of their unique character cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and upon the public need for the particular use at the particular location as well as upon the ability of the village to supply the special uses with various community services such as adequate treatment of waste water adequate supply of potable water fire protection police protection maintenance of street rightsofway and proper traffic safety such special uses fall into the following two categories 1uses operated by a public agency or publicly regulated utilities or uses traditionally affected with a public interest  or 2uses entirely private in character but of such a nature that the operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon
