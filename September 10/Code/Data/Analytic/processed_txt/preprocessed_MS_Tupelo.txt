2 findings of fact a tupelo mississippi is subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 1  2 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 1  2 objectives the objectives of this article are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to

relationship to comprehensive plan the city of tupelo adopted a comprehensive plan in 2008 that promotes a different development pattern than currently exists in much of the city one that is more compact and walkable this written to specifically address design goals of the comprehensive plan those goals include higher density mixing of uses and the encouragement of infill and redevelopment all of these goals require careful design and a flexible approach the a number of flexibility provisions defined standards for building size location on sites architecture and site improvements can be adjustable according to the context of the development and owner needs these mechanisms include the adoption of five mixed use zoning districts chapters 4 and 5 in which developers will be able to choose between walkable and conventional development standards the code allows more uses by right in most zoning districts and more density of development in many districts a development review checklist  is used to incentivize good design and to evaluate variance requests in terms of the project context providing these flexibility options requires that the code offer guidance on how much flexibility is appropriate in different situations the descriptive material about each zoning district in chapters 4 and 5 provides insight as to the comprehensive plans intent for each district this chapter will focus on the relationship of the individual development to its context and its own functional requirements while a code with an emphasis on flexibility is more complex to administer attention to detail in the design and review of new development should ensure that new developments can be integrated appropriately into existing neighborhoods or commercial areas 62 general provisions  applicability this chapter applies to any application for development approval except as otherwise provided the chapter provides design standards for residential development and for walkable and conventional mixeduse and nonresidential development these standards include site design which includes the visual quality of the property in relation to its context and the design of buildings themselves the chapter also provides standards for site infrastructure  administrative exceptions 1 to facilitate flexibility in design while maintaining the safety health and welfare of the public the director of development services may grant administrative exceptions to the following technical design requirements found in the following sections of this chapter a open space standards 66  b stormwater management  67  c street design and transportation 68  d utilities 69 2 no administrative exception shall be granted unless a the director of development services certifies that the proposed exception does not conflict with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan  and b the applicant demonstrates or studies based on generally accepted engineering principles that the proposed exception would not pose a threat to health and safety  variances where an administrative exception is not granted or where an administrative exception is not permitted as in the case of street connectivity maximum parking requirements and other items not enumerated in this section the applicant may seek a variance pursuant to of this code  construction standards all construction

comprehensive plan the city of tupelo 2025 comprehensive plan includes a number of goals for better design with the intent that future growth of the city be more attractive more accessible and more economically productive this division provides for lots blocks buildings and structures that provide a pedestrian scale offer alternative paths for vehicular traffic and accommodate onstreet parking standards are provided to ensure that lots have adequate access and conform to the zoning provisions of the development city of tupelo finds and determines that long blocks lined with homes and other buildings reduce street connectivity and impair the efficiency of public and safety services while increasing distances between residences and nonresidential destinations or public gathering places exceptions to these standards are made for nonurban districts and zoning districts that require greater flexibility in order to encourage environmental protection or economic development  pedestrian scale and conventional standards distinguished for the purposes of implementing the goals and objectives in the land use plan the city of tupelo has adopted two types of development standards one intended to provide for a walkable pedestrianfriendly environment and one to accommodate conventional development pattern focused on access by automobiles the basic development standards of the mixed

approaches shall be used a use setbacks that are within twentyfive percent 25% of the average setbacks for existing uses on the same block provided that no new use is closer to the right of way than any existing use  b ensure the faade width and height of structures on opposing sides of a street are consistent with each other such that neither faade exceeds the others dimensions by more than twentyfive 25% percent  c graduate building height and mass in the form of building stepbacks or other techniques so that structures with a higher intensity have a comparable scale with adjacent structures housing lower intensity uses  d use similarly sized and patterned architectural features such as windows doors awnings arcades pilasters wall offsets building materials and other building articulations present on the lower intensity or existing use  e locate offstreet parking and service areas to the rear of structures adjacent to similar site features on adjacent sites  f avoid abrupt changes in roof form by using similar roof types slopes or arrangements on the developing site  g orient primary building facades directly across from opposing primary facades regardless of use type  and h when dealing with multibuilding developments establish a continuum of use intensity where uses of moderate intensity are sited between highintensity uses and lower intensity uses 66 open space  purpose open space adds to the visual character and uniqueness of each development and allows for recreational and aesthetic enjoyment by the residents in the agricultureopen space zoning district open space is provided by land in agricultural use or floodplains in the residential zoning districts improved open space provides centrally located community gathering spots and play spaces that are integral to the livability of the neighborhoods while the preservation of natural areas ensures habitat in the mixed use districts a limited quantity of open space is required as relief from the intensity of the built environment except for ownership and management of open space the requirements of this section do not apply to conservation subdivisions under conservation subdivision  required open space open space shall be required in all proposed uses of land which require development approval by the planning committee andor city council in all districts except agricultureopen space mixed

section is to provide adequate measures for the retention detention and distribution of stormwater in a manner that minimizes the possibility of adverse impacts on both water quantity and water quality during development and on adjoining properties during and after development  applicability this section applies to any application for subdivision plat site plan or development approval except as otherwise provided in this chapter a stormwater report shall be provided as set forth in the city of tupelo design standards and construction specifications for streets storm water sanitary sewer and water distribution  system criteria 1 design conditions stormwater management facilities shall normally be designed for proposed development three 3 development conditions shall be analyzed for each development as follows 1 existing conditions current development conditions in the watershed and on site use as the baseline analysis for determining the impact of development 2 proposed conditions existing conditions with the proposed development added use to determine if the increased runoff from the proposed development results in an adverse impact to other properties 3 ultimate conditions ultimate development conditions within the watershed used to design the drainage facilities ultimate development conditions may be used in lieu of proposed conditions to determine if the increased runoff from the ultimate watershed development results in an adverse impact to other properties or for projects located within designated watershed protection districts at the discretion of the city engineer 2 design storm event all drainage facilities shall be designed for a twentyfive 25 year storm facilities that are to convey drainage along the flooding source of a designated special flood hazard areas sfha or one hundred 100 year floodplain as defined on the flood insurance rate maps firm must be designed using the one hundred 100 year one percent 1% chance flood event 3 responsibility to accept stormwater the owner or developer of property to be developed is responsible for the conveyance of all stormwater flowing property this responsibility includes stormwater flowing onto the property by any other developed property as well as the drainage naturally flowing property by reason of topography future upstream development shall be accounted for by assuming ultimate development when sizing drainage systems as specified in this section 4 level of service for new developmentredevelopment peak stormwater runoff rates from all new development and redevelopment projects due to zoning or replatting shall be less than or equal to the peak runoff rates from the sites predevelopment or existing conditions for the twentyfive 25 and one hundred 100 year design storm events special consideration may be given to developments that discharge runoff directly to major drainage ways such as creeks and streams provided the increased runoff will not adversely impact the stream in question or adjoining properties 5 low impact stormwater management design use of low impact stormwater management integrated management practices and design features that are consistent with the practices described in lowimpact development design strategies an integrated design approach and lowimpact development hydrologic analysis which are incorporated by reference and are referred to as the lid manuals are encouraged by reference in the plan goals and design options checklist 6 where applicable compliance with the national pollution discharge elimination system npdes permit process is required 68 street design and transportation  purpose these regulations are designed to 1 ensure that the design of streets conforms to the recommendations of the comprehensive plan  2 provide for the safety for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic  3 provide for livable residential and commercial environments  4 provide economy of land use construction and maintenance  and 5 provide safe and efficient access to property  intent unlike the situation in traditional subdivision regulations one intent of this section is to permit narrower street widths while requiring greater connectivity in order to more efficiently disperse traffic to protect pedestrians from high vehicular speeds and to enhance the streetscape the city of tupelo further finds and determines that street layout and design can have a very significant influence on the total imperviousness and hydrology of a site alternative road layout can result in significantly reducing imperviousness reducing stormwater runoff protecting water quality and providing cost savings for developers and home buyers  applicability this section applies to 1 any application for subdivision plat approval  and 2 any application for site plan or development plan approval if no subdivision plat is required  classification classification of an existing or proposed street not already identified on the major street plan for the purpose of determining the appropriate design of a roadway or development or for the purpose of determining the appropriateness of a location for a proposed use shall be done by the city engineer pursuant to the major street plan the following classification system as described in table 68 is adopted additional information on street classification and standards is provided in appendix a city of tupelo design standards and construction specifications for streets stormwater water distribution and sanitary sewer see exceptions to sidewalk requirements in section 2 1 arterials arterials may be classified as either principal or minor but for purposes of this manual and within the context of the city of tupelo no such separate distinction will be made arterials are defined as corridors generating the highest traffic volumes with the longest trip desires and are commonly referred to as major thoroughfares the arterial system generally will consist of multiple lanes of traffic will serve the major centers of activity and will be the primary routes entering and leaving the urban area as well as providing routes for intraarea travel such as between business districts and outlying residential areas gloster street main street and mccullough boulevard are examples of arterials within the city of tupelo for design considerations of this manual all arterials within the city of tupelo will be assumed to carry five percent 5% heavy truck traffic 2 collectors the collector system provides land service access and traffic circulation within business districts residential neighborhoods and industrial areas a collector gathers traffic from within specific land use zones and distributes it to the arterial system collectors within the city of tupelo may be classified as either major or minor major collectors function as primary routes between land use zones and tie directly into the arterial system they will carry high volumes of traffic adt > 2000 both commercial and residential green street thomas street and west jackson street are examples of major collectors within the city of tupelo for design purposes of this manual all major collectors within the city of tupelo will be assumed to carry two percent 2% heavy truck traffic unless the designer is directed to accommodate a higher or lower percentage by the city engineer minor collectors generally serve outlying residential and smaller confined business districts they will distribute traffic between neighborhoods and major collectors carrying less volume adt < 2000 than a major collector they may or may not tie into the arterial system butler road lakeshire drive and wilson street are examples of minor collectors within the city of tupelo heavy truck traffic will be considered negligible on minor collectors unless special consideration is ordered by the city engineer 3 local streets local streets comprise all facilities that cannot be categorized into one of the other two classifications these include mainly residential streets within distinct neighborhoods and subdivisions they function to distribute traffic to the collector system and beyond and will often carry very low traffic volumes adt < 400 except for industrial districts local streets will be assumed to carry no truck traffic in newly developed subdivisions local streets shall be designed so that blocks do not exceed one thousandfive hundred 1500 feet in the agricultureopen space zoning district one thousand 1000 feet in length in the lowdensity residential zoning district or seven hundredfifty 750 feet in other residential zones unless severe topographic constraints or other unusual features make an excessive length necessary connections between streets shall be created in such a way that they do not encourage the use of such streets by substantial a local street open at only one 1 end should have a culdesac turn around at the closed end such dead end streets should be kept to minimum length as possible and in no instance should a dead end street exceed six hundred 600 feet in length 4 alleys alleys are small low volume streets that provide access to the side or rear of individual parcels of land in medium to high density residential and commercial areas they are categorized separately from local streets in that they are intended in many cases to serve only a few individual parcels in commercial districts they may be used primarily for loading and unloading of goods and other materials in residential districts they may serve as few as two 2 or 3 three separate homes and provide a safer alternative to on street parking on the primary local and collector routes alleys are generally intended for one way traffic only alleys for rear vehicle access are required in traditional housing developments dead end alleys may be permissible in certain situations and where allowed should be equipped with a turn around minimum design criteria for turnarounds are shown on figure 1d of the appendix because of their intended use the geometric criteria for their design will be somewhat less intrusive than that of a local street and is illustrated in figure 1d of the appendix 5 factors to be considered in determining the classification of a street factors to be considered include the following existing or proposed features 1 facility geometrics including the number and width of traffic lanes turning lanes and parking lanes  2 access conditions including any restrictions on access the spacing of private accesses and average lot frontages  3 traffic characteristics including average daily traffic percentage of trucks average operating speed percentage of turning movements origindestination characteristics of the traffic and peakhour

existing vegetation and for the installation and maintenance of new vegetation and other landscape architectural features the purpose of these standards is to 1 improve property and community appearance without compromising community safety including minimization of the visual impact of extensive land disturbance  2 allow for the ecological benefits provided by plant materials including protection of land from unnecessary erosion and watercourse sedimentation reduction of stormwater runoff improvement of air quality and provision of wildlife habitat  3 reduce the heat island effect  4 enhance the beauty of the built environment  and 5 enhance the attractiveness and value of commercial areas and the privacy and welfare of residential areas by buffering incompatible land uses where potential impacts cannot be mitigated compatibility concepts or transitional features  applicability 1 the landscaping and buffering standards of this section shall apply to all proposed development for which a minor or major site plan development plan or preliminary plat is required 2 land used toward achieving the requirements of the section need not hold the same zoning designation as the use
