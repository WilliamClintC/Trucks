residenvelopment division 242 residendevelopment yield sets out the maximum density of residenal development for each zone in which new residenal and predominately residenal mixeduse neighborhoods are allowed the maximum density in each zone varies based on the amount of open space provided in the development the division also describes four types of residenal neighborhoods and sets out the minimum land area and open space that must be provided for each neighborhood type finally the division describes how addional density may be realized for the provision of aordable and aainable housing units or the construcon of dierent housing types see secon 2424 density adjustments for specic housing types c mixeduse and nonresidendevelopment division 243 mixeduse and nonresidendevelopment yield

lot averaging a generally lot averaging is a design technique which replaces a minimum lot area or width with an average lot width and a requirement that certain percentages of lots fall into one of three lot area groups small lots average lots and large lots see figure 3221a lot averaging lot averaging shall be applied as required in subsecon b and is oponal in other cases figure 3221a lot averaging b applicability lot averaging is required as follows 1 lot averaging shall be applied to any single housing type when there are more than 20 units of the housing type in a proposed development eg if there are 30 singlefamily detached units 25 pao home units and 20 standard townhome units in a development then lot averaging must be applied to the singlefamily detached and pao home units but is not required for the townhome units 2 lot area groups for each housing type are provided in the tables of division 322 housing palee 3 where lot averaging is not required but the tables of division 322 housing palee indicate three lot area groups the average lot area group shall be used to establish minimum lot area and minimum lot depth for the housing type c exceplot averaging is not required for agricultural equestrian and estate lots as described in secon 3222 singlefamily detached d idenying each group each size group are idened by lot width as follows 1 small lots shall meet the minimum lot width for small lots and their lot width may be up to but not including the lot width of the average lot category 2 average lots shall meet the minimum lot width for average lots and their lot width may be up to but not including the lot width of the large lot category 3 large lots must meet the minimum lot width for large lots and their width is not limited e calculathe required number of each lot area group in the tables of division 322 housing palee that provide for variable lot sizes the column tled percent in width type indicates the minimum proporon of each lot area group that must be provided the minimum number of small and average lots shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number the large lot category is always listed as remainder because aer the minimum proporons for small and average lots are met the remainder of the lots may be large lots f distribuof averaged in the three lot area groups shall be distributed in at least one of the following ways 1 generally lots in each of the three lot area groups small lots average lots and large lots shall be mixed on each street segment so that they are spread development except as provided in subsecon f2 below concentrang lots of a single lot area group in separate areas of a development is not allowed 2 in the alternave proposed development that includes a mix of housing types may designate a mix of housing types or diverse singlefamily detached lot sizes on a single block or street segment such developments are not required to strictly comply with subsecon f1 above if it is

dierences in peak parking demand periods the city may reduce the required number of spaces according to the provisions of this secon b shared parking table shared parking allows a reducon in the total number of required parking spaces when a parcel is occupied by two or more uses which typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same me when any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed below the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the following procedures 1 mulply the minimum required parking for each individual use excluding spaces reserved for use by specied individuals or classes of individuals except car share programs by the appropriate percentage listed in table 4529 shared parking table for each of the designated me

architectural styles that balances two connuums both of which have ends that at their extremes are unaracve the balance shall be struck between a monotony and chaos  and b unity and interest 2 quality quality refers to the materials and care with which a building or environment is built as well as its visual richness eg details that are aracve to the resident or visitor in order to ensure visual interest a paern book shall demonstrate the following a dwelling units are designed to provide a unied appearance from the street with all streetfacing elevaons ie front faade and street side faade having comparable treatment in materials color and trim b if masonry is used on a front elevaon it is also applied to side elevaons in one or more of the following ways 1 masonry returns to a break in the side elevaon such as a chimney room projecon or projecng window area  2 an architectural return is applied to all corners so that the greater of 10 percent of the length of the side building wall or three feet is nished with masonry to the same height as the front facade  3 quoins are used if consistent with the architectural typology of the building  4 an architectural detail with a minimum width of 16 inches is applied such as a pilaster that caps the masonry and the other material that completes the corner  or 5 a wing wall screens the view of the side of the building from the street c detached singlefamily homes will be arculated and detailed and shall avoid undue imposion of building mass on the street d there is detailing of doors windows and their trim that carries around the buildings sides so that even if the trim is plain there is a visual relaonship to the general style and character of the front elevaon e front porches will be provided on all detached housing types f outdoor living space will be provided for each unit on all townhomes and mulfamily buildings g ulity meters will not be on streetfacing elevaons unless screened by vegetaon or other approved screening 3 diversity a paern book shall demonstrate that one or more of the techniques below will be used to achieve harmony a paern book is not required to include all of these elements a varied housing types at a finegrained scale mulple housing types are required yet this requirement could result in areas or pods of each type which has the potenal to lead to monotony mixing types on a smaller scale even having diering dwelling unit types in a block face is a technique to reduce monotony and add interest b varied architectural styles dierent architectural styles can be used to vary the appearance of buildings with comparable oor plans the variaons in architectural styles must be meaningful but must not create a chaoc appearance for this technique to be reviewed a number of elements including roof type and orientaon roof pitch eave overhangs windows doors and decorave elements shall be specied for each architectural style that will be used in the development the reference for architectural style is a field guide to american houses by virginia and lee mcalester et al knopf 1984 c varied floor plans if oor plans are meaningfully dierent homes will look dierent if oor plans are not meaningfully dierent homes will oen look monotonous the dierences in oor plans must signicantly alter the width and shape in order to present a building volume or mass that is dierent such dierences include but are not limited to 1 obvious changes in the width of the front elevaon of the building  2 dierent forms rectangle l or x shapes if the dierences aect the front faade  3 dierent numbers of stories  or 4 dierent symmetry symmetrical or asymmetrical d varied gable orientaon in many cases a front or side gable roof can be constructed over the same oor plan this change signicantly alters the roof prole of the house its front elevaon massing and may also alter the height of the roof peak e varied elements a paern book may demonstrate that architectural elements will be varied in a way that creates meaningful dierences in building appearance such details may include trims materials color window arrangement grouping window fenestraon doors door lights window and garage doors porches chimneys bay windows cupolas towers and balconies as necessary to create the required variaon this technique is parcularly useful when a single architectural style or two very closely related styles eg prairie and crasman are used in the development a paern book must include detailed elevaons lists of specic elements to be used and an explanaon of how the elements will be mixed to dierenate nearby buildings f averaged lot width meaningful variaon of lot width generally causes meaningful variaons in building width and oor plan a paern book may show that street segments will include lots of varying widths as follows 1 three lot size categories for each type of housing are created using a required average eg 50 percent of the lots would be average 25 percent small and 25 percent large 2 the dierence in frontage among the lot sizes should be in the range of 10 to 20 percent for example for an average 10000 square foot lot that is 80 feet wide is 125 feet deep the small lot could be 70 feet wide and the large lot 90 feet wide the resulng lots all 125 feet deep would have areas of 8750 10000 and 11250 square feet 4 light and air the paern of development and the open space

prepared with the consultaon of the state forest service personnel its resources and including any forest service recommendaons also see secon 1010 1 the wildlandurban interface wui is a geographical area where structures and other human development meets or intermingles with wildland or vegetave fuels the wui creates a potenally dangerous situaon for ames or embers from a wildland re to come in contact with structures the purpose of these guidelines is to provide a means to protect the public health safety and welfare by establishing recommendaons for development within a wildlandurban interface area in order to a reduce threats to life safety property and resources by improving development and construcon standards access to and defensibility of developments homes and other property in wui areas  b minimize the potenal of spreading re from wildland areas to structures and from structure res to wildland areas  c idenfy the appropriate use of culdesacs hammer head turnarounds and turnouts on streets and roads providing legal and physical access to subdivisions with the intent to provide beer emergency access to remote areas  d encourage homeowners and neighborhoods to plan create and maintain defensible space that ulizes re resistant construcon and landscaping  2 defensible space is an area either natural or manmade where materials capable of allowing a re to spread unchecked have been treated cleared or modied to slow the rate and intensity of wildre and which create an area for re suppression to occur consistent applicaon of these treatments will create condions where a crown re could be transformed into a ground re slowing its rate of spread and creang an opportunity for re suppression resources to safely respond there are three defensible space zones a zone 1 an area measured 30 feet around the structure the goal in this zone is to reduce the potenal home ignion sources what is done now will greatly enhance structure survivability firewood and other debris around or under the structure should be relocated keep roof and rainguers clear of needles and leaves during the re season i maintain noncombusble ground material 2 to 3 feet around structure planng beds rock gardens pavers gravel or bare soil ii remove all pine needles & ammable ground materials iii prune tree limbs and branches within 10 feet of the roof iv remove tree limbs and branches within 10 feet of chimney v use re resistant construcon plants and landscaping concepts in this zone vi consider low combusble ground covers and nonammable landscape material vii do not let ammable vegetaon touch or overhang the home viii ensure vegetaon is not a species that retains dead material or deposits excessive quanes of ground fuel ix ensure vegetaon is located far enough away from the home so that they will not ignite the home by direct ame contact or radiant heat emission b zone 2 the size of this zone depends on the slope and property boundaries but is typically 75 to 125 feet from the structure i the fuel load should be reduced by removing dead trees and shrubs thinning and pruning trees and keeping grasses to 6 inches or less ii remove all ladder fuels iii maintain 20 feet between crowns of nave trees or clumps iv 20 feet between planng islands v prune nave tree limbs 15 feet from ground vi provide added protecon with fuel breaks such as driveways gravel walkways and lawns vii provide access for re apparatus access to your remaining property viii consider coordinaon with neighboring properes ix store rewood and other combusbles in this zone c zone 3 extends from the edge of zone 2 to the property line and is an area of tradional forest management enhancing the overall health of the forest i remove heavy accumulaons of woody debris such as piles of stem wood or branches ii remove all ladder fuels iii maintain 15 feet between crowns of nave trees or clumps iv prune nave tree limbs min 8 to 15 feet from ground or 13 of crown which ever is less v coordinate with neighboring properes vi treat enre perimeter of property 3 site development a chimneys buildings and building sites are discouraged within ravines or other topographical features which constute re chimneys and within 150 feet of the apex of re chimneys any proposed lot within a new subdivision with a re chimney located on the lot should have a nobuild areazone designated on the face of the nal plat for the subdivision that prohibits future development within re chimneys and within 150 feet of the apex of re chimneys b improvements prior to construcon water sources wells dra sites hydrants re breaks access routes and other re protecon equipment or features required by the preliminary plat approval should be installed prior to construcon of any residenal or commercialindustrial structures in a new subdivision c fuelbreaks and greenbelts wui re protecon may rely on fuelbreaks and greenbelts to separate communies groups of structures or individual homes these breaks can slow or stop the spread of an oncoming re i locate fuelbreaks and greenbelts to protect both exisng and planned developments and adjacent wildlands fuelbreaks should not be a bare soil trail bulldozed around a subdivision but can be as simple as the removal of dead and fallen trees tree limbs shrubs and other ammable vegetaon together with breaking the connuity of vegetaon around the perimeter of the development ii natural features such as rocky formaons with lile or no vegetaon or rivers or streambeds in which vegetaon has been thinned and dead and dying materials removed can also be ulized 4 construcon of residenal commercial or accessory structures the construcon of new residenal commercial or accessory structures and the substanal improvement relocaon and replacement of exisng structures should consider re resistant construcon techniques 5 means of access the majority of nonreghter deaths during wildland res occurs during evacuaon or aempts to escape from a re front access to developed areas requires that public and private roads bridges and driveways be properly constructed to provide for safe ingress and egress for re personnel and equipment and the public denions clumps means groups of trees where crowns are less than 10 feet apart crown means the outer edge of tree or clumps of trees pine needle removal means to rake only down to the decomposing layer to avoid erosion problems ladder fuels means vegetaon of dierent heights close enough to allow a surface re to spread vercally to the top of a tree ~ wildre mia a generally wildre
