gully brook goff brook moody brook and salmon brook along with their tributaries are potentially threatened by pollutants associated with existing land use and future development  and whereas the city

meet existing and future needs and flooding concerns may arise  and whereas requirements of the us environmental protection agency epa demand a comprehensive approach to municipal stormwater management and the city wishes to take a proactive approach to these requirements  and the city council makes the following additional findings  the stormwater management needs of the city have been identified in a needs analysis entitled stormwatercso utility feasibility study preliminary results dated  by camp dresser and mckee inc and an analysis entitled clean water act master plan dated  by

stormwater facilities and activities associated with stormwater management provide services and benefits to all properties property owners residents and citizens of the city utilities lewiston ch   given the scope of stormwater management needs identified by the stormwater studies it is appropriate and necessary to authorize the formation of a stormwater utility unit as a program comprised of

enhance the stormwater management programs services systems and facilities of the city  in order to establish operate and maintain the stormwater infrastructure of the city ensure the future usefulness of the existing system improvements and provide other services associated with stormwater and watershed management sufficient and stable funding is required for the operation maintenance and improvement of the stormwater management programs services systems and facilities of the city  a stormwater utility service fee schedule that efficiently takes into account impervious surface area and uses intensity and nature of land use as the most appropriate and equitable method of allocating the cost of stormwater management programs services systems and facilities of the city and between and among rural and urbanized areas of the city and residential dwelling units nonresidential properties and other developed lands for governing assessments and collections of the utility  purpose stormwater runoff is one 1 of the largest contributors to water quality violations in urban and urbanizing areas of maine according to the us epa polluted stormwater runoff is a leading cause of impairment to the nearly forty 40 percent of surveyed us water bodies which do not meet water quality standards us epa 1995 when polluted stormwater runoff is discharged directly into surface water bodies several adverse effects can occur public health can be threatened from contaminated drinking water sources food sources and recreational waters  aquatic habitats can be damaged or destroyed  and aesthetic values of waterways can decline management of stormwater is critical to ensuring the integrity of valuable surface water resources an effective approach to managing stormwater and related impacts is creation of a utility that delivers stormwater management services to a community therefore the city hereby establishes a stormwater management utility for the following purposes

ringlemann no 1 indicates a 20 percent density of the smoke observed b all measurements shall be taken at the point of emission of the smoke c in all residential districts and the or district no nonresidential use may emit from a vent stack chimney or combustion process any smoke that is visible to the naked eye d in the io cb hb d os and ue districts no nonresidential use may emit from a vent stack chimney or combustion process any smoke that exceeds a density or equivalent capacity of ringlemann no 1 except that an emission that does not exceed a density or equivalent capacity of ringlemann no 2 is permissible for a duration of not more than four minutes during any eighthour period if the source of such emission is not located within 250 feet of a residential district e in the

not exceed a density or equivalent capacity of ringlemann no 3 is permissible for a duration not more appendix a  zoning and land use code article xii performance standards lewiston xii52 than four minutes during any eighthour period if the source of emission is not located within 500 feet of a residential district 2 noise a a decibel is a measure of a unit of sound pressure since sound waves having the same decibel level sound louder or softer to the human ear depending upon the frequency of the sound wave in cyclespersecond ie whether the pitch of the sound is high or low an aweighted

shall be used on any sound level meter taking measurements required by this section and accordingly all measurements are expressed in dba to reflect the use of this aweighted filter b the standards established in the table set forth below are expressed in terms of the equivalent sound level leq which must be calculated by taking 100 instantaneous aweighted sound levels at tensecond intervals and computing the leq c except as provided in subsections d and e the following table establishes the maximum permissible noise levels for nonresidential uses measurements shall be taken at the boundary line of the lot where the nonresidential use is located and as indicated the maximum permissible noise levels vary according to the zoning of the lot adjacent to the lot on which the use is located table of maximum permitted sound levels dba zoning of adjacent lot residential and or business io os and ue i maximum sound level 50 60 70 d in cases where measurements taken in accordance with subsections a and b demonstrate that the existing leq exceeds the maximum permissible sound levels established in subsection c then the nonresidential use may not generate sound levels greater than the measured existing sound levels e impact noises are sounds that occur intermittently rather than continuously impact noises generated by sources that do not operate more than one minute in any onehour period are permissible up to a level of ten dba in excess of the figures listed in the table except that this higher level of permissible noise shall not apply from  pm to  am when the
