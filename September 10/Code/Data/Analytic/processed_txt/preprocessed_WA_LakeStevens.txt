effects of the activities defined and regulated in this chapter are detrimental to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such activities must be regulated bregulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred this history of criminal activity in the adult entertainment industry has included prostitution illegal employment of minors narcotics and alcoholic beverage law violations breaches of the peace tax evasion and the presence within the industry of individuals with hidden ownership interests and outstanding arrest warrants cproximity between entertainers and patrons during adult entertainment performances can facilitate sexual contact prostitution and related crimes concerns about crime and public sexual activity are legitimate and compelling concerns of the city which demand reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments in order to protect the public health safety and general welfare dthe activities described in subsections b and c of this section occur in the absence of regulation regardless of whether the adult entertainment is presented in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages eit is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult and to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible fit is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of establishments offering adult entertainment at such times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the adult entertainment establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees gthe license fees required in this chapter are necessary as nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the adult entertainment industry hhidden ownership interests for the purposes of skimming profits and avoiding the payment of taxes have historically occurred in the adult entertainment industry in the absence of regulation these hidden ownership interests have historically been held by organized and white collar crime elements in order for the city to effectively protect the public health safety morals and general welfare of its citizens and effectively allocate its law enforcement resources it is important that the city be fully apprised of the actual ownership of adult entertainment establishments and the identities and backgrounds of persons responsible for management and control of the adult entertainment establishment iit is not the intent of this chapter to suppress or censor any expressive activities protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution or of the washington state constitution but rather to enact time place and manner regulations which address the compelling interests of the city in mitigating the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments jin addition findings of facts developed by the city of tukwila and other jurisdictions

but are included in         use of the designations p a c in table of permissible uses athe table of permissible uses table 1440i sets forth which uses are permitted in which zones the letter p means the use is permitted or allowed in the indicated zone district subject to all code requirements of this title the letter a means the use requires an administrative conditional use permit and the letter c means the use requires a conditional use permit no letter means that use is not permitted in the indicated zone district bwhen used in connection with residential uses use classification  the designation pac means that such developments of less than five dwelling units are a permitted use when code requirements are met developments of five or more but less than 13 dwelling units need an administrative conditional use permit and developments of 13 or more dwelling units require a conditional use permit cwhen used in connection with nonresidential uses the designation pa means that such developments are permitted if the lot to be developed is less than one acre in size and require an administrative conditional use permit if the lot is one acre or larger in area  and the designation pc means that such developments are permitted if the lot to be developed is less than one acre in size and require a conditional use permit if the lot is one acre or larger in area duse of the designation pac for combination uses is explained in             jurisdiction over uses otherwise permissible whenever this title provides that a use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permissible an administrative conditional use permit shall nevertheless be required if the planning director finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public in making this determination the planning director shall consider among other factors whether the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another whether the use is proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties and whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are permissible in the zoning district in question       permissible and prohibited uses athe presumption established by this title is that all legitimate uses of land are addressed within the table of permissible uses and are either allowed or not allowed thereby but because the list of permissible uses set forth at the end of this chapter cannot be all inclusive those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses bwithout limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions the following uses are specifically prohibited in all districts 1any use that involves the manufacture handling sale distribution or storage of any highly combustible or explosive materials in violation of the citys fire prevention code 2stockyards slaughterhouses

as a principal use in this table is conducted in conjunction with another principal use constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then it may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a swimming pooltennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed apart from a residential development would require an administrative conditional use permit use classification  bfor purposes of interpreting subsection a of this section 1a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use  2to be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness cwithout limiting the generality of subsections a and b of this section the following activities so long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above are specifically regarded as accessory to residential principal uses 1home occupations 2hobbies or recreational activities of a noncommercial nature 3the renting out of one or two rooms within a singlefamily residence which one or two rooms do not themselves constitute a separate dwelling unit other than on a daily or weekly

inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in e may result in a development either with inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs the former situation may lead to traffic congestion or parking violations in adjacent streets as well as unauthorized parking in nearby private lots the latter situation wastes money as well as space that could more desirably be used for valuable development or environmentally useful open space therefore as suggested in the permitissuing authority may permit deviations from the presumptive requirements of e and may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standard set forth in a bwithout limiting the generality of the foregoing the permitissuing authority may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in e when it finds that 1a residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly or other demographic group which due to the driving characteristics of the group requires fewer or more parking stalls than the general populace  2a sole business not part of a larger mall is primarily oriented to walkin trade cwhenever the permitissuing authority allows or requires a deviation from the presumptive parking requirements set forth in e it shall enter on the face of the permit the parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring the deviation dif the permitissuing authority concludes based upon information it receives in the consideration of a specific development proposal that the presumption established by e for a particular use classification is erroneous it shall initiate a request for an amendment to the table of parking requirements in accordance with the procedures set forth in c075   parking space dimensions asubject to subsections b and c of this section each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least 19 feet long and nine feet wide

to have more than 10 parking spaces per the table of parking requirements and 3 the parking spaces are not to be used regularly at least five days per week then the vehicle accommodation areas that contain parking areas need not be paved as specified in subsection a of this section instead the vehicle accommodation area may be graded and surfaced with crushed stone gravel or other suitable material as provided in the specifications set forth in the administrative guideline entitled vehicle accommodation area surfaces to provide a surface that is stable and will help to reduce dust and erosion the perimeter of such parking areas shall be defined by bricks stones railroad ties or other similar devices in addition whenever such a vehicle accommodation area abuts a paved street the

credited to any other use bto the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the same parking spaces operate at different times the same spaces may be credited to both uses for example if a parking lot is used in connection with an office building on monday but is generally 90 percent vacant on weekends another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with 90 percent of the spaces on that lot or if a church parking lot is generally occupied only to 50 percent of capacity on days other than sunday another development could make use of 50 percent of the church lots spaces on those other days cif the joint use of the same parking spaces by two or more principal uses involves satellite parking spaces then the provisions of also applicable  satellite

parking spaces except spaces intended for employee use must be located within 400 feet of a public entrance of a principal building housing the use associated with such parking or within 400 feet of the lot on which the use associated with such parking is located if the use is not housed within any principal building satellite parking spaces intended for employee use may be located within any reasonable distance cthe developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this section must present satisfactory written evidence that he has the permission of the owner or other person in charge of the satellite parking spaces to use such spaces the developer must also sign an acknowledgement that the continuing validity of his permit depends upon his continuing ability to provide the requisite number of parking spaces dpersons who obtain satellite parking spaces in accordance with this section shall not be held accountable for ensuring that the satellite parking areas from which they obtain their spaces satisfy the design requirements of this chapter  special provisions for existing buildings notwithstanding any other provisions of this title whenever a there exists a lot

council findings concerning the need for screening requirements the council finds that 1screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of noise dust and glare 2screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use 3screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening 4the provisions of this part are necessary to safeguard the public health safety and welfare   general screening standard every development which abuts a different zone district shall

that 1trees are proven producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival  2trees appreciably reduce the ever increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breathe  3trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the airwasher devices used on commercial air conditioning systems  4trees have an important role in neutralizing waste water passing ground from the surface to ground water tables and lower aquifers  5trees root systems stabilize the ground water tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control  6trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land particularly parking areas  and 7for the reasons indicated in subsection a6 of this section trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values bbased upon these findings the council declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health safety and welfare of all persons living or working within the city to protect certain existing trees and to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments     required trees along dedicated streets along both sides of all newly created widened or improved streets the developer shall either plant or retain within the landscape strip every 30 feet of street frontage one deciduous tree of two inches dbh at the time of planting with a canopy that starts at least eight feet above finished grade and will have a trunk at least 12 inches in diameter when fully mature root deflectors shall be provided for all street trees when trees are planted by the developer pursuant to this section the developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in the administrative guideline entitled guide for landscaping paving or covering the landscape strip with impervious material or to park motor vehicles on the landscape strip is prohibited     retention and protection of large trees aevery development shall retain all existing significant trees and significant stands of trees unless the retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development or in the opinion of the planning director cause a significant safety problem the applicant for a land use permit or preliminary subdivision approval shall with the application submit an assessment prepared by a certified arborist which makes recommendations for protection of trees consistent with this chapter bthe retention of significant trees and significant stands of trees unreasonably burdens a development if the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer cwhere significant trees and significant stands of trees are removed because their retention would unreasonably burden a development a tree survey shall be provided showing size type and location of all significant trees and stands of trees prior to removal the developer shall coordinate with the city which trees are to be protected dany unprotected significant trees removed shall be replaced with onegallonsized native species at a ratio of  during plat and home construction the developer shall provide adequate protection of retained and replacement trees from damage eif it is physically impractical to replant all replacement trees on site then the applicant shall mitigate the loss of trees by either planting trees on public property within the city as approved by the planning director andor paying a mitigation fee into the citys tree mitigation inlieu fund this fee shall be set forth in the citys fee resolution and equal the cost of purchasing and planting the trees fprior to any clearing activities the city shall map and inventory all trees identified for protection if any of the protected trees are removed or damaged to the extent that their ability to survive is seriously threatened without the citys prior written consent the loss shall be remedied pursuant to c greplacement trees approved to be installed on public property shall be planted prior to recordation of a final plat or issuance of a building permit whichever comes first hreplacement trees approved to be installed on residential lots shall be planted prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for that lot iif space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of subsection a or b of this section and as a result the parking requirements set forth in cannot be satisfied the number of required spaces may be reduced by the number of spaces lost because of the provisions of subsections a and b of this section up to a maximum of 15 percent of the required spaces jwhenever construction clearing or grading activities occur on a site in which trees are required to be protected pursuant to this title the following measures shall be taken to ensure said protection 1prior to commencing any site work the applicant shall submit a plan to the department of planning and community development which identifies types and locations of barriers that will be placed around protected trees to aid in the avoidance of accidental damage to the trees no site work will commence prior to the city inspecting and approving the location and installation of the barriers 2no fill excavation or other subsurface disturbance operating stacking or storing of equipment or compacting of earth may be undertaken within the drip line of any of the protected trees and no impervious surface may be located within 1212 feet measured from the center of the trunk of any tree 18 inches in diameter or more a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground 3where vehicularequipment access is required within the drip line of a tree the soil and incidentally the trees roots shall be protected with 10 inches of woodchips andor plywood placed over the path of the vehicle to limit soil compaction and subsequent root damage before any vehicles may travel protected area the developer shall submit an affidavit from a certified arborist that measures installed are sufficient to protect the trees in question 4stumps of trees to be removed within onehalf of the radius of the critical root zone crz which is defined as crz equals one foot radius for every one inch of the trees diameter shall not be excavated but may be ground down to below the ground surface 5unwanted vegetation within the crz of a protected tree shall be removed by hand 6backfilling into a crz of a protected tree shall be done only with the written approval of a certified arborist only well drained soil with sufficient air space sandy soils are permitted 7upon completion of site clearing protected trees may be pruned for deadwood low hanging limbs and proper balance under the supervision of a certified arborist trees may be cabled and braced as recommended by the arborist           shade trees on residential aeach residential lot shall maintain a minimum number of trees on site this section shall be enforced at the time that any land use or building permit is issued if fewer than the required trees exist on a lot for which a land use or building permit is applied the granting of the permit shall be conditioned on the planting of trees to meet the requirements of this section bthe minimum number of required trees depends on the zoning district in which the site falls as follows suburban residential waterfront residential  three treeslot urban residential high urban residential  two treeslot except lots developed planned residential development  or a cluster subdivision   three treeslot for lots greater than or equal to 9600 square feet two treeslot for lots less than 9600 square feet cif street trees are present or are required to be installed with a development they may count toward one of the trees required by subsection b of this section don lake front

enonstreet trees required per this section shall be a native species have a minimum twoinch diameter at breast height dbh and attain a minimum height of 25 feet at maturity fat least one of the required trees shall be planted near the rear property line of the lot the intent of this regulation is to create rows of trees behind and between rows of houses thus affording privacy and creating a forested view of the community when seen from ground level       shade trees in parking areas apaved vehicle accommodation areas must be shaded by deciduous trees that will have when fully mature a trunk at least 12 inches in diameter the developer shall choose trees that meet the standards set forth in the administrative guideline entitled guide for landscaping beach tree of the type described in subsection a of this section shall be presumed to shade a circular area having a radius of 15 feet with the trunk of the tree as the center and there must be sufficient trees so that using this standard 20 percent of the vehicle accommodation area will be shaded cexcept as noted in subsection d of this section no paving may be placed within 12 12 feet measured from the center of the trunk of any tree retained to comply with subsection a of this section dpervious paving grasscrete metal grating etc may be used within 12 12 feet of a tree if 1 the parking lot is designed so that no significant runoff from the paved areas drains into the area around the base of the trees and 2 barriers are placed in such a manner as to prevent vehicles from damaging such trees evehicle
