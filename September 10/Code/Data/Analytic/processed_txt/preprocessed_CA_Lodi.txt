the city of lodi  1272016   changes or modifications in accordance with health and safety 5 the adoption of amendments more restrictive than the requirements contained in the provisions published in the california building standard are needed because of local conditions as specified below a climatic 1 conditions precipitation averages 18 inches per year and can reach as high as 35 inches per year virtually all of the rain occurs during the months of october the remaining months receive little or no rain temperatures during the summer months can reach as high as 110 and city of lodi averages 19 days over 100 each year relative humidity during these summer months is very low lodi averages 34 days of dense fog per year and has had as many as 64 foggy days 2 impacts the generally dry hot summer months create extreme fire conditions adding to this situation is the dryness and combustibility of many structures during the summer especially true of structures with wood siding and roofs constructed of wood shakes and shingles the cyclical uncertainty that allow weather events can cause rapid melting of the snow pack which causes flood potential in areas surrounding the mokelumne river the foggy conditions can inhibit the dispatch and timeliness of emergency equipment reaching the site of a fire during foggy periods it is common place for visibility to be near zero which results in emergency equipment having to decrease their speed to less than 25 miles per hour b geographic 1 conditions the city of lodi is subject to ground tremors from seismic events as the county is in seismic category d the mokelumne river which borders the northern city limits is subjected to flood potential and its levies are subject to failure from seismic activity or high water 2 impacts the geologic conditions in san joaquin county in general and the city of lodi in particular have the potential of restricting access to structures especially in remote or isolated areas a moderate earthquake or extended periods of rain can impact local access roads c topographic 1 conditions the city of lodi consists mainly of the san joaquin valley floor the valley floor is typically flat land area bisected by intermittent and year round stream and river systems much of the valley floor is irrigated agriculture low land areas protected by a complex and extensive levee system characterize the delta area union pacific railroad tracks bisect the eastern and western portions of lodi as well as highway 99 creating traffic congestion and emergency response delays 2 impacts the valley floor is frequently subject to both general and localized flooding because the area is so flat and low it is not unusual for local drainage systems to be inadequate during heavy rain periods this condition can isolate areas where roads are flooded and thereby block access with the osha twoin twoout rule requiring two fire fighters ready to make attack only when two others are present the potential delay in eastwest response increases the risk to firefighter and the public while it is clearly understood that the adoption of such amendments may not prevent the incidence of fire the implementation of these various amendments to the code attempt to reduce the severity and potential loss of life property and protection of the environment  1272016 atc20 safety assessment placards intent this chapter

discharge c if subsections a and b of this section are satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of of this chapter  3172010 variance procedure   nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners the need to protect citizens from flooding is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate variances may not be granted that would permit fraud and victimization of the public or that would present a threat to public safety or create a nuisance  3172010   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of lodi need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city of lodi believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san joaquin county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  3172010   appeals the city council of the city of lodi shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter  3172010 development impact mitigation fees footnotes  10  editors note  adopted  repealed the former ch 1564   and enacted a new ch 1564 as set out herein the former ch 1564 pertained to development impact mitigation fees and derived from         adopted    findings and purpose the council finds and declares as follows a in order to implement the goals of the city of lodis general plan and to mitigate the impacts caused by new development in the city certain public improvements must be or had to be constructed the city council determines that development impact mitigation fees are needed to finance these public improvements and to pay for new developments fair share of the construction costs of these improvements in establishing the fees described in this chapter the city council finds the fees to be consistent with its general plan and pursuant to government 2 has considered the effects of the fees with respect to the citys housing needs as established in the housing element of the general plan b the purpose of this chapter is to implement the general plan requirements set forth in this subsection and subsection a of this section and to impose mitigation fees to fund the cost of certain facilities the demand for which is directly or indirectly generated by the type of new development proposed in the general plan under the authority of 1 the police power of the city granted under of the california constitution  2 the provisions of the california environmental quality act public resources et seq which in general requires that all developments mitigate environmental impacts  3 the provisions of the california government general plans at et seq including but not limited to the provisions of government  c it is further the purpose of this chapter to require that adequate provisions are made for developerfinanced facilities and services within the city limits as a condition to the approval of a new development d development impact mitigation fees are established on development in the city development impact mitigation fees shall consist of separate fees as described in this chapter the city council shall by resolution set forth the specific amount of the fees  describe the benefit and impact area on which the fee is imposed  refer to the specific improvements to be financed their estimated cost and reasonable relationship between this fee and the various types of new developments  and set forth time for payment adoption of such fee resolutions shall be done in compliance with government et seq e the specific improvements to be financed by the fee are described in the city of lodi impact mitigation fee program prepared for the city by harris and associates dated august 201 a copy of which is on file with the city clerk the calculation of the fee is based upon the findings in the referenced study f new development will generate new demand for facilities which must be accommodated by construction of new or expanded facilities the amount of demand generated and therefore the benefit gained varies according to kind of use therefore a dwelling unit equivalent due factor that quantifies the facilities demand of different land use types in terms of their equivalence to a low density residential unit a low density residential unit is assigned a due factor of 10 and the due factor for each of the other land use categories is determined based on the anticipated demand for each land use category relative to the anticipated demand for a low density residential unit g the city has previously approved various development projects which have made significant financial expenditures towards completion including the payment of the then current development impact mitigation fees  but have not obtained a building permit the city council finds and declares that such projects should be allowed to proceed without the imposition of new development impact mitigation fees imposed under this chapter  2202013   definitions a acreage means the gross acreage for fee calculation purposes of any property within the city general plan area not including the acreage of dedicated street rightofway existing prior to development except that the area of new dedicated street rightofway in excess of thirtyfour feet on one side of a street shall not be included in gross acreage b building permit means the permit issued or required for the construction improvement or remodeling of any structure pursuant to and as defined by the city building code c costs means amounts spent or authorized to be spent in connection with the planning financing acquisition and development of a facility including without limitation the costs of land construction engineering administration and consulting fees d development or project means any of the following 1 for water sewer storm drainage and electric impact fees any new connection to the city system or increase in service demand  2 for streets impact fees any project that increases traffic  3 for police fire parks and recreation art in public places and general city facilities impact fees any project generating new or increased service demand e facilities means those public facilities designated in the city of lodi impact mitigation fee program and as subsequently designated by the city council f land use means the planned use as shown on the general plan land use map g program fee per dwelling unit equivalent means the total program costs for a particular category of facility divided by the total number of dwelling unit equivalents and adjusted for price changes up to the year of construction and for the cost of financing as identified in the city of lodi development impact fee study or subsequent update for that particular category h dwelling unit equivalent due is the factor that quantifies the facilities demand of different land use types in terms of their equivalence to a low density residential unit a low density residential unit is assigned a due factor of 10 and the due factor for each of the other land use categories is determined based on the anticipated demand for each land use category relative to the anticipated demand for a low density residential unit  2202013

  purpose of design guidelines the design guidelines in this article are intended as a guide to assist property owners and project designers in understanding the citys goals for attaining high quality development that is sensitive to the citys unique character the guidelines will be used by staff and the site plan and architectural review committee sparc during the design review process and by the commission in the review of land use permit applications  2202013   applicability a the design guidelines in this article apply to all development within the city the design elements of each project including site design architecture landscaping signs parking design will be reviewed on a comprehensive basis b the review authority may interpret these design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific projects as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each project in some circumstances one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case the overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed  2202013   general design guidelines this section provides general design guidelines and principles that are applicable to all development within the city a consider adjacent development each development proposal should demonstrate consideration for the context of the proposed project on and off the site including the following 1 land uses and site organization of neighboring properties  2 the architectural style and building forms of neighboring structures  3 existing natural features ie mature trees etc  4 privacy on the site and neighboring properties  and 5 links to adjacent development using sidewalks and shared access drives and parking b landscaping 1 landscaped areas should be planned as an integral part of the overall project and not simply located in left over areas of the site 2 landscaping should be used to help define outdoor spaces soften a structures appearance and to screen parking loading storage and equipment areas 3 the use of onsite pedestrian amenities eg benches shelters drinking fountains lighting and trash receptacles is encouraged these elements should be provided in conjunction with onsite open spaces and be integrated into the site plan as primary features c exterior lighting exterior lighting should be designed to be compatible with the architectural and landscape design of the project 1 an appropriate hierarchy of lighting fixturesstructures and intensity should be considered when designing the lighting for the various elements of a project ie building and site entrances walkways parking areas or other areas of the site 2 the use of exterior lighting to accent a buildings architecture is encouraged all lighting fixtures should be properly shielded to eliminate light and glare from impacting adjacent properties and passing vehicles or pedestrians if neon tubing is used to illuminate portions of a building it should be concealed from view use of parapets cornices or ledges small portions of exposed neon tubing may be used to add a special effect to a buildings architecture but this must be well thought out and integrated into the overall design of the project 3 to achieve the desired lighting level for parking and pedestrian areas the use of more short low intensity fixtures is encouraged over the use of a few tall fixtures that illuminate large areas d screening 1 screening is a technique used to protect and separate uses and site functions from one another for the purpose of decreasing adverse noise wind or visual impacts and to provide privacy the need for screening should be considered early in the design process so that screening elements eg walls fences berms landscaping can be effectively integrated into the overall project design and not added later as an afterthought 2 the method of screening should be compatible with the adjacent structure in terms of overall design materials and color 3 where screening is required at the ground level a combination of elements should be considered including solid masonry walls wood fences berms and landscaping e refuse storage and equipment areas 1 refuse containers service areas loading docks and similar facilities should be located in areas out of view from the general public and so that their use does not interfere with onsite parking or circulation areas and adjacent uses especially residential uses figure 27  trash enclosure location 2 trash bins shall be fully enclosed enclosures should be screened with landscaping on their most visible sides recommended locations include inside parking courts or at the end of parking bays locations should be conveniently accessible for trash collection and maintenance and should not block access driveway during loading operations 3 trash storage areas that are visible from the upper stories of adjacent structures should have an opaque or semiopaque horizontal coverscreen to mitigate unsightly views the covering structure should be compatible with the sites architectural style 4 all screening facilities should be of adequate size for their intended purpose without dominating the site blocking sight distances or creating unnecessary barriers f general building design guidelines 1 compatibility with context new buildings should be in proportion to surrounding buildings except in those cases where current buildings are oversize harmony in mass lines and materials is important but monotony should be avoided buildings should be designed so that adverse impacts on adjacent buildings and properties are minimized loss of natural lighting shade trees noise pollution and exhaust fumes and heat from venting should be addressed during project review and all possible efforts should be made to avoid these effects 2 facade design building facades should be designed to provide visual interest and relief continuous street facades as near the street as possible with predominantly retail uses at grade and officeprofessional uses above are encouraged buildings should not be overpowering or monotonous a change in the planes of walls or variety in the roof form provides diversity and visual interest 3 building materials a artificial or decorative facade treatments where one or more unrelated materials appear to be simply applied to the surface of a building rather than an integral part of its design should be avoided materials should be used honestly artificial products that attempt to imitate real materials for example wood stone brick etc are discouraged b the composition of materials should avoid creating the impression of thinness and artificiality veneers should turn corners avoiding exposed edges figure 28  building material at wall edges c natural building materials eg wood stone and brick that blend with the natural surroundings should be used other materials should be reviewed on a casebycase basis buildings should minimize the use of large expanses of reflective glazing aluminum panels and other materials not normally found in lodi synthetic materials that attempt to simulate the textures or patterns of other materials eg vinyl siding that attempts to simulate the pattern of woodgrain should not be used 4 colors a colors should be compatible with the existing colors of the surrounding area but need not duplicate existing colors the use of muted tones for the structures base color is recommended color should not be used as an attention getting device b accent colors should be used carefully and be complementary to the base color or a variation of its hue either weaker or stronger c the transition between base and accent colors should relate to changes in building materials or the change of building surface planes colors should generally not meet or change without some physical change or definition to the surface plane d in most cases only one or two accent colors should be used in addition to the base color g subdivisions subdivisions of commercial industrial and multifamily residential properties should be designed to allow coordinated development of the parcels facilitate shared parking and common driveways reduce encroachments onto public and private streets and promote pedestrian activity  2202013 residential zoning districts   purpose of chapter this chapter lists the uses of land that may be allowed within the residential zoning districts established by zoning districts established it also

different time periods during which they were developed the guidelines provided here are intended to assist project designers and property owners in understanding and implementing the citys goals for attaining high quality residential development they are also intended to help preserve the traditional character of the citys older neighborhoods these guidelines are intended to encourage well designed residential neighborhoods that people enjoy living in which reduce the visual dominance of the automobile  promote pedestrian activity  create variety and interest in the appearance of residential streets  provide community open space  and protect significant features of the natural environment b applicability these guidelines apply to the design of new residential subdivisions and to multifamily and clustered residential projects guidelines are also provided for vacant infill parcels and singlefamily homes that are proposed as replacement structures within established neighborhoods see also applicability c subdivision design and general residential project principles the following guidelines apply to new residential subdivisions and address how new residential subdivisions should relate to their surroundings 1 develop neighborhoods each new residential project should be designed to integrate with the surrounding neighborhood to ensure that it maintains the established character subdivisions in city expansion areas should be designed so that individual separately developed projects work together to create distinct neighborhoods instead of disjointed or isolated enclaves 2 integrate open space new subdivisions adjacent to planned or existing parks or other public open spaces eg creeks riparian areas or the landscaped grounds of schools or other public facilities should maximize visibility and pedestrian access to these areas where these facilities are not already planned the subdivision should be designed to provide usable public open spaces in the form of parks linear bicycle and pedestrian trails squares and greens as appropriate 3 edges gated communities and other residential developments designed to appear as continuous walledoff areas disconnected and isolated from the rest of the community are strongly discouraged while walls and fences may be useful for security sound attenuation and privacy these objectives can often be met by creative design that controls the height and length of walls develops breaks and variations in relief and uses landscaping for screening 4 scale new residential subdivisions and groups of subdivisions that in effect collectively create a new neighborhood should be designed to provide a walkable scale that places all homes within onequarter mile of neighborhood shopping opportunities a neighborhood park or a public facility that can serve as a center for the neighborhood ideally each neighborhood should have a center that includes all three facilities 5 site planning residential subdivision and multifamily project site planning should emphasize the needs of pedestrians and cyclists rather than cars a street layout new public streets and sidewalks should be aligned with and be connected to those of adjacent developments to interconnect the community i pedestrian orientation subdivision design should emphasize pedestrian connectivity within each project to adjacent neighborhoods nearby schools and parks and to transit stops within onequartermile of planned residential areas all streets and walkways should be designed to provide safe and pleasant conditions for pedestrians including the disabled and cyclists ii block length the length of block faces between intersecting streets should be as short as possible ideally no more than four hundred feet to provide pedestrian connectivity iii street width and design speed streets within neighborhoods should be no wider than needed to accommodate parking and two lowspeed travel lanes streets in new subdivisions should be designed to accommodate traffic speeds of twentyfive miles per hour or less with most streets in a subdivision designed for lower speeds iv parkwayplanting strips sidewalks should be separated from curbs by parkway strips of at least five feet in width the parkways should be planted with canopy trees at a twentyfoot interval or as appropriate to the species of the selected street tree to produce a continuously shaded sidewalk the parkways should also be planted with ground covers and other plant materials that will withstand pedestrian traffic v access to open areas singleloaded streets those with residential development on one side and open space on the other should be used to provide public access to and visibility of natural open spaces public parks and neighborhood schools as well as a means for buffering homes from parks and schools where singleloaded streets are not feasible or desirable other methods that provide similar access and visibility may be used including private streets bike and pedestrian paths or the placement of private common open space or recreation facilities adjacent to the public open space vi culdesac streets the use of culdesac streets should be avoided wherever possible if culdesacs are necessary the end of each culdesac should provide a pedestrian walkway and bikeway between private parcels to link with an adjacent culdesac street andor park school or open space area vii alleys alleys may be provided for garage access otherwise individual lots should be wide enough to accommodate a side yard driveway to a detached garage at the rear of the lot so that appearance of the street frontage is not dominated by garages and pavement b open space and natural features providing open space and integrating natural features into a residential project can significantly increase the appreciation of residents in their neighborhoods provide safe places for children and families to play and maintain a strong sense of connection with the surrounding natural environment in the city as a whole i natural amenities such as views mature trees creeks riparian corridors and similar features should be preserved and incorporated into proposed development to the greatest extent feasible ii development adjacent to parks or other public open spaces should be designed to provide maximum visibility of these areas 6 exterior finish materials exterior finish materials should be durable and require low maintenance the use of combined materials such as stucco and wood siding can provide visual interest and texture  however all sides of each singlefamily dwelling or multifamily structure should employ the same materials design details and window treatment each residential structure should have a carefully designed and detailed facade facing the street and should not use bland featureless stucco or other simple materials on the other exterior building walls each residential structure should look like the same building from all sides 7 windows where one or more windows are proposed ten feet or less from a side lot line or within ten feet of another dwelling the windows should be located andor screened to provide privacy for the residents of both structures in some cases glass block or translucent glass may be appropriate to provide light but also provide privacy between buildings 8 garages and carports accommodating vehicle storage in both singlefamily dwellings and multifamily projects should avoid the common problem of creating streets that appear garage and drivewaydominated a in the limited instances where an exception is granted for a setback to a garage of less than twenty feet from a property line or internal driveway the garage shall be equipped with a rollup door this requirement is intended to discourage vehicles from parking in front of garages and blocking the adjacent driveway or sidewalk b where carports are provided they may be bordered by patio walls or used to define public and private open space but should not be located adjacent to perimeter streets each carport end should be screened by a low wall berm andor landscaping c where multiple garages are located together landscaped tree wells should be placed between every two garage doors each tree well should be a minimum of twentyfive square feet d carports and detached garages should be designed as an integral part of a project their materials color and details should be the same as the principal structures carports may have flat roofs but should not project above the exterior walls of any buildings adjacent to streets prefabricated metal or canvas tentlike carports are not acceptable where garages are utilized doors should appear set into walls rather than flush with the exterior wall e the use of quality materials windows and features with horizontal and vertical relief are encouraged to add interest and character to the design of garage doors and to coordinate their design with the architecture of the primary residence d infill development the following guidelines apply to infill development that is multifamily structures or individual houses that entirely replace existing units or are constructed on vacant parcels between existing units the guidelines are intended to provide for infill projects of high architectural quality that are compatible with existing development they are also intended to promote the conservation and reuse of existing older houses and to preserve the historical character of the citys older neighborhoods preservation and rehabilitation efforts in the older neighborhoods should protect the architectural features of a home that identify its individual style and contribute to the character of the area 1 general principles infill residential development should a be compatible in scale siting detailing and overall character with adjacent buildings and those in the immediate neighborhood this is crucial when a new or remodeled house is proposed to be larger than others in the neighborhood when new homes are developed adjacent to older ones the height and bulk of the new construction can have a negative impact on adjacent smaller scale buildings b continue existing neighborhood patterns for example patterns such as front porches and entries facing the street finished floor height and garages located at the rear of lots 2 building design an infill residential structure should incorporate the traditional architectural characteristics of existing houses in the neighborhood including window and door spacing exterior materials roof style and pitch ornamentation and other details 3 visual impacts from building height the height of infill projects should be consistent with surrounding residential structures where greater height is desired an infill structure should set back upper floors from the edge of the first story to reduce impacts on adjacent smaller homes and to protect solar access see figure 29 figure 29  appropriate infill building massing 4 outdoor living areas the use of balconies verandas porches and courtyards within the building form of infill structures is strongly encouraged 5 exterior finish materials the thoughtful selection of building materials can enhance desired neighborhood qualities such as compatibility continuity and harmony the design of infill residential structures should incorporate an appropriate mixture of the predominant materials found in the neighborhood common materials in lodi are smooth troweled or sandfinished stucco wood horizontal clapboard siding brick and stone 6 exterior colors color schemes for infill residential structures should consider the colors of existing houses in the neighborhood to maintain compatibility e singlefamily housing design including additionsrenovations 1 houses in new subdivisions the site planning of lots and the design of houses constructed in new subdivisions should help create neighborhoods that are oriented more toward pedestrians than automobiles subdivisions of new homes should comply with the following guidelines a subdivisions should provide variety in the architectural detailing size and massing of houses on each block b houses should be located no further from the street than the minimum setback allowed by the applicable zoning district except to provide variations in the alignment of houses along a block c all houses should have their primary entrance facing and clearly visible from the street with a front porch or verandah encouraged to provide a transition between the public space of the streetscape and the indoor private space of the house d when viewed from the street a garage should be visually subordinate to the living space within the house that addresses the street ideally a garage should be detached from the house located at the rear of the lot and accessed by an alley or a shared driveway from the street fronting the lot where this arrangement is not appropriate the front of an attached garage should be set back from the front of the house at least fifteen feet is recommended where the lot area permits 2 infill development new singlefamily homes proposed on infill lots should comply with the guidelines for infill residential development in d infill development 3 additions and alterations in older neighborhoods the following guidelines apply to additions and the rehabilitation remodeling or alteration of existing singlefamily houses in lodis older neighborhoods while these guidelines apply to all houses those that are designated as cultural resources may be subject to more strict standards a additions additions to residential structures built before 1950 should respect the architectural style detailing scale and composition of the original building so that they look integrated with the original structure rather than a tackedon afterthought modifications eg additions seismic strengthening replacement of windows or siding material and new entrances should not compromise the integrity of historically authentic features materials or finishes additions should also be designed with consideration for the design and massing of adjacent residences to promote neighborhood compatibility see figure 210 figure 210  additions to existing homes i roof changes the roof features of a residential structure especially its style materials and pitch are important architectural elements that must be considered when planning an addition the roof style pitch and materials on the addition should match the original ii additional floors adding a story to an existing house will change the building proportions and should be carefully designed to follow similar multistory examples of the particular architectural style found in the neighborhood in some cases integrating the new story addition may require that it be set back or stepped back from the front facade so that it is less noticeable from the street b alterationsrestoration and remodeling the rehabilitation of older buildings should aim to retain and restore their original elements if damage or deterioration is too severe the element should be recreated using original materials to match the design color texture and any other important design features see figure 211 figure 211  remodeling features when replacement is necessary and materials similar to or consistent with original materials cannot be obtained substitute materials should incorporate design colors and textures that convey the traditional appearance of the original material c exterior materials original exterior building materials should be retained whenever possible mismatched materials of different sizes shapes textures or finishes should be avoided i wood siding residential buildings with original wood clapboard siding should not be stuccoed in an attempt to modernize their appearance ii brick surfaces brick surfaces should not be sandblasted to remove old paint nor should they be covered with stucco or other siding materials sandblasting will damage the natural fired surface of the brick and cause it to lose its water repellent qualities paint should be removed by chemical stripping brick that was not intended to be painted as part of a buildings original design should not be painted over d windows most older residential structures have woodframed windows that are either fixed double hung or casement window replacements or additions should also use the original type of window it is strongly recommended that aluminum frame windows not be used as replacements in any residential structure unless they were part of the original design see figure 212 figure 212  window types and treatments e doors many of lodis older homes have solid wood doors consistent with the particular architectural style of the building the front door is typically the most ornate with secondary doors usually more utilitarian in appearance the size shape and style of doors is an important feature of all historical architectural styles and the original type and design should continue to be used see figure 213 figure 213  door features if the original door is missing an appropriate design should be selected study of the doors of similar residential structures in the neighborhood or by consulting books on architectural styles some olderstyle panel doors can be obtained from material suppliers and may closely match original doors f porches and stairs during rehabilitation efforts the design integrity of the front porch should be maintained the installation of wrought iron or aluminum railings should be avoided as a change in the structural or decorative elements of the front porch will usually compromise the architectural integrity of the entire building restoring an older buildings architectural integrity may require undoing previous porch alterations see figures 214 and 215 figure 214  appropriate porch stairway designs figure 215  inappropriate porch stairway designs g ornamentation and trim the authentic decoration and trim of a residential structure lends character and identifies the building with a particular architectural style care should be taken in handling these materials during renovation because they are critical components h roofs care should be taken to ensure that roofing materials are compatible with the original style of the structure f multifamily and clustered housing design multifamily and clustered housing projects are generally more dense than singlefamily developments and tend to generate larger parking areas and provide less private open space if not properly designed parking can dominate a site and open space may only be provided as left over areas unrelated to other project features not usable for outdoor activities and that expose residents to uncomfortable noise levels multifamily projects surrounded by high walls parking lots andor rows of carports along streets are inappropriate in lodi and should be avoided these guidelines address higher density developments guidelines for site planning parking and circulation layout building design and landscaping 1 site planning site planning for a multifamily or clustered housing project should create a pleasant comfortable safe and distinct place for residents without the project turning its back on the surrounding neighborhood a the placement of new units should consider the existing character of the surrounding residential area new development should respect the privacy of adjacent residential uses building orientation and structure height so that windows do not overlook and impair the privacy of the indoor or outdoor living space of adjacent units b multifamily units should be clustered a project of more than ten units outside the downtown should separate the units into structures of six or fewer units see figure 216 figure 216  clustered multifamily units c multifamily structures should be set back from adjacent public streets consistent with the prevailing setback pattern of the immediate neighborhood d multifamily projects with densities less than thirty units per acre should be comprised of walkup rather than stacked units with each unit adjacent to a street having its primary pedestrian entrance from the street sidewalk higher density projects should be designed either with ground floor units having individual sidewalk entrances or as courtyard projects with at least one significant pedestrian entrance from the street sidewalk where individual units have access to the street sidewalk private front yard outdoor space may be differentiated from the public rightofway by a porch or small yard enclosed by a low fence see figures 217 and 218 figure 217  most ground floor units should have entrances facing the street e residential units and activity areas not adjacent to a street should be accessible via pedestrian walkways and bikeways separate from vehicle parking areas and driveways see figure 218 figure 218  walkways separate from vehicle access 2 parking and driveways individual closeable garages are the preferred method for providing parking for residents in multifamily projects if garages within the residential structures are not provided dispersed parking courts are acceptable a long monotonous parking drives and large undivided parking lots are discouraged b the main vehicle access into a multifamily site should be attractive entry drive colored and textured paving treatment is encouraged outside of the public street rightofway and within the project c parking areas should be visible from the residential units to the extent possible d safe and protected bicycle parking should be located convenient to each dwelling unit e parking courts with or without carports should not consist of more than two doubleloaded parking aisles bays adjacent to each other the length of a parking court should not exceed the width of eight adjoining stalls f parking courts should be separated from each other by buildings within the project or by landscape or natural open space areas at least thirty feet wide g large scale multifamily projects ie more than twenty units with internal streets should have the streets designed as if they were pleasant public streets with comprehensive streetscapes including sidewalks and planting strips between curb and sidewalk with canopy trees h private storage cabinets shall be provided in all car ports 3 multifamily project architecture the exterior design of multifamily projects should be derived from architectural styles in the surrounding neighborhood often these types of projects are adjacent to single family neighborhoods and care in design should ensure that the height and bulk of the higher density projects do not impact adjacent lower density residential areas a facade and roof articulation a structure with three or more attached units should incorporate significant wall and roof articulation to reduce apparent scale changes in wall planes and roof heights and the inclusion of elements such as balconies porches arcades dormers and cross gables can avoid the barrackslike quality of long flat walls and roofs secondary hipped or gabled roofs covering the entire mass of a building are preferable to mansard roofs or segments of pitched roof applied at the structures edge structures including garages and carports exceeding one hundred fifty feet in length are discouraged see figures 217 and 219 b scale because multifamily projects are usually taller than one story their bulk can impose on surrounding uses the larger scale of these projects should be considered within the context of their surroundings structures with greater height may require additional setbacks at the ground floor level andor upper levels steppeddown along the street frontage so they do not shade adjacent properties or visually dominate the neighborhood large projects should be broken up into groups of structures and large single structures should be avoided see figure 219 c balconies porches and patios the use of balconies porches and patios as part of multifamily structures is encouraged for both practical and aesthetic value these elements should be used to break up large wall masses offset floor setbacks and add human scale to structures multifamily units with individual access to the street sidewalk should have individual covered porches see figure 219 figure 219 d dwelling unit access the use of balconies and corridors to provide access to five or more units should be avoided access points to units should instead be clustered in groups of four or less to the extent possible main entrances to individual units should be from adjoining streets distinctive architectural elements and materials should be used to highlight primary entrances e exterior stairways stairways providing access to the upper levels of multifamily structures should be located mostly within the buildings themselves where exterior stairways are necessary they should provide residents and visitors protection from weather and should be of stucco plaster or wood with accent trim to match the main structure thinlooking open metal prefabricated stairs that are not integrated with the design of the structure are discouraged f accessory structures accessory structures should be designed as an integral part of a project their materials color and details should be the same as the principal structures on the site  2202013 commercial zoning districts   purpose of

2202013   commercial design guidelines a purpose the commercial design guidelines in this chapter are intended to assist in preserving and rehabilitating the commercial areas of lodi the guidelines are also intended to provide for infill commercial development of high architectural quality that is compatible with existing architecturally superior development to promote the conservation and reuse of existing buildings of high quality design while these guidelines are primarily oriented toward the downtown area they are also designed to enhance and preserve the small town character of the citys other commercial areas b applicability see applicability of design guidelines c site planning outside of the downtown 1 building and parking location a general placement principles buildings should generally be oriented parallel to streets and placed as close to the street as required setbacks permit buildings may be angled to create interesting juxtapositions if there is a specific design goal to be achieved however definition of the street edge is an important role for buildings that should be considered in design exceptions may occur for wider setbacks from the street if a compatible use is proposed for example outdoor dining or pedestrian rest area or to maintain continuity with landscaped areas on adjacent properties figure 220  building placement of street b pedestrian orientation the orientation of buildings should establish and maintain pedestrianoriented street frontages buildings with high pedestrian use should face and be directly accessible from the public sidewalk c vehicleoriented areas buildings in areas of the city that rely more on the use of the automobile for access should be oriented to major open space and streetscape elements and as much as possible should not be located behind parking lots located between the building and the street d corner buildings corner buildings should have a strong tie to the setback lines of each street the primary mass of the building should not be placed at an angle to the corner this does not preclude angled building corners or an open plaza at the corner which are strongly encouraged e projects with multiple structures multiple buildings in a single project should create a positive functional relationship with one another and the street the first priority for multiplebuilding projects is to address the street with features that provide pedestrian interest and facilitate access to the project second buildings should be clustered to achieve a village scale this creates opportunities for internal plazas and pedestrian areas when clustering is impractical a visual link should be established between buildings this link can be accomplished use of an arcade system trellis colonnade and paving figure 221  location of parking and buildings f open space areas open space areas should be accessible from the majority of structures and should be oriented to take advantage of sun or shade as appropriate g pedestrian walkways projects should connect the onsite pedestrian circulation system to the offsite public sidewalk at intervals of at least one connection for each two hundred linear feet or fraction thereof parking areas should be connected to building entrances by means of enhanced paving patterned or stamped 2 building orientation the organization and orientation of commercial buildings and spaces is crucial in creating streets that are welcoming and friendly to pedestrians active public spaces and city streets that are heavily used by pedestrians contribute to the character and economic vitality of the city high levels of pedestrian activity  shopping eating people watching exercising strolling relaxing walking from place to place  are valued and encouraged throughout the citys commercial areas these activities create interest provide a sense of safety on the street and add to community image and identity the following guidelines provide a framework for site organization and orientation of commercial land uses a street orientation i building facades including storefronts should be designed to orient to the major street frontage with the primary building entry also oriented toward the major street ii buildings on corners should include storefront design features for at least fifty percent of the wall area on the side street elevation iii long blank unarticulated street wall facades are strongly discouraged unless unavoidable because of specific site circumstances monolithic street wall facades should be broken by vertical and horizontal articulation characterized by a sculpted carved or penetrated wall surfaces defined by recesses and reveals  b breaks reveals recesses  c window and door openings  or d balconies awnings and canopies figure 222  storefront proportions iv large unbroken facade surfaces should be avoided at the storefront level this can be achieved in a number of ways including a dividing the facade into a series of display windows with smaller panes of glass  b constructing the facade with small human scale materials such as brick or decorative tile along bulkheads  c providing traditional recessed entries  d careful sizing placement and overall design of signage  and e providing consistent door and window reveals b street edge i the first floor of any infill commercial building should be built directly at the front property line c abutting the sidewalk c unless minor variations are permitted by the city for plazas public art or other pedestrianoriented purpose figure 223  placement of infill buildings ii awnings trellises and other accessory structures that are relatively open and do not restrict pedestrian or vehicular movement may project over the rightofway with city approval figure 224  awnings provide pedestrian scale and comfort iii any building located at a corner intersection should incorporate architectural features at the ground floor which emphasize the importance of pedestrian movement these features may include building cutoffs walkarcades trellis structures and other elements which focus visual interest on the corners figure 225  desirable design features for street corner buildings c public spaces public space associated with commercial buildings should serve as a transition from the outside to the inside of buildings and should be supportive of pedestrian activity public areas should be designed so that all members of the public fee that they may enter and should be designed as extensions of the public space of the sidewalk eg by providing pedestrian amenities such as benches and fountains and by continuing the hardscape of the sidewalk i plazas a plazas should be designed to supplement rather than replace onstreet activity areas paving and furniture used in private plazas should complement streetscape elements used in the public rightofway b retail shops restaurants offices or other activitygenerating uses should be located at the edges of plazas  blank walls should be minimized adjacent to pedestrian spaces c plazas should be designed with unimpeded linesofsight to and from the public sidewalk security fences walls and entry gates shall not block the sidewalk edge of the plaza or views into the plaza at least fifteen feet of building frontage should be transparent or visually penetrable to provide entry to and views into the plaza d entries to a plaza and storefront entries within the plaza should be designed and lit so they do not create hiding places e visual features such as public art or a fountain should be incorporated in plazas to attract pedestrians f seating should be provided at a ratio of at least one seating area for each one hundred square feet of plaza in addition to any outdoor dining areas g plazas including all entrances and exits should be fully illuminated onehalf hour after sunset to onehalf hour before sunrise to facilitate natural surveillance opportunities and to discourage illegitimate activities lighting should be designed to help define order and further develop the design concept of the space in a manner that appears welcoming to pedestrians h signs or other mechanisms should identify that the plaza is available for public use during business hours i security gates and security fencing may not be used in plazas except as may be permitted by the review authority when granting the land use permit for the project based on a determination that unusual circumstances justify their use ii entry courtyards where used courtyards should a include focal elements of sculpture water plantings and seating niches b be provided trees that are drought tolerant and planted in symmetric patterns c be designed to provide both visibility and separation from the street d building design and architecture the visual relationships between individual commercial buildings contribute to community identity levels of pedestrian activity and economic vitality when the architectural features for example entry spacing window lines and signs of commercial buildings are complementary the larger district image becomes more positive and unified building facades in particular influence cohesiveness legibility and aesthetic pride likewise storefront design can encourage shopping increase a sense of security and generate pedestrian activity where commercial buildings are neighbors to residential buildings consideration of scale detail and materials are even more important 1 mass and scale building scale and massing contributes to the unique character and pedestrianorientation of the downtown and some of the other commercial areas of lodi smallerscale buildings or buildings perceived to be of smallscale are most suitable to creating the atmosphere desired in the city humanscale buildings are comfortable and create a friendly atmosphere that enhances the marketability of commercial areas to this end buildings and their parts should impart a sense of human scale and assume a reinforcing relationship with the sidewalk street and pedestrian activity the relationship of the building elements to the overall building should create a clear set of meaningful relationships between the building and the elements and the elements to each other the elements of the building should not appear as random or unrelated to each other the height and scale of infill development and alterations to existing development within commercial areas should complement existing structures while providing a sense of human scale and proportion infill structures should be designed to provide storefront windows doors entries transoms awnings cornice treatments and other architectural features designed to complement existing structures without duplicating a particular architectural style specific guidelines related to the mass and scale of building architecture are as follows a general design principles i the characteristic proportion relationship of height to width of existing facades should be considered in relation to infill development alterations and additions figure 226  infill facade proportions ii whenever an infill building is proposed which is much wider than the existing characteristic facades on the street the infill facades should be broken down into a series of appropriately proportioned structural bays or components typically segmented by a series of columns or masonry piers which frame window door and bulkhead components creating and reinforcing a facade rhythm helps tie the commercial street together visually and provides the pedestrian with a standard measurement of his or her progress figure 227  infill structure facade divided into bays iii the commercial buildings in lodi are generally in the one to threestory range infill buildings or upper story additions to existing buildings should not be much higher or lower than the height of surrounding structures figure 228  infill consistent with context b building proportions i maintain a clear visual distinction between upper story openings and street level storefront openings windows and doors there should usually be more window area at the storefront level to provide greater interior visibility for pedestrians as opposed to upper stories with smaller window openings figure 229  new storefront proportions consistent with context ii whenever an infill building is proposed between two adjacent commercial structures the characteristic rhythm proportion and spacing of existing door and window openings should be maintained c horizontal rhythmsalignment of architectural elements i when an infill building is proposed the common horizontal elements eg cornice line window heightwidth and spacing of neighboring structures should be identified and the infill should have similar rhythm or alignment ii if maintaining a horizontal rhythm or alignment in an infill building is very difficult or otherwise impossible the use of fabric canopies or awnings is encouraged to establish a shared horizontal storefront rhythm d architectural features i features such as balconies open and enclosed turrets finials and bay windows that help give human scale and interest to buildings are encouraged ii decorative ornamentation the decorative use of color and integral color materials and architectural composition that employs abstract or representational ornament to help order the facade or emphasize the relative importance of different building elements are encouraged 2 architectural elementsmaterials the types of materials and architectural elements incorporated into commercial buildings contribute to visual interest community image business identity and architectural quality the following guidelines provide a framework for creating a cohesive commercial character while providing flexibility and promoting unique architectural features a entries and doorways i main building entries should emphasize the point of arrival in one or more of the following ways a placement of art or decorative detailing  b a turret or balcony over the entrance  c change of material or detailing  d greater concentration of ornaments  e flanked columns decorative fixtures or other details  f recesses within a larger arched or cased decorative opening  g a portico formal porch projecting from or set into the building face  h changes in roofline a tower or a break in the surface of the subject wall  i architectural features above it ii street corner commercial buildings should provide a prominent entrance to street level shops or lobby space at or near the corner figure 230  prominent corner entrance b doors and windows i retail store doorways should contain a high percentage of glass to allow pedestrians to see the retail contents and activities in stores figure 231  maintain extensive storefront glass area ii when windows are added or changed it is important that the design be compatible with the facade theme of the block streetscape iii use clear glass at least eightyeight percent light transmission in first floor windows iv storefront windows should be as large as possible and no closer than eighteen inches from the ground bulkhead height by limiting the bulkhead height the visibility to the storefront displays and retail interior is maximized maximum bulkhead heights for infill construction should be seventeen inches figure 232  storefront components v introducing or changing the location or size of windows or other openings that alter the architectural rhythm or character of the original building is discouraged vi permanent fixed security grates or grilles in front of windows are not permitted any necessary security grilles should be placed inside behind the window display area vii traditional storefront transom windows should be retained whenever feasible if the ceiling inside the structure has been lowered the ceiling should be stepped up to meet the transom so that light will penetrate the interior of the building figure 233  transom windows c awnings and canopies i where the facade of a commercial building is divided into distinct structural bays sections defined by vertical architectural elements such as masonry piers awnings should be placed within the vertical elements rather than overlapping them the awning design should respond to the scale proportion and rhythm created by these structural bay elements and nestle into the space created by the structural bay figure 234  appropriate and inappropriate awning forms ii awning shape should relate to the window or door opening barrelshaped awnings should be used to complement arched windows while square awnings should be used on rectangular windows iii awnings shall not be internally illuminated d grillworkmetalwork and other details there are a number of details often thought of as mundane which may be incorporated into the design to add a degree of visual richness and interest while meeting functional needs these details include the following i light fixtures wall mounted or hung with decorative metal brackets ii metal grillwork at vent openings or as decorative features at windows doorways or gates iii decorative scuppers catches and downspouts preferably of copper iv balconies rails finials corbels plaques etc v flag or banner pole brackets figure 235  metalwork design elements e exterior walls and materials the exterior wall design elements of commercial buildings involve two aspects c color and texture materials with integral color such as hard smooth troweled plaster tile and stone is encouraged if the buildings exterior design is complicated with many design features the wall texture should be simple and subdued however if the building design is simple perhaps more monolithic a finely textured material such as patterned masonry can greatly enrich the buildings overall character storefront materials should complement the materials used on significant adjacent buildings the following materials are considered appropriate for commercial buildings within lodi the number of different wall materials used on any one building should be kept to a minimum ideally two or less  clear glass   glass block transom   exterior plaster smooth trowelled preferred   new or used facebrick   cut stone rusticated block cast stone   ceramic tiles bulkhead   clapboard where appropriate  the following exterior building materials are considered inappropriate in lodi commercial areas and are discouraged  mirror glass and heavily tinted glass   windows with false divisions ie a window where the glass continues uninterrupted behind a surface mounted mullion   vinyl and aluminum siding   painted or baked enamel metal awnings   rough spanish lace stucco finish   unpainted plywood   false stone veneer   bulky cast stone window and door surrounds   corrugated sheet metal   corrugated fiberglass   split face concrete block   exposed concrete block without integral color f lighting i lighting should be designed as an integral part of the overall site and building design it should contribute to and help define the character and the spaces created by the building and its site development lighting design should have a conscious purpose of helping to strengthen the constituent elements of the site such as highlighting areas that are more important or by picking out areas of the site that have a different character from the rest of the site lighting should complement architectural elements changes in material of the ground plane and landscaping the intensity color placement of the light and the placement and design of the light fixtures should be part of this effort ii lighting should provide illumination for the security and safety of onsite areas such as entrances exits parking loading pathways and working areas iii lighting should be provided for the pedestrian to create a sense of welcoming on the public sidewalk that the pedestrian is literally being accompanied by light providing a greater number of softer light sources is strongly encouraged over having only a few very bright lights iv the design of light fixtures and their structural supports should be architecturally compatible with the main buildings on the site fixtures should be integrated within the architectural design for the buildings v as a security device lighting should be adequate but not overly bright building entrances should be well lighted the lighting should be designed so that the lighting is an attractive element in its own right acting as a public amenity vi all lighting should be shielded to confine light spread within the site boundaries and not spill onto adjacent properties lighting should be provided from onehalf hour after sunset to onehalf hour before sunrise at all exits entrances loading areas parking lots plazas and alleys an average of one foot candle evenly distributed across the site is a suggested minimum  with up to twofoot candles at entrances exits and loading areas vii the following lighting fixtures and lamps are considered inappropriate in lodi commercial areas and are discouraged  mercury vapor lights metal halide or highpressure sodium lamps are preferable for most applications   fluorescent light tubes that are exposed without filtering lenses   fluorescent lamps without noncolor corrected bulbs color correction may also be accomplished by a colorcorrecting lens   the development code prohibits flashing or blinking lights viii focus light downward a good rule of thumb is to make sure that direct light shines a minimum of twenty degrees below a horizontal plane and in no case above the horizontal plane ix test installations for glare after installation check to make sure that glare will not be a problem for neighbors pedestrians or motorists x illuminate signs and billboards from above not below xi avoid reflective surfaces beneath downlit signs xii all lighting shall be maintained in working order and in appearance g rear entrances rear entrance design should consider a number of issues in general the rear entrance must respond to the same needs as the storefront but at a reduced scale it must also meet the functional service needs of the business including providing a loading area since these two functions are often in conflict the design of the rear entrance must be carefully planned a particular concern is the storage and disposal of refuse all trash cans dumpsters and other containers must be hidden and screened from public view as required by the development code exterior utilities must be screened regular maintenance is of paramount importance the design of a rear entrance should be appropriate to its surroundings the visual character of rear facades alleys and parking lots is relatively casual and utilitarian especially when compared to formal street facades in this context a refined or grand design can look out of place the design should instead be pleasantly inviting and architecturally compatible with the front but very simple in detail figure 236  rear entrances should be aesthetically simple and utilitarian i an awning can soften a rear facade and provide a pleasant protected space ii the rear entry door should be wood and glass similar to the front door special security glass ie wire imbedded is allowed iii security lighting should be modest and should focus on the rear entry door iv selective use of tree plantings potted plants and other landscaping can subtly improve a rear facade v refuse containers and service facilities must be screened from view by solid walls the use of landscaping shrubs and vines to screen walls can help deter graffiti 3 alterationsrestoration and remodeling renovating or remodeling commercial structures provides an excellent means of maintaining and reinforcing the character and image desired in lodi renovation and expansion not only increases property values in the area but also serves as an inspiration to other property owners and designers to make similar efforts when an existing structure is to be renovated or added to the work should respect the original design character of the structure the following design guidelines apply where appropriate and whenever a structure is to be renovated or expanded a traditional features and decoration i sensitive response to existing materials details proportions as well as patterns of materials and openings is required when any such work will affect the appearance of an existing buildings exterior ii storefront remodeling often retains original decorative details only as visual leftovers or simply covers them if a building is to be refurbished these forgotten details should not be wasted if enough of them remain they can be restored as part of the original design if only a few remain they can be incorporated as design features in a new storefront in either case the design of any improvements should grow out of the remaining traditional details and create a harmonious background which emphasizes them b removal of elements inconsistent with original facade existing building elements incompatible with the original facade design should be removed these include excessive use of exterior embellishments and modernized elements metal grilles oversized molding cornices or rusticated materials etc buildings are often altered over time by owners or shopkeepers to keep up with changing times or to remake a tired image unfortunately such changes are often done in a tackedon manner and result in gradual but severe erosion of original character and cohesion of the commercial area c storefront renovation i where the original storefront remains little or no remodeling has occurred it should be preserved and repaired with as little alteration as possible ii where only part of the original storefront remains limited remodeling has occurred the storefront should be repaired maintaining historic materials where possible including the replacement of extensively deteriorated or missing parts with new parts based upon surviving examples of transoms bulkheads pilasters signs etc figure 237 iii where the original storefront is completely missing extensive remodeling has occurred the first priority is to reconstruct the storefront based upon historical pictorial and physical documentation if that is not practical the design of the new storefront should be compatible with the size scale proportion material and color of the existing structure d window replacement i the impact of windows on the facade is determined by the size shape pattern of openings spacing and placement within the facade when altering or reconstructing windows consideration of these elements is crucial to retaining the structures original architectural balance and integrity ii wherever possible retain original window openings if the existing ceiling has been lowered pull the dropped ceiling back from the original window iii if possible save and restore original windows and frames replace missing rotting or broken sash frames mullions and muntins with similar material iv if original window openings have been altered restore the openings to their original configuration and detail avoid blocking or filling window openings that contribute to the overall facade design v when replacing windows consideration should be given to the original size and shape detailing and framing materials replacement windows should be the same operating type as the original window figure 238  window replacement e door replacement i original doors and door hardware should be retained repaired and refinished provided they can comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act ada ii if replacement doors are necessary they should be compatible with the historical character and design of the structure f additions to existing structures i the design of a proposed addition should follow the general scale proportion massing and detailing of the original structure and should result in a harmoniousrather than starkcontrast ii additions should be interpretations of the existing buildings with the main characteristics of the existing structure incorporated using modern construction methods this may include the extension of architectural lines from the existing structure to the addition  repetition of window and entrance spacing  use of harmonizing colors and materials  and the inclusion of similar yet distinct architectural details ie window and door trim lighting fixtures tile or brick decoration etc iii additions should be designed so that if the addition were to be removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the original structure would be unimpaired g seismic retrofitting where structural improvements for seismic retrofitting affect the building exterior such improvements should be done with care and consideration for the impact on appearance of the building where possible such work should be concealed where this is not possible the improvements should be planned to carefully integrate into the existing building design 4 equipment and utilities a all mechanical or utility equipment whether on the roof ground or side of building must be screened from view above or below the method of screening should be architecturally integrated with the structure in terms of materials color shape and size the design of the screening should be done in concert with and as a part of the design of the building rather than as an afterthought b roof mounted mechanical or utility equipment must be screened the method of screening should be architecturally integrated with the structure in terms of materials color shape and size it is preferable to screen equipment with solid building elements eg parapet wall instead of afterthefact addon screening eg wood or metal slats c air conditioning units placed in individual windows and window transom areas are strongly discouraged figure 238  equipment screening e security safety in commercial areas is important to business owners workers and visitors and to the overall economic wellbeing of businesses design strategies incorporating safety should be based on the practice called crime prevention through environmental design or cpted pronounced septed cpted focuses on the proper design and use of the built environment to enhance opportunities for positive constructive activities while minimizing opportunities for illegitimate or undesirable activities cpted is a measure for proactive and retrofit crime prevention planning one that can help reduce the incidence and fear of crime and improve overall quality of life by no means is cpted a panacea in the efforts to rid communities of crime  however it is one strategy among others that should be considered in commercial development there are five principles used in the application of cpted natural surveillance natural access control territorial reinforcement and management and maintenance 1 natural surveillance the organization of physical features activities and people in such a way as to maximize visibility that is a space should be designed so that users feel that they will be seen or observed if they do something illegitimate the placement of windows doors and plazas the alignment of sidewalks and paths the minimization of large areas of blank walls the locations and levels of lighting and the proper design and size of open spaces can contribute to natural surveillance opportunities 2 natural access control the physical guidance of people coming and going from a space by the judicial placement of entrances exits signs fencing landscaping and lighting a space should be designed so that it is conducive to the activities undertaken by legitimate lawabiding users but discouraging to those carrying out undesirable activities 3 territorial reinforcement the use of physical attributes that express ownership such as fences pavement treatments art signage and landscaping cpted stresses the importance of clearly designing a hierarchy of spaces public ie intended for all to use semiprivate ie intended for specific users or uses private ie intended for private use by businesses 4 management and maintenance the continued use of a space for its intended purpose which serves as an additional expression of ownership eg complying with landscape maintenance and lighting standards to ensure that visibility is not reduced although the physical dimensions of cpted are important no effort is sustained unless it is properly maintained and operated 5 design considerations the following design considerations as well as many of the preceding guidelines incorporate cpted principles and should be considered for new commercial development in lodi a window materials storefront security may be enhanced with shatterresistant laminated vigil pane security glass or glassclad polycarbonate windows b security screens the use of exterior scissorsstyle security screens is strongly discouraged any use of interior scissors screens shall be concealed from public view when not in use by retracting the screen into casings which are in proportion and scale with the building architecture however although they are allowed the use of interior scissors screens is strongly discouraged since they communicate a message of high crime and cannot be integrated visually into the overall design of a building or storefront figure 239  security screen placement c security bars permanent security bars those clearly visible and fixed to windows or the facade and exterior rollup metal security doors are strongly discouraged d lighting placement exterior lights that are a part of streetscape improvements should provide adequate lighting levels however in the case of a deep threshold to a building a light applied to the ceiling of this area is strongly recommended to illuminate building entrances e lighting design lighting should be designed to satisfy both functional and decorative needs storefront lighting should complement the architectural style of the building while providing illumination of building facades and entrances f rear security lighting rear security lighting should be provided and maintained at twelvefoot candles per square foot the level of lighting should be measured at ground level all security lighting should be designed as part of an overall lighting plan rather than as single standalone elements g window signs any window signs should be placed to provide a clear and unobstructed view of the interior of the business establishment from the sidewalk and are not permitted by this development code to exceed twenty percent of the window area h street addresses street addresses should be identified by posting numbers so they are clearly visible from the public rightofway wherever possible figure 240  street addresses should help easy identification i safety behind buildings safety behind buildings should be ensured of i adequate security lighting for parking areas and pedestrian ways  ii limited access walls fences gates shrubs  iii signage  iv introduction of activities eg rear entrances for commercial activities that increase surveillance  v surveillance or with cameras  and vi ongoing maintenance of storage areas and alleys f walls and fences if walls or fences are not required for a specific screening or security purpose they should not be used any necessary walls or fences should be as low as possible while still performing their screening and security functions 1 materials and colors fences and walls should be designed with materials and colors that complement project architecture when selecting wood as a material it is important to consider its increased maintenance demands landscaping should be used in combination with walls whenever possible 2 design long expanses of wall or fence surfaces should be offset and architecturally designed to prevent monotony landscape pockets should be provided along the wall 3 security fencing when required security fencing should be a combination of solid pillars or short solid wall segments and wrought iron grille work  2202013 mixed use zoning districts   purpose of chapter this chapter lists the uses of land that may be allowed within the mixed use zoning districts established by zoning districts established determines the type of land use permitapproval required for each use and provides basic standards

component to the revitalization strategy adopted for the downtown area was to create and establish land use policies and design guidelines that build on the existing palette of architectural forms and building materials a primary purpose of the downtown mixed use design guidelines is to ensure that high quality design is maintained for all new construction and rehabilitation projects within the district the guidelines are intended to encourage individual creativity of project designers while respecting the needs of the individual owner and user the guidelines are intended to create a distinctive and cohesive image for downtown lodi  assure that all new development rehabilitation and improvements give consideration to quality design in architecture and site planning  protect and enhance property values and investment  and provide consistency and compatibility within the downtown the development standards and design guidelines promote buildings and renovations that strengthen the existing main street character of the downtown area and enhance a pedestrianoriented retail and entertainment niche among other things they require buildings to help shape the street as a pedestrian space b applicability 1 the downtown mixed use design guidelines shall apply to all of the properties designated as downtown mixed use in the general plan the design elements of each project including site design architecture landscaping signs parking design will be reviewed on a comprehensive basis 2 the downtown mixed use guidelines augment other sections of the development code when an issue condition or situation occurs which is not covered or provided for in the design guidelines the regulations of the development code that are most applicable to the issue conditions or situation shall apply in the event that the provisions of the design guidelines are in conflict with other sections of the development codes the provisions of the design guidelines shall prevail c development standards development standards address those aspects that are essential to achieve the goals of the concept plan they are specifications for building design and site development such as height setbacks and permitted uses standards are required minimums or benchmarks that all projects must adhere to 1 land use successful downtowns involve uses that generate activity these uses can populate the streets create excitement increase safety and reinforce downtown as an important destination among the uses that contribute to this activity are specialty retail shops eating and drinking establishments and entertainment facilities the importance of the downtown can also be enhanced by emphasizing the mixture and intensity of uses that occur including housing and office uses this is particularity true for vertical mixture with residential and offices above the first floor a permitted ground level usesschool street frontage i retail all uses except driveup or drivein services ii eating and drinking establishments including those serving alcoholic beverages provided this service is clearly ancillary to food service  driveup or drivein restaurants not permitted iii personal services hair and nail salons shoe repair laundromats dry cleaners and similar businesses iv business services are storefront businesses that generate foot traffic such as photocopy shops photofinishers video rental and sales travel agencies appliance repair print shops insurance agencies or real estate agencies financial institutions and public utilities v nightclubs including establishments providing entertainment or permitting dancing and establishments serving alcoholic beverages not ancillary to food service above uses may require a conditional use permit as required by the lodi municipal  vi other business or service establishments if determined by the community development department staff to be of the same general character as those uses listed herein and above b permitted uses all other street frontages and upper level school street frontage i all permitted uses listed above ii driveiii professional offices c upper level uses subject to a conditional use

intended to illustrate and simplify the appropriate development and renovation concepts in terms of more subjective considerations such as character or design details the guidelines are not intended to be an exhaustive list of strict standards but rather statements to encourage improvement which is sensitive to the downtown they also serve as criteria for design review by city staff and the site plan and architectural review committee sparc no particular architectural style is prescribed 1 building composition every building should have a base a clear pattern of openings and surface features a recognizable entry and an interesting roofline 2 storefronts are like small buildings with their own base roofline and pattern of window and door openings a base panel of tile or other special material is recommended below display windows materials recommended for walls are generally suitable base materials should be the same or visually heavier materials than walls i brick should be used as the main wall surface ii ceramic tile is frequently used as a storefront base dark tile with light stucco is an effective combination different colors and sizes of tile may be used for a decorative effect b display windows large pane windows encompassing a minimum of sixty percent of the storefront surface area are recommended where privacy is desired for restaurants professional service etc windows should be divided into smaller panes tinted windows may be used refer to glazing section c transom windows are horizontal panels of glass between the storefront and second floor they are a traditional element of main street buildings and are recommended for all new or renovated storefronts transom windows can be good locations for neon paintedwindow and other relatively nonobtrusive types of signs d recessed entries are recommended as another traditional element of the main street storefront recommended treatments include i special paving materials such as ceramic tile  ii ornamental ceiling treatments such as coffering  iii decorative light fixtures e doors should be substantial and welldetailed they are the one part of the storefront that patrons will invariably touch and feel they should match the materials design and character of the display window framing door styles six inches or less are not recommended f cornices should be provided at the second floor or roofline for a onestory building to differentiate the storefront from upper levels of the building to add visual interest and to allow the storefront to function as the base for the rest of the building g new or renovated storefronts within existing buildings should emulate or recreate a previous store front from historic photos or drawings in order to harmonize with the overall building architecture 3 building increments storefronts andor building bays should be approximately twentyfive feet in width buildings with a longer frontage should have a vertical architectural featurecolumn pilaster etc every twentyfive feet a pattern of features windows wall panels pilaster building bays and storefronts should be based on a module derived from the buildings structural bay spacing features based on this module should be carried across windowless walls to relieve blank uninteresting surfaces b building entrances should be prominent and easy to identify i spacing entries to shops or lobbies should be spaced a maximum of fifty feet apart ii main building entrance should be easily identifiable and distinguishable from storefronts a marked by a taller mass above such as a tower or within a volume that protrudes from the rest of building surface  b located in the center of the facade as part of a symmetrical overall composition  c accented by architectural elements such as columns overhanging roofs awnings ornamental light fixtures iii prominent corner entrances for shops or other active uses should be provided by corner buildings c roofs and rooflines should provide visual interest and complement the overall facade composition i parapet walls are recommended  they should have a distinct shape or profile eg a gable arc raised center ii accent elements such as flags cutout openings grilles and latticework ornamental medallions or building numbers are also recommended iii mechanical equipment on rooftops should be screened preferably behind a parapet roof latticework louvered panels and other treatments that are compatible with the buildings architecture may also be appropriate 4 special architectural features such as gables and tower elements should be used to accent buildings at major street corners and other highlyvisible locations a cut into the building mass such as a diagonal at a corner building or a notch for a grand building entry can also be effective 5 side and rear building facades should have a level of trim and finish compatible with the front facade or an architectural mural particularly if they are visible from streets adjacent parking areas or residential buildings 6 wall treatments if the building mass and pattern of windows and doors is complex simple wall surfaces are preferable eg stucco if the building volume and the pattern of wall openings is simple additional wall texture and articulation should be employed eg bricks or blocks in both cases pilasters columns and cornices should be used to add visual interest and pedestrian scale the selection and placement of materials on the exterior of a building is important in providing an attractive design material change should occur on different planes in order to appear more substantial and integral to the design of the elevation change should occur where architectural elements intersect such as a pilaster or projection the number of materials on the exterior elevation should be limited to prevent visual overload materials should have a traditional or logical application heavy materials should appear to hold up lighter materials a brick full size brick veneer is preferable to brick tile brick veneers should be mortared to give the appearance of structural brick brick tile applications should use wraparound corner and bullnose pieces to minimize a veneer appearance b brick veneers are appropriate as a special material for wall panels or sills in combination with other materials such as brick or concrete c pouredinplace concrete options in terms of formwork pigments and aggregates should be explored to create rich surfaces accents such as ceramic tile are recommended for decorative effect d concrete block concrete block is available in various sizes surface textures and colors decorative treatments such as alternating courses of differing heights should be used stack bond plain gray concrete block is not recommended e ceramic tile is recommended as an accent material f stucco integral coloring should be used for lower maintenance and wear g not recommended i simulated finishes such as artificial stone or metal cladding ii wood shingles and shakes vertical board and batten shingles shakes are not recommended  they have a ruralresidential character iii plywood siding includes t111 siding 7 windows are an important element of building composition and an indicator of overall building quality a windowwall proportion in general upper stories should have a window to wall area proportion typically thirty to fifty percent that is smaller than that of ground floor storefronts b window openings should generally be vertical or square in shape  if square windows andor window panes should be vertical in shape c window inset glass should be inset a minimum of three inches from the exterior wall surface to add relief to the wall surface  this is especially important for stucco buildings d shaped frames sills andor lentils should be used to enhance openings and add additional relief they should be proportional to the glass area framed  eg a larger window should have thicker framing members e muntins true divided light windows or sectional windows are recommend where a divided window design is desired  where snapin muntins are used they must be both sides of the glass f glazing clear glazing is strongly recommended reflective glazing should not be used if tinted glazing is used the tint should be kept as light as possible  green gray and blue are recommended g replacementrenovation wood windows should be replaced with wood windows of the same operating type eg doublehung casement etc vinyl covered wood windows are available for lower maintenance if aluminum replacement windows or doors are used they should be i same operating type and orientation as the original windows eg do not replace a doublehung window with a horizontal sliding window ii factory painted or fluorocoated to match the original  color anodized is also acceptable iii similar in size and thickness to the original frame and muntins 8 roofs should match the principal building in terms of style detailing and materials they should also contribute expressive and interesting forms that add to the overall character of the district recommended types are a tar and gravel composition or elastomeric roofs should be screened by parapets or falsefront sections of sloping roofs b clay ceramic or concrete tile colorful glazed ceramic tiles are recommended for decorative roof shapes such as parapets domes and turrets c metal seam roofing should be anodized fluorocoated or painted copper and lead roofs should be natural or oxidized 9 canopies awnings and other buildingmounted accessories a awnings are recommended they should be a colorful fabric mounted over a metal structural that is framed and attractive in design fabric awnings are generally preferable to permanent canopies internally illuminated vinyl awnings are not acceptable b trellises and canopies materials colors and form should be derived from the building architecture c height and projection trellises canopies and awnings should be a minimum of eight feet above the sidewalk they should project no more than two feet from the face of curb depending upon the width of the sidewalk d placement of trellises canopies and awnings should be above the display windows and below the storefront cornice or sign panel they should not cover pipes pilasters clerestory windows or other architectural features individual awnings accents and complements the building more effectively than one continuous awning e accessories colorful banners should be used to add variety to the street ornamental brackets and poles add further interest hanging flower or plant baskets suspended from ornamental brackets of metal or wood are recommended for storefronts 10 color in general drab earthtones should not be used building wall color should contrast trim colors  for example neutral or light walls with dark colors and saturated hues for accent and ornamental colors  white or light window and door trim on a medium or dark building wall colors of adjacent buildings should be taken into consideration a secondary color like a wainscot pilasters cornices capitals and bands b bright colors should be used sparingly typical applications are fabric awnings and banners a restrained use of bright colors also allows display windows and merchandise to catch the eye and stand out in the visual field e additions renovations and restorations changes to the commercial environment will most likely take place in the form of renovation or restoration as uses change and remodeling projects are proposed owners are encouraged to upgrade their property in a manner consistent with the character of the downtown one of the most effective ways to attract attention and encourage shopping is to create an attractive well designed storefront and building entry many buildings in downtown lodi have distinctive architectural qualities that make important contributions to the visual character these qualities could be improved or emphasized to the benefit of the entire area sensitive alteration or restoration of existing buildings enhances their historic value to ensure proper work the services of an architect specializing in restoration and preservation work are highly recommended 1 additions and alterations should be sensitive to the scale and character of storefront areas in general of adjacent buildings and of the building itself generally they should reflect one of the following conditions a identical to the architecture of the original building as if the same architect or builder built more of the same building this is usually most successful and feasible where the addition is smaller than the original building b interpretation of the older building andor other adjacent buildings the older building is not imitated exactly but certain characteristics are copied using contemporary materials and construction practices this is most successful where the addition is larger than the older building some of their contextual strategies are i architectural lines and rhythms of older buildings are extended to the new building  such as floor and cornice heights window and bay spacing ii colors and materials are selected to coordinate and harmonize between the old and new structures iii small elements may be identical on both buildings to link them  window and door trim paint colors signs light fixtures etc 2 restorations restoring the original form and appearance of old buildings is recommended many modernizations of 19th and early 20th century storefront buildings cover fine facades and other architectural features that can be restored paint covered or blockedin clerestory windows are common as are upper stories that have been plastered over or covered with metal fascia or awnings 3 repair and cleaning care should be taken to avoid damaging the value of historic buildings in particular a masonry materials such as concrete and brick should not be sandblasted as this damages the surface of the material  lowpressure water cleaning should be used instead sealers for waterproofing should be used after cleaning and repair 4 replacement of unavailable components when historic construction materials cannot be replaced or matched care should be taken to match the original pattern thickness color and texture as closely as possible with available materials in general simulated replacement materials artificial stone simulated aged brick are discouraged the restoration architect and various specialty building supply businesses can assist in the selection of proper materials f lighting building and accent lighting in the downtown is an effective mechanism to attract attention to a structures details and the business as well further lighting shall be used for parking areas

the design construction review and approval of industrial development in the city of lodi the city of lodi recognizes the unique requirements of industrial development and the potential for such development design to make a positive contribution to the appearance of the community site and building design provisions herein are focused on the view from public rightsofway and compatibility with surrounding development this chapter will help ensure that new projects will be well designed uphold the citys vision and contribute to the quality of the public realm b applicability 1 the design guidelines in this chapter apply to the sites designated as industrial in the general plan the general plan industrial land use designation includes the general mills factory and sites along the railroad and east of state route 99 the design elements of each project including site design architecture landscaping parking design will be reviewed on a comprehensive basis 2 the review authority may interpret these design guidelines with some flexibility in their application to specific projects as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each project in some circumstances one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with another guideline determined by the review authority to be more important in the particular case the overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed c building orientation 1 design industrial sites to minimize the visual impacts of parking areas equipment and outdoor storage from public rightsofway mitigate these undesirable visual impacts placement and design of buildings screen walls and landscaping 2 new buildings shall be oriented toward the adjoining public streets so that public entrances are a focal point on the building and site layout 3 industrial buildings shall be oriented so that bays and loading docks do not directly face the primary street frontage loading areas shall be located in the rear or side of the building whenever possible  however they should never face adjacent residential uses d building design and architecture 1 massing and scale a organize the massing of larger buildings into components that more readily relate to the human scale b reduce the mass and scale of large industrial buildings with building facades and wall height variations and by articulating rooflines and wall planes c avoid long repetitive monotonous facades particularly those that repeat the same design element several times along the same elevation d the scale of buildings on the site edge shall be compatible with the scale of adjoining development where surrounding development is of a small scale large scale buildings shall be located internal to the site and transition down in scale as the outer edge of the site approaches 2 articulation and detail a individual design elements shall be faithful to the overall architecture of the building architectural details shall be part of the design and not something applied as an afterthought a consistent design theme provides continuity and avoids confusion of style b front and streetside facades of large buildings visible from a public street or adjacent residential property shall include architectural features such as reveals windows and openings trellises changes in color texture and material to add interest to the building elevation and reduce its visual mass c consideration shall be given to recessing building floors above the first story and providing vertical or horizontal offsets in the wall surfaces at regular intervals including columns projections and recesses eg every twenty feet d all sides of the building visible from the street or residential property shall have the same level of architectural detailing as the main elevation e primary building entries shall have pedestrian scale and shall be expressed with windows awnings trellises articulation arcades landscape planters and material changes or other design elements so that the building entry is easily identified and visible from the street and parking lot f architectural detail at the street level shall establish human scale and enhance the buildings and the streetscapes appearance 3 roofs a roofs shall be compatible with the architectural style and scale of the building b the roof shape shall reflect the configuration of the buildings mass and volume and shall be consistent in its character where visible from public streets c rooflines for large buildings shall be broken up and varied by providing change in the height of a portion of the roofs change in form or other articulations high pitched aframe type rooflines and partial mansards should be avoided 4 building materials and colors a innovative use of durable high quality materials such as brick stone tile stucco and concrete is encouraged b incorporation of energy conservation features is encouraged in industrial buildings to exceed californias 2005 title 24 regulation standards for building energy efficiency c use a color scheme for example two analogous colors plus a complementary trim color to create visual interest and enhance the streetscape appearance of the building d use earthtone colors and keep the number of colors used on the building and within the overall streetscape to a minimum e use smaller articulated varied color and texture wall surfaces rather than larger homogenous ones f the same exterior colors and finishes shall be used on all sides of the structure g building color shall not be used as signage branding or business identification h awning materials shall be compatible with the overall design and character of the building the use of fabric awnings is encouraged the use of vinyl and plastic awnings is discouraged e parking and circulation 1 site access shall allow for easy circulation throughout the project to minimize conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians between employeevisitor traffic and truck shippingdelivery separate walkways shall be provided to the public way from the main entrance main pedestrian routes areas to building entrances shall have decorative paving treatment or other demarcation of pedestrian rightofway 2 enhance primary entry drives for automobiles especially visitors with ornamental landscaping special treatment and monument type signs to communicate site access locations 3 parking lots shall not be the dominant visual element of the site it is generally more visually appealing to locate parking lots along the side or the rear of buildings small customeroriented parking lots are appropriate toward the front of the site  however the majority of employee parking should be located to the rear of the site to the maximum extent feasible to avoid large expanses of paved areas large parking lots should be divided into smaller parking areas buildings should not be located in a manner that make them appear like islands surrounded by paved areas 4 the number of site accesses ingressegress shall be controlled in terms of the location and number of driveways to minimize traffic safety conflicts street congestion and unnecessarily disrupted street frontage where possible adjoining properties should share access driveways to minimize the number of driveways along public streets shared service or secondary access alleys shall also be considered use of an existing side street for primary or secondary access is encouraged as opposed to creating one or more new curb cuts on a collector or arterial street 5 new streets for industrial projects shall be designed to handle heavier loads associated with truck operations as necessary larger turning movements shall also be included in new streets to facilitate truck movements f landscaping 1 emphasis shall be placed on california or mediterranean style landscaping particularly indigenous plants ornamental vines and flowers in either container pots or as part of an arbortrellis landscaping must be well maintained with drip irrigation systems for treesgarden beds and pots that do not drain across the pavement 2 all landscaping shall employ features and techniques that reduce the demand for and consumption of water including appropriate lowwater plants a high degree of paving permeability and water conserving irrigation techniques and systems recycled water should be utilized to the extent possible 3 trees in paved areas shall be provided with deep root barriers deep root automatic irrigation and expandable metal tree grates of adequate size root barriers shall be of a material specifically designed for containing tree roots irrigation shall be adapted for deep watering 4 planting plans for building setbacks should include a hierarchy of plantings in terms of size and types of plant materials that mark the transition between the horizontal ground plane at the sidewalk or parking area and the tall vertical facades of buildings 5 the use of vines trellises and landscape screen walls is strongly encouraged on larger areas of unadorned building facades to soften the appearance and to deter graffiti 6 increase the amount of landscaping and special landscape features at project entries and pedestrian gathering areas 7 minimize the quantity of impervious paving in parking areas and maximize the use of landscaping or permeable pavement onsite to reduce surface water runoff and the need for water detention basins 8 where it is infeasible to locate all large parking areas to the rear of the building views of expansive paved areas from public rightsofway andor residential areas shall be minimized by landscaping within and along the perimeter of parking lots 9 required parking lot landscaping shall include the use of landscape planters along parking aisles throughout the parking lot 10 streetscapes shall incorporate a mix of trees shrubbery and ground cover to establish a landscape corridor presence 11 consideration shall be given to the incorporation of open space areas in the form of courtyards plazas shaded arcades and functional landscaped areas these features should link adjoining buildings and take advantage of outdoor as well as indoor space these features can be located in areas with recessed facades or setbacks in excess of minimum standards and may be designed for use by employees andor customers pedestrian features such as benches tables fountains artwork and landscaping should be incorporated as focal points or relaxation area g lighting 1 the design and location of outdoor lighting fixtures shall preclude direct glare onto adjoining nonindustrial property and streets 2 outdoor lighting shall be designed to foster security illumination should be increased at building entries to increase visibility and safety 3 use landscape lighting and exterior lighting to enhance project design features lighting fixtures shall have sharp cut off so that no direct lighting falls onto adjacent properties or the public rightofway 4 as applicable illuminate flags only with very narrow spot type lamps directed no more than fifteen degrees from vertical shield fixtures so that the light source is not visible from offsite h equipment service area and refuse area screening 1 roofmounted utility and communication equipment shall be screened from view by structural features that are an integral part of the buildings architectural design 2 loading and service areas shall be concealed from view within the building envelope or shall be located to the rear of the site and designed for minimal visual impact and circulation conflicts 3 when trash enclosures loading docks utility equipment and similar uses are visible from a street they shall be screened using materials colors and landscaping that are harmonious with the site design and building architecture 4 trash enclosures shall provide an area for recycling i metal buildings metal buildings present their own special set of challenges and opportunities in the community context if metal buildings are well articulated and surfaces are judiciously mixed with other materials or textures and colors they can make an attractive contribution to industrial park appearance 1 metal buildings should incorporate architectural features such as gable hip and other sloping roof forms prominent main entries windows storefront glazed doors canopies and window awnings use of brick or stone at building base and architectural lighting fixtures to make a positive contribution to the streetscape 2 street frontages of metal buildings shall present sloping or articulated roof forms eaves and steeper roof pitches are more attractive than shallow roofs and roofs without eaves 3 as with all building design roofs particularly metal roofs contribute significantly to a buildings appearance and character variety in roof shapes and colors should complement the scale of the building darker nonglare colors help reduce the mass of metal roof designs metal roofs can incorporate standing seam tile and shake materials to create visual interest in design 4 long stark and uninterrupted panels used for metal buildings shall be avoided use of panels with continuous vertical seams shall also be avoided other building materials should be incorporated into structural design to add contrast variety and visual interest in building form wall systems should use techniques that hide or disguise wall fastening systems and seams building features such as columns curved metal corners deep reveals at construction joints or other details should be incorporated into building design to add interest into the architectural design 5 window treatments can provide a key design element for metal buildings windows shall particularly be incorporated along the street front elevations to help metal buildings incorporate humanscale design elements that address the building to the street windows should incorporate changes in building plane by either recessing or projecting them as integral parts of the overall design theme detailed window fenestration should be incorporated around windows including change in relief color pattern andor materials 6 downspouts shall be concealed unless they are part of the design in which case downspouts shall be coated to match the wall color 7 any freestanding outbuildings shall use forms shapes and materials that are consistent with the main structure 8 large expanses of light colored metal wall materials shall be avoided darker colors help visually reduce the prominence of large metal buildings horizontal color bands and wall projections and recesses provide shadowing to accentuate differentiation for wall designs consider using corrugated or flat fiberreinforced cement panels as well as metal  2202013 special purpose zoning districts   purpose of chapter this chapter lists the uses of land that may be allowed within the special purpose zoning districts established

loading spaces shall be located based on the operating characteristics of the proposed use 1 as near as possible to the main structure and limited to the rear twothirds of the parcel if feasible  2 loading facilities shall be discouraged from facing streets where not possible to do otherwise ensure that the loading facility is screened from adjacent streets as much as possible  3 to ensure that loading and unloading takes place onsite and in no case within adjacent public rightsofway or other traffic areas onsite  4 to ensure that vehicular maneuvers occur onsite  and 5 to avoid adverse impacts upon neighboring residential properties b dimensions loading spaces shall be not less than twelve feet in width fortyfive feet in length with fourteen feet of vertical clearance c lighting

ownertenant in a clear and visible manner at all times  2202013   parking and circulation design guidelines a general design considerations the primary design considerations for parking lot layout and site access are safety and efficiency minimizing the visual impact of large paved areas reinforcing the street environment integrating parking into overall site development and maximizing pedestrian orientation by means of lighting landscape hardscape and parking layout 1 factors to consider the following factors should be considered in the design and development of offstreet parking areas a ingress and egress with consideration to possible conflicts with vehicular and pedestrian traffic  b intraparking lot pedestrian and vehicular conflicts  c reinforcing the street edge and a pedestrian environment  d onsite circulation and service vehicle zones  e overall configuration and appearance of the parking area  f promoting compatibility with adjacent land uses  g minimizing opportunities for crime and undesirable activities surveillance access control and activity support  h potential to connect parking lot with neighboring properties  i shading the parking lot by means of canopy trees and other landscaping  j creating a sense of spatial organization and experiential meaning layout of the design of the parking lot  k reducing heat gain by shading pavement and employing lightcolored pavement and walls  and l maximizing onsite percolation and minimizing runoff to storm drains 2 location of parking lots should not occupy street frontages and should be located behind buildings to the maximum extent feasible so that the street frontage in both residential and nonresidential areas remains pedestrianoriented 3 relationship to adjacent buildings parking areas should be separated from buildings by either a raised concrete walkway or landscaped strip if space allows parking stalls directly abutting buildings should be avoided 4 pedestrianfriendly features lighting landscaping hardscape fencing parking layout and pedestrian paths should all contribute to the strength and clarity of the parking lot as a deliberate and thorough design b access and entries 1 pedestrian and vehicular entrances must be clearly identified and easily accessible to minimize pedestrian and vehicle conflicts entrances to parking lots should be from alleys or between buildings retaining the street frontage for buildings and locating parking to the rear of buildings or to the side where no other alternative is available the use of enhanced paving landscaping and special architectural features and details is encouraged to distinguish entrances 2 where a parking cannot be located other than adjacent to a public street the facility should include a point of entry and clear and safe access for pedestrians from the lot to the onstreet sidewalk to the sidewalk entrance of the building figure 33  enhanced parking lot facility c lighting carefully designed lighting is an essential element of good parking lot design the placement type height number and bulb type of lights should all contribute to a coherent lighting design see lighting under commercial guidelines d hardscape 1 a well thoughtout selection and composition of hardscape materials can help to order space and reinforce the relationship of the parking lot to its surroundings and to the buildings it serves entrance and exit areas areas that are the central focus of the parking lot design major axis and areas that act as forecourts for entrances may be suitable locations for special paving materials such as brick or stamped asphalt figure 34  hardscape materials 2 limit curb cuts for driveways opening to public streets common shared access driveways which provide access to more than one site are encouraged to reduce the number of driveway entries along commercial streets figure 35  spacing or driveway curb cuts 3 design parking areas so that pedestrians walk parallel to moving cars minimize the need for the pedestrian to cross parking aisles and landscape areas 4 access for service vehicles trash collection and storage areas should be located on alleys where alleys exist e circulation 1 separate vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems should be provided where possible the layout of parking areas should be designed so that pedestrians walk parallel to moving cars minimizing the need to walk between parked cars or to cross parking aisles and landscape areas 2 pedestrian linkages between uses in commercial developments should be emphasized parking lot designs should include walkways and planting that help direct pedestrians comfortably and safely to their destinations figure 36  pedestrian connections 3 parking aisles should be separated from primary vehicle circulation routes whenever possible figure 37  separate circulation from parking areas 4 where parking areas are connected interior circulation should allow for a similar direction of travel and parking spaces in all areas to reduce conflict at points of connection figure 38  shared parking access f landscaping screening and buffering 1 parking facilities should be landscaped with the following objectives in mind a visually break up large paved areas with landscaping  b maximize distribution of landscaping  c promote compatibility and function as a good neighbor  d consider the use of trees planted at regular distances as a grove  and e reduce the amount of storm water runoff resulting from the lot  and f shade fifty percent of the asphalt area within five years from time of installation 2 if a parking lot must be located adjacent to a street the lot should be landscaped to soften the visual impact of parked vehicles from the public rightofway screening should consist of a combination of low walls and landscape materials the objective is to strike a balance between screening parked automobiles and facilitate safety surveillance opportunities 3 as long as an open surveillance zone is maintained between thirtytwo and six feet above grade landscaping should be used in combination with walls and fences 4 planting areas adjacent to parking areas drives or walks should be protected by curbing where necessary while allowing for drainage of surface water into permeable surface areas see figure 39 figure 39  protect landscaping 5 both perimeter and interior landscaping should incorporate canopytype trees the location and spacing of trees is dependent on the type of tree used but the overall effect should be of a relatively consistent tree cover which will shade the pavement and vehicles see figure 310 figure 310  tree cover 6 reduce conflicts between trees lighting and signage by coordinating location of trees light poles and signs the maximum height of lights shall be lower than the typical pruning height of the tree used the use of monument signs is highly encouraged to reduce treesign conflicts 7 all trees indicated on plans shall be planted and no change of species is allowed unless approved by the director 8 planter areas shall have increased soil volume and reduced compaction to an appropriate level set by the submitted plans the use of structural soil mix under paving to retain parking space while increasing soil volume is highly encouraged 9 tree well and planting islands shall have a minimum dimension of eight feet and be excavated to a depth of three feet and filled with amended soil as necessary 10 stakes shall be removed from trees as soon as the tree can support itself 11 the pruning of parking lot trees early in order to train their growth is encouraged 12 tree care should be performed under the supervision of a certified arborist 13 if a tree is removed it must be replaced with a tree of equivalent size and value  2202013 signs footnotes  2  editors note  adopted  repealed the former ch 1734   and enacted a new ch 1734 as set out herein the former ch 1734 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  adopted    purpose of chapter the city finds that signage regardless of content or purpose draws the visual attention of the public and thereby creates a traffic safety hazard and degrades the aesthetic quality of the environment the regulations established by this chapter are intended to address these issues by regulating the placement quality materials size and number of signs allowed within the city and to require the proper maintenance of signs the purposes of these limitations and requirements are to a enhance commerce within the community by providing for signs that will allow the public to easily identify uses and premises and regulating signs on the basis of their physical design location and proportions  b preserve and enhance the aesthetic traffic safety and environmental values of the community and commercial office and industrial districts while at the same time providing a channel of communication to the public  c limit commercial signage to onsite locations to keep the proliferation of this signage to a more aesthetic proportion and protect existing businesses from visual encroachment from new signage on neighboring properties  d avoid traffic safety hazards to motorists and pedestrians caused by visual distractions and obstructions  e promote the aesthetic quality of the community by providing for signs that enhance the attractiveness of the city as a place to live work and shop  and f safeguard and protect the public health safety and general welfare  762016   applicability a signs regulated the requirements and development standards

shall occur as follows 1 the surface area of a sign shall be calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of all framing writing logo representation emblem or other display within a single continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles with no more than eight lines see figure 311 figure 311  sign area measurement 2 supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be computed as sign area 3 for freestanding signs all readable surfaces visible from a public rightofway shall be counted in sign area calculations 4 where a sign consists of one or more threedimensional objects ie balls cubes clusters of objects sculpture or statuelike trademarks the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane 5 for signs that incorporate time and temperature devices the area of these devices shall not be included in the total area of the sign b sign height sign height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the

than ten feet from any property line and ten feet from any access driveway  and c not within a radius of twenty feet of the intersection of the rightsofway of two intersecting streets 6 the location of all signs shall be evaluated to ensure a that the setback is appropriate for the height and area of a freestanding or projecting sign  b that flush or projecting signs relate to the architectural design of the building signs that cover windows or that spill over natural boundaries and architectural features shall be discouraged  c that signs do not unreasonably block the sight lines of existing signs on adjacent properties  and d pedestrian and vehicular safety 7 a freestanding sign may be placed only on a site frontage adjoining a public street 8 no freestanding sign shall be closer than seventyfive feet to another freestanding sign to ensure adequate visibility for all signs the director may waive this requirement where parcel width andor the locations of existing signs on adjacent properties would make the seventyfivefoot separation impractical d design criteria for signs the following design criteria shall be used in reviewing the design of individual signs substantial conformance with each of the following design criteria shall be required before a sign permit or building permit can be approved 1 color colors on signs and structural members should be harmonious with one another and reflective of the dominant colors of the building or buildings being identified contrasting colors may be utilized if the overall effect of the sign is still compatible with the building colors and prevailing colors in the surrounding neighborhood where a theme can be identified 2 materials and structure a sign materials including those for framing and support should be representative of the type and scale of materials used on the building or buildings which the sign identifies insofar as possible sign materials should match the materials used on the building and on other signs b materials selected for permanent signs shall be durable and capable of withstanding weathering over the life of the sign with reasonable maintenance c the size of the structural members eg columns crossbeams and braces should be proportional to the sign panel they are supporting in general fewer larger supporting members are preferable to many smaller supports d the use of individual letters incorporated into the building design is encouraged rather than signs with background and framing other than the building wall e the use of reflective materials or surfaces may be approved only where the review authority determines that they will not distract motorists or create other hazards and should be minimized in all cases f wall signs shall not project from the surface upon which they are attached more than required for construction purpose and in no case more than twelve inches g wall signs shall not project above the eave line or the edge of the roof of a building e copy design guidelines the city does not regulate the message content copy of signs  however the following are principles of copy design and layout that can enhance the readability and attractiveness of signs copy design and layout consistent with these principles is encouraged but not required 1 sign copy should relate only to the name andor nature of the business or commercial center 2 permanent signs that advertise continuous sales special prices etc should be avoided 3 information should be conveyed briefly or by logo symbol or other graphic manner the intent should be to increase the readability of the sign and thereby enhance the identity of the business 4 freestanding signs should contain the street address of the parcel or the range of addresses for a multitenant center f illumination of signs the artificial illumination of signs either from an internal or external source shall be designed to minimize light and glare on surrounding rightsofway and properties 1

be subject to expedited judicial review in accordance with the time limits set forth in civil procedure et seq  762016   sign design guidelines the following guidelines should be considered in the design of all signs within lodi these guidelines are intended to complement other requirements in the previous sections of this chapter a design compatibility 1 creative design encouraged signs should make a positive contribution to the general appearance of the street and commercial area in which they are located a welldesigned sign can be a major asset to a building 2 proportionate size and scale the scale of signs should be appropriate for the building on which they are placed and the area in which they are located the size and shape of a sign should be in proportion with the scale of the structure 3 integrate signs with the building signs should not obscure architectural features their design should be integrated with the design of the building a welldesigned building facade or storefront is created by the careful coordination of sign and architectural design and overall color scheme signs in multiple tenant buildings should be designed to complement or enhance the other signs in the building figure 313design compatibility 4 reduce sign impact because residential and commercial uses generally exist in close proximity signs should be designed and located so that they have little or no impact on adjacent residential neighborhoods figure 314reduce sign impact 5 sign placement place wall signs to establish facade rhythm scale and proportion where facade rhythm does not otherwise exist on buildings that have a monolithic or plain facade signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm scale and proportion figure 315sign placement 6 pedestrianoriented signs are encouraged it is desirable and encouraged to include a pedestrianoriented sign as one of the permitted signs for a business pedestrianoriented signs are signs that are designed for and directed toward pedestrians so that they can easily and comfortably read the sign as they stand adjacent to the business figure 316pedestrianoriented sign 7 use individual letters as an alternative to an attached sign lettering may be painted directly on the building facade however signs should not be painted directly over ornamental and architectural features or over brick and stone surfaces of buildings b color 1 select colors carefully color is one of the most important aspects of visual communication it can be used to catch the eye or to communicate ideas or feelings colors should be selected to contribute to legibility and design integrity even the most carefully thought out sign may be unattractive and a poor communicator because of poor color selection too many colors used thoughtlessly can confuse and negate the message of a sign 2 use contrasting colors contrast is an important influence on the legibility of signs a substantial contrast should be provided between the color and material of the background and the letters or symbols to make the sign easier to read in both day and night light letters on a dark background or dark letters on a light background are most legible figure 317contrasting letters and background 3 avoid using too many colors colors or color combinations that interfere with legibility of the sign copy or that interfere with viewer identification of other signs should be avoided small accents of several colors may make a sign unique and attractive but the competition of large areas of many different colors often decreases readability 4 use complementary colors sign colors should complement the colors used on the structures and the project as a whole c materials 1 sign materials the following sign materials are recommended a wood carved sandblasted etched and properly sealed primed and painted or stained b metal formed etched cast engraved and properly primed and painted or factorycoated to protect against corrosion c high density preformed foam or similar material new materials may be very appropriate if properly designed in a manner consistent with these guidelines and painted or otherwise finished to compliment the architecture d custom neon tubing in the form of graphics or lettering may be incorporated into several allowed sign types 2 compatibility of materials sign materials should be compatible with the design of the face of the facade where they are placed the selected materials should contribute to the legibility of the sign for example glossy finishes are often difficult to read because of glare and reflections 3 appropriate materials paper and cloth signs are not suitable for exterior use except on awnings because they deteriorate quickly paper and cloth signs are appropriate for interior temporary use only the use of interior signs on paper or cloth should be the result of careful thinking about readability and the image of the business d sign legibility an effective sign should do more than attract attention it should communicate a message usually this is a question of the readability of words and phrases the most significant influence on legibility is lettering 1 pedestrianoriented signs make signs smaller if they are oriented to pedestrians the pedestrianoriented sign is usually read from a distance of fifteen to twenty feet  the vehicleoriented sign is viewed from a much greater distance the closer a signs viewing distance the smaller that sign need be see table 33 table 33 lettering size for pedestrianoriented signs minimum character size inches intended reading distance feet 35 60 40 70 45 80 50 90 55 to 60 100 2 use a brief message a brief message should be used whenever possible the fewer the words the more effective the sign a sign with a brief succinct message is easier to read and looks more attractive evaluate each word if the word does not contribute directly to the basic message of the sign it detracts from it and probably should be deleted 3 space letters and words carefully letters and words should not be spaced too closely crowding of letters words or lines will make any sign more difficult to read conversely overspacing these elements causes the viewer to read each item individually again obscuring the message as a general rule letters should not occupy more than seventyfive percent of sign panel area 4 use symbols and logos symbols and logos can be used in place of words wherever appropriate pictographic images will usually register more quickly in the viewers mind than a written message figure 318use of symbolslogos figure 319letter spacing 5 limit the number of letter styles the number of lettering styles should be limited in order to increase legibility a general rule to follow is to limit the number of different letter types to no more than two for small signs and three for larger signs intricate typefaces and symbols that are difficult to read reduce the signs ability to communicate e sign illumination the possible illumination of a sign should be carefully considered like color illumination can provide more effective visual communication or can confuse the message imaginative and innovative lighting techniques for signs are encouraged 1 use illumination only if necessary consider if the sign needs to be lighted at all lights in the window display may be sufficient to identify the business this is particularly true if good window graphics are used often nearby street lights provide ample illumination of a sign after dark figure 320use of existing illumination 2 use a direct light source if the sign can be illuminated by a direct source of light eg spotlight this is usually the best arrangement because the sign will appear to be better integrated with the buildings architecture light fixtures supported in front of the structure cast light on the sign and generally a portion of the face of the structure as well direct lighting emphasizes the continuity of the structures surface and signs become an integral part of the facade direct lighting is also appropriate because it produces a more intimate ambiance on the street the lighting of signs should be considered as an element in a buildings overall lighting design 3 shield the light source whenever direct lighting fixtures are used fluorescent or incandescent care should be taken to properly shield the light source to prevent glare from spilling over into residential areas and any public rightofway signs should be lighted only to the minimum level required for nighttime readability figure 321shielded light source 4 backlighted signs backlighted solid letters are encouraged signs consisting of opaque individually cut letters mounted directly on a structure push can often use a distinctive element of the structures facade as a backdrop thereby providing a better integration of the sign with the structure figure 322backlighted signs  762016 standards for
