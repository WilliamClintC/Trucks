an incident to the adoption of the ordinance from which this division derives the city council city council of the city of columbia south carolina the city makes the following findings 1 secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in the united states killing 53000 americans prematurely each year  and 2 the us environmental protection agency us centers for disease control and prevention national toxicology programs report on carcinogens national cancer institute and the international agency for research and cancer have all reported that secondhand smoke is a group a human carcinogen a cancer causing substance of which there is no safe level of exposure  and 3 the health consequences of involuntary smoking have been reported by the us surgeon general to be a cause of disease including lung cancer in healthy nonsmokers  and 4 the us surgeon general has concluded that a simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same airspace does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers  and 5 numerous medical and scientific studies show substantial levels of exposure to secondhand smoke among the united states population and over the past two decades the health hazards resulting from exposure to secondhand smoke have been increasingly recognized  and 6 secondhand smoke increases the risk of developing breast cancer in younger premenopausal women  and when inhaled by pregnant women secondhand smoke increases the risk for lowweight babies preterm delivery and sudden infant death syndromesids  and 7 exposure to secondhand smoke by children leads to decreased lung function asthma pneumonia ear infections bronchitis and even sudden infant death syndrome  and 8 studies of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in helena montana and pueblo colorado before during and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect has determined that laws to enforce smokefree workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease  and 9 workplaces have been shown to be locations of significant exposure to secondhand smoke by employees working in the city of columbia  and 10 there are laws ordinances and regulations in place that protect workers from other environmental hazards including class a carcinogens asbestos arsenic and benzene but none which regulate exposure to secondhand smoke  and 11 the south carolina general assembly at et seq the clean indoor air act of 1990 imposed certain limitations on smoking for example it limited smoking in government buildings the definition of which includes cityowned buildings except where the owner of such building shall designate smoking areas city council has now determined that additional regulation of smoking in areas beyond those addressed in the clean indoor air act of 1990 is appropriate in furtherance of its duty to protect the health of its citizens and employees in the workplace and therefore enacts this division b intent city council finds that it is in the best interest of the people of this city to protect nonsmokers from involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace therefore city council declares that the purpose of this act is to preserve and improve the health comfort and environment of this city by limiting exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace  and 2 to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air and to recognize that the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority over the desire to smoke  11806 definitions the following

where the predominant character of urban development has not yet been fully established but where the current characteristics of use are predominantly residential agricultural or similar development with scattered related uses certain structures and uses required to serve governmental educational religious recreational and other needs of such areas are permitted as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to ensure compatibility of uses within the district and adjacent thereto it is further recognized that future demand for developable land will generate requests

transitional district the utd district is intended to accommodate uses typically found in singlefamily areas undergoing transition to commercial office uses district land uses will preserve the areas existing residential character while permitting commercial uses that are low traffic generators this district frequently occurs along developing street corridors and connects commercial clusters the residential character is preserved use of residential materials ie brick siding stucco etc and the use of pitched roofs on new buildings also traffic impacts will be lessened by minimizing curb cuts with possible shared driveways 1 c1 office and institutional district the c1 district is intended to accommodate office institutional and certain types of residential uses in areas whose

fronting on major arteries often referred to as strip commercial areas such development is often incompatible with adjacent uses and may lead to the eventual formation of commercial slums damage the trafficcarrying capacities of streets increase congestion lead to depreciation of property values in adjacent areas encourage undue dispersion of commercial facilities to the inconvenience of the public and create disproportionate costs in the provision of governmental services  c3a general commercial overlay district the c3a district is intended to accommodate a variety of general commercial

is therefore the intent of this article that c4 central area commercial districts be established only contiguous to or in the immediate vicinity of the c5 central business district zone  c5 central business district the c5 district is intended to accommodate those uses which taken together form the central business district characterized by retail core uses intensive office employment and complementary uses intended to serve persons who shop or work in the central business district certain related structures and uses required to serve the needs of the area are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the needs of this district since the central business district of the city serves a unique and special function it is the intent of this article that the c5 district classification be applied to one contiguous and continuous area and that before additional areas contiguous to those already classified c5 are considered for inclusion within the c5 district consideration should be given to the appropriateness of the c4 central area commercial district as an alternate designation intended to create a less congested character than that of the c5 district  c6 limited commercial district the c6 district is intended to accommodate those uses which complement the existing commercial character of shopping areas which serve a unique and special function within the city this district is characterized by a strong core of small businesses and a mixture of various types of eating and

commercial uses are allowed but are considered incidental to the predominantly industrial nature of the district certain related structures and uses required to serve the needs of the primary uses are permitted outright or are permissible as special exceptions subject to restrictions and requirements intended to best fulfill the intent of this article in addition certain uses are permitted only as special exceptions or are prohibited in order to protect such uses from the potentially incompatible characteristics of industrial areas  planned unit development districts a intent the intent of planned unit development districts is to derive the benefits of efficiency economy and flexibility by encouraging unified development of large sites while also obtaining the advantage of creative site design improved appearance compatibility of uses optimum service by community facilities and better functioning of vehicular access and circulation it is the intent of this article to allow development of large sites subject to specific regulations concerning permitted uses but only subject to regulations concerning lot area building coverage yard spaces and building height insofar as the city council shall deem appropriate to fulfill the intent of this article upon presentation of certification from the owners developers or other parties at interest in the development of such sites that they will adhere to development policies which will fulfill the intent of this article b types of districts two types of districts accommodating primarily residential or nonresidential uses are created as follows 1 pudr planned unit developmentresidential the pudr district is intended to accommodate residential uses with nonresidential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses 2 pudc planned unit developmentcommercial the pudc district is intended to accommodate primarily nonresidential uses with residential uses integrated into the design of such districts as secondary uses c design and planning features the types of residential dwelling units and the types of nonresidential uses allowed to be established in such districts increase with increasing site size of such districts based upon the premise that increased site size will allow proper design including functional interrelations buffer treatments separating uses with potentially incompatible characteristics of use design of access patterns and relationships of uses within such planned unit developments with uses in adjacent districts it is the intent of this article that such design and planning features be incorporated properly into any pud district hereafter created and that the planning commission and city council shall consider the existence and appropriateness of such features before any amendment to the zoning map is adopted to create such district  mu multiple use overlay district it is the intent of the mu overlay district to protect and improve the quality of the environment of the city by the identification and encouragement of efficient redevelopment of central city areas whose predominant character is no longer clearly defined or areas where a more efficient use of the land can be promoted by permitting multiple uses the multiple use concept is intended to promote utilization of innovative and creative urban design concepts such concepts are expected to achieve a more desirable urban environment than might be achieved urban development  ap airport height restrictive area it is the intent of the ap area to restrain influences which are adverse to the proper and safe conduct of aircraft operations in the vicinity of owens field airport to prevent creation of conditions hazardous to aircraft operation to prevent conflict with land development which may result in loss of life and property and to encourage development which is compatible with airport use characteristics within the intent and purpose of zoning to this end the ap

is to further the purposes set out in this section  fw and fp flood protective areas certain areas within the city are subject to periodic inundation by floodwater which results or may reasonably be foreseen to result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these hazards are caused or extended in part by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses which increase flood damage upon other lands or uses which are vulnerable to floods because they are inadequately elevated or not otherwise protected from flood damages it is therefore the intent of this article to lessen such hazards or losses by restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood hazards at the time of initial construction  and by controlling filling grading mineral extraction placing of obstructions within flood channels and other activities uses or characteristics of use which may increase flood damage  dp design and preservation area it is the intent of this article to protect and improve the quality of the environment

request for a modification of an existing wireless tower or base station that does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station 2 for purposes of subsection f a substantial change is a modification that substantially changes the physical dimensions of a tower or base station if it meets any of the following criteria a for towers outside of public rightsofway it increases the height of the tower by more than 10 percent or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet whichever is greater  for those towers in the rightsofway and for all base stations it increases the height of the tower or base station by more than ten percent or ten feet whichever is greater  b for towers outside of public rightsofway it protrudes from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance whichever is greater  for those towers in the rightsofway and for all base stations it protrudes from the edge of the structure more than six feet  c it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved but not to exceed four cabinets  d it entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site of the tower or base station  e it would defeat the existing concealment elements of the tower or base station  or f it does not comply with conditions associated with the prior approval of construction or modification of the tower or base station unless the noncompliance is due to an increase in height increase in width addition of cabinets or new excavation that does not exceed the corresponding substantial change thresholds identified above 3 other considerations a for purposes of evaluating whether a modification is a substantial change the changes in height resulting from a modification should be measured from the original support structure in cases where the deployments are or will be separated horizontally such as on buildings rooftops  in other circumstances changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the spectrum act on  b notwithstanding the provisions of this section the city

permissible uses or as a use in itself  b all special exceptions within fw areas  c all uses permissible in fp areas  and d all special exceptions in fp areas 2 general standards when reviewing applications for filling permits zoning permits and special exceptions the city engineer should take into account the following considerations and review the following factors a no structure storage of materials or equipment filling or other use should be approved which acting alone or in combination with existing or future uses will significantly increase the hazard of flood damage to other land or property b the danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocity or erosion damage shall be considered c the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others shall be considered d the proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease contamination and unsanitary conditions shall be considered e the relationship of the proposed use to the floodplain management program for the area shall be considered f the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles shall be considered g the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site shall be considered 3 filling grading excavating or dredging when reviewing applications for actions including filling grading excavating or dredging the following considerations should be reviewed a the proposed activity should be permitted only if it will not seriously disturb or interfere with natural drainage and will not significantly increase the elevation of floodwaters b the city engineer may require information for review relating to topographic engineering geologic or hydrologic features to determine the nature strength and distribution of existing and proposed soils and the adequacy of design criteria c the city engineer may recommend or attach conditions to the approval of applications pertaining to final slope and grade period of ground cover removal bulkheading construction of retaining walls riprapping landscaping drainage facilities reconstruction of natural storm drainage features and other matters d fill used for building sites should consist of sand gravel or other sand foundation material which will retain its structural bearing capacity under saturated conditions silts very fine sands clays peat and other high organic soils subject to compaction or erosion should not be used where mud peat or silt is not removed before placement of fill additional fill should be required to protect against settlement where water erosion is likely to occur fill should be protected by bulkheads riprap planting of vegetation or other protective measures 4 flood control works when reviewing applications for actions relating to the construction of flood controls or erosion control structures the city engineer should consider the following factors among others a all work should be designed to provide a degree of protection consistent with the intended use of the property b no work should be permitted which will damage the subject or adjoining properties c fill and other material for flood or erosion control should be protected as described in subsection e3d of this section 5 buildings when reviewing applications for actions relating to buildings the city engineer should consider the following factors among others a buildings should be designed with low flood damage potential b buildings should be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters c structures should be firmly anchored to prevent flotation which may result in damage to other structures d service facilities such as electrical equipment circuits heating and cooling equipment and appliances should be constructed above the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area or should be floodproofed 6 storage of materials and equipment when reviewing applications for action relating to the storage of materials and equipment the city engineer should consider the following factors among others a the storage or processing of materials that in time of flooding are flammable explosive or similarly hazardous or injurious should be prohibited b other materials or equipment stored in areas subject to flooding should not be subject to major damage by flooding and should be firmly anchored to prevent flotation or readily removable from the area within the time normally available after flood warning 7 use of floodproofing when reviewing applications for actions relating to the floodproofing of structures the city engineer should consider the following factors among others a structural floodproofing should not ordinarily be allowed for residences b structural floodproofing of nonresidential structures should be considered as acceptable flood protection only when it appears that construction of buildings on fill or elevation of buildings on pilings is impractical 8 methods of floodproofing the following measures are considered as appropriate to floodproofing and these and other measures should be considered by the city engineer when reviewing applications for actions related to floodproofing these measures should be designed to be consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation for the particular area flood velocities duration rate of rise hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces and other factors associated with the regulatory flood a anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement  b installation of watertight doors bulkheads and shutters or similar methods of construction to protect against water damage  c reinforcement of walls to resist water pressures  d use of paints membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of water   e addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation  f installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures  g construction of water supply and waste systems so as to prevent the entrance of floodwaters  h pumping facilities or comparable practices for subsurface drainage systems for buildings to relieve external foundation wall and basement flood pressures  i construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or floating debris  j installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm drains which will permit the drains to be closed to prevent backup of sewage and stormwater into the buildings or structures gravity drainage of basements may be eliminated by mechanical devices  k location of all electrical equipment circuits and installed electrical appliances in a manner which will ensure that they are not subject to flooding and to provide protection from inundation by the regulatory flood  and l location of any structural storage facilities for chemicals explosives buoyant materials flammable liquids or other toxic materials which will ensure that the facilities are situated at elevations above the height associated with the regulatory protection elevation or are adequately floodproofed to prevent flotation of storage containers or damage to storage containers which could result in the escape of toxic materials into floodwaters 9 report to zoning administrator or board of adjustment upon completion of review of applications for zoning permits or special exceptions the city engineer shall certify his findings to the zoning administrator or board of zoning appeals as appropriate and

classifications a description of classifications it is the general intent of this article to ensure a proper relationship between appropriate urban design and historic preservation considerations on the one hand and flexibility of design creativity on the other hand to that end five protection classifications are hereby created with the intent that each shall impose a different degree of regulation upon activities related to the intent of this article protection classifications are as enumerated in this subsection in descending order of regulatory control 1 landmark this classification shall be applied to buildings structures improvements or physical features which have historic architectural aesthetic social or cultural significance to the city the state the region or the nation this classification shall not be applied unless the feature has been in existence for at least 20 years this classification should be applied in order to protect such features from demolition encroachment removal to inappropriate sites or other adverse actions which would endanger those qualities of the feature which impart its value as a landmark it is anticipated that stringent control criteria would be applied for features given this classification 2 landmark district this classification is intended to be applied to either of two types of areas a to an area surrounding a landmark in order to protect the landmark  or b to an area not containing a landmark but which because of a grouping of structures or other features may be considered of substantial importance such that the district itself constitutes an outstanding and distinctive area worthy of protection it is not required that any criteria of age of structures be established it is anticipated that stringent control criteria would be applied within landmark districts 3 architectural conservation district this classification is intended to be applied to areas which constitute distinctive sections of the city by virtue of groupings of architectural features distinctive character of the district or distinctive function of the district this classification should be applied when the regulatory intent is to preserve conserve or enhance the character function or environment of the district as contrasted to preservation of specific structures it is anticipated that less stringent control criteria would be applied than for the landmark district 4 historic commercial district this classification is intended to be applied to areas which constitute distinctive sections of the city by virtue of groupings of buildings and structures which were constructed originally for commercial uses typically these buildings originally housed retail institutional office or manufacturing uses this classification should be applied when the regulatory intent is to preserve conserve or enhance the character function or environment of the district as contrasted to specific structures it is anticipated that control criteria equal in magnitude to that of the architectural conservation district would be applied it is anticipated that less stringent control criteria would be applied than for the landmark district 5 protection areas this classification is intended to be applied to areas which are less distinctively defined geographically visually or physically than landmark districts architectural conservation districts or historic commercial districts but which nevertheless constitute essential portions of areas which should be subject to urban design regulations this classification should be applied in areas where selective control of specified design characteristics and features is desired as a means of protecting the environs of districts which are distinctive in character or function it is anticipated that minimal control of selected characteristics would be applied in protection areas b procedure for designation prior to designation of any landmark landmark district architectural conservation district historic commercial district or protection area the ddrc shall submit a report to the city council recommending the location and boundaries of such designation the report shall in addition recommend general standards for urban design and historic preservation control and other regulatory criteria consistent with the purpose of this article

scope of responsibility  boundaries and jurisdiction  requirements for onsite stormwater systems enforcement methods and inspections these former sections derived from  cross reference stormwater management and sedimentation control ch 21 findings of fact the city council of columbia south carolina makes the following findings of fact 1 the professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the city properly assess and define the stormwater management problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities of the city 2 given the problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate enterprise accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city of columbia in concert with other water resource management programs 3 stormwater management is needed throughout the city of columbia intense urban development in most portions of the city has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydraulics of stormwater systems with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities a stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service charges should encompass the entirety of the city of columbia and the service charge rate structure should reflect the amount of impervious surfaces that exists on individual properties 4 the stormwater needs in the city of columbia include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities therefore render andor result in both service and benefit to individual properties property owners citizens and residents of the city and to properties property owners citizens and residents of the unincorporated city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses 5 the service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs systems and facilities and risk exposure it is not practical to allocate the cost of the citys stormwater management programs systems and facilities in direct and precise relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the longterm demands they impose on the citys stormwater programs systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits 6 the city of columbia presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed installed and acquired mechanisms over many years the future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and of future additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the city of columbia in concert with the management of other water resources in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs 7 the city council finds concludes and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and benefits throughout the city of columbia and the most equitable means to fund stormwater services in the city is service charges and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the city 8 the city council finds concludes and determines that a schedule of stormwater utility service charges based on the impervious area of each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities throughout the city such charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs including but not limited to allocations of other revenues available to the city special service fees special assessments of the city various taxes as allowed by law and other revenues as deemed appropriate by the city council 9 the city council finds that credits against stormwater utility service charges are an appropriate means of adjusting fees rates rentals charges fines and penalties in certain cases and should be granted for properties providing onsite or offsite services systems facilities activities easements or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of said property on the citys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities and that such credits should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities easements or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city engineer credits for onsite stormwater management systems and facilities shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the site credits should also be granted for activities which reduce the citys cost of public information and education about stormwater management and may include credits against stormwater service charges to public and private school systems credits for educational programs and other activities related to stormwater management provided by public and private schools shall be based on the citys avoided costs as determined by the city engineer and not on the cost of the educational programs or other activities 10 the city council finds that the impervious area on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and that the impervious area of each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge 11 the city council finds that it is imperative that all revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services inclusive of stormwater quality issues and requirements along with stormwater public education and relations and stormwater management systems and facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes and directs that such revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the stormwater management utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs debt service of bonds for stormwater management purposes and other appropriate uses as determined by the city council    authority this article may be cited as the stormwater management utility the city of columbia and is
