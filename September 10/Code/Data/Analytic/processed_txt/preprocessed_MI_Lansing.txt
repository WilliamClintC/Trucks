transportation engineer andy kilpatrick housing director martell armstrong information technology director collin boyce neighborhoods and citizen engagement director andi crawford foreward most communities when recodifying their ordinances simply hand over the old several boxes of paper to a codifier and wait for the end result while less burdensome this method can leave people with less knowledge than they had before about the laws that govern the city lansing did it the hard way every chapter of the old reviewed and many were simply thrown out each department provided input into the ordinances with which they worked every day were introduced as individual ordinances and the council conducted at least one public hearing on each the mayor and council discussed all of the ordinances that were rewritten and adopted the result was a molding of a single document that was tailored to the expressed needs and desires of the people of lansing it has been twentynine years since the last rewritten obviously in that time laws became antiquated outmoded cumbersome and unenforceable like snowflakes no two communities are alike doing it the hard way however has taken more than two years of solid work each chapter each page and virtually each word has been reviewed and rewritten for this immense amount of work some extraordinary people put in tremendous hours and deserve special thanks these were the people who worked on every ordinance and kept the project organized and moving ron onufer  who coordinated the project and kept the paperwork flowing herb davidson  who went over each of the drafts to make sure we had everything included karen tury  who kept the minutes of the general services committee meetings sometimes six pages of amendments in one meeting mary pierce and emily salmons  who entered the 1250 page the computer and typed redraft after redraft al knot  city attorney who did the drafting and research of the documents for the councils view vickie bell  who represented the city clerks office and researched license and permit procedures this is not an all inclusive list and the others who put in the hours to make this possible are listed separately my special thanks to the councilmembers who served on the general services committee during the past two years alfreda schmidt charles creamer patrick lindemann lou adado and james blair they all contributed a great deal during some very long meetings finally my thanks to mayor terry mckane who made this project a priority and gave unhesitatingly of city staffs time to make this document possible the laws of a community reflect that communitys priorities and commitments as the priorities change so too must the law failing to do so can leave a community frustrated and unable to respond effectively to the needs of the citizenry this recodification is not an end but only a continuing step and we are proud to present it to the people of the city of lansing sincerely s sidney p

marshal recodification as a whole rita bauman city clerk ruth ward deputy city clerk editors note the numbering system used in these codified ordinances is consistent with the best accepted practice for codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal the section number appears to the right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01 with this numbering system the codified ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly codes titles and chapters are for the most part initially evennumbered thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66004 and precede 66005 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code subsections without histories or with the word adopting  at the end thereof are or contain new matter ordained by the adopting enacts these codified ordinances the comparative is included to show the disposition of every ordinance and resolution included in these codified ordinances it

standardized uniform form of franchise agreement established by the michigan public service commission mpsc this form includes the right to use the public rightofway to provide such service but does not contain rightofway management and related provisions b telecommunications providers who obtain such a standardized uniform form of franchise agreement will usually have a city permit issued pursuant to the metro act allowing them to construct and maintain their telecommunications facilities in the public rightofway such metro act permits set forth the terms and conditions for such rightofway usage standard forms for such permits were agreed to in a collaborative process between municipalities and providers that was initiated by the mpsc and such standard forms have since been approved by the legislature and the mpsc c because telecommunications providers typically provide video services over combined video and telecommunications facilities metro act permits generally provide adequate public rightofway protections for the city and the public when such providers are providing video services d other video service providers in particular new providers or existing

tobacco products it is hereby found and declared that 1 outdoor advertisements are a unique and distinguishable medium of advertising which subjects the general public to involuntary and unavoidable forms of solicitation as the supreme court recognized in packer corporation v utah 285 us 1051932 by citing with approval the following excerpt from the opinion of the utah supreme court advertisements of this sort are constantly before the eyes of observers on the streets  to be seen without the exercise of choice or volition on their part other forms of advertising are ordinarily seen as a matter of choice on the part of the observer the young people as well as the adults have the message of the billboard thrust upon them by all the arts and devices that skill can produce in the case of newspapers and magazines there must be some seeking by the one who is to see and read the advertisement the radio can be turned off but not so the billboard  these distinctions clearly place this kind of advertisement in a position to be classified so that regulations or prohibitions may be imposed upon all within the class this is impossible with respect to newspapers and magazines 2 the supreme court and other courts have recognized the positive relationship between advertising and consumption as regards a variety of goods and services such as electricity see central hudson gas & elec v pub serv commn 447 us 557 569 1980 there is an immediate connection between advertising and demand for electricity central hudson would not contest the advertising ban unless it believed that promotion would increase its sale gambling see posades de puerto rico assoc v tourism co of puerto rico 478 us 328 34142 1986 the puerto rico legislature obviously believed when it enacted the advertising restrictions at issue here that advertising of casino gambling aimed at the residents of puerto rico would serve to increase the demand for the product advertised we think the legislatures belief is a reasonable one   cigarettes see capital broadcasting co v mitchell 33 f supp 582586 ddc 1971 threejudge court noting close relationship between cigarette commercials broadcast on the

daily smoker by age 1412 4 the consumption of tobacco by minors is illegal in the city of lansing 5 despite the illegality of tobacco consumption the use of tobacco is prevalent among city of lansing

prevalent and disproportionately higher than tobacco billboard advertising in the remainder of ingham county 8 the vast majority of lansing billboards with the exception of those located on highways are located on arterials used by lansing school children for school travel 9 tobacco billboard advertising inevitably results in increased illegal tobacco consumption by lansing youth 10 due to the prevalence of tobacco billboard advertising in lansing as well as the location of lansing schools accessible by major arterials it is impossible for lansing youth to avoid tobacco billboard exposure
