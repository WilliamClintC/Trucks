a purpose and policy 1 it is hereby found that the streams creeks and waterways of the borough are subject to recurring flooding that such flooding damages and endangers public and private property and facilities that this condition is aggravated by developments and encroachments in the floodplain and that the most appropriate method of alleviating such condition is of such developments and encroachments it is therefore determined that the special and paramount public interest in the floodplain justifies the regulation of property located therein as provided in this chapter which is in the exercise of the police power of the municipality for the protection of the persons and property of its inhabitants and for the preservation of the public health safety and general welfare 2 the intent of this chapter shall be to protect the areas of the floodplain subject to and necessary for the containment of floodwaters and to permit and encourage the retention of open space land uses

requirements certain restrictions made necessary for flood prone areas to promote the general health welfare and safety of the borough 2 to prevent the erection of structures in areas unfit for human usage by reason of danger from flooding 3 to minimize danger to public health by protecting the quality of surface and subsurface water supplies adjacent to and underlying flood hazard areas and promoting safe and sanitary drainage 4 to permit only those uses which can be appropriately located in the floodplain as herein defined and which will not impede the flow or storage of floodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life property at above or below their locations along the floodplains 5 to provide sufficient drainage courses to carry abnormal flows of stormwater in periods of heavy precipitation 6 to protect adjacent landowners and those both upstream and downstream from damages resulting from development within a floodplain and the consequent construction or increase in flow of floodwaters 7 to protect the entire borough from individual uses of land which may have an effect upon subsequent expenditures for public works  23 adopting ordinance  23 ao499 and disaster relief and adversely affect the economic wellbeing of the borough 8 to maintain undisturbed the ecological balance between those natural systems and elements including wildlife vegetation and marine life dependent upon watercourse and water areas 9 to protect other municipalities within the same watershed from the impact of improper development and the consequent increased potential for flooding 10 to require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities be constructed so as to be protected from flood damage in accordance with the purpose and requirements of the national flood
