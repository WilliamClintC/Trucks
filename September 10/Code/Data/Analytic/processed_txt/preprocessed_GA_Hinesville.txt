is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured for this reason it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city relies on as a source of public water groundwater resources are contained within aquifers which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface these aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones known as groundwater recharge areas groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant recharge areas it is therefore necessary to ensure that pollution threats are minimized c objectives the objectives of this division are as follows 1 protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas  2 protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development  and 3 protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality    6152000  i 142001 definitions aquifer means any stratum layer of sedimentary rock or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or

utility which shall be responsible for stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the city and which shall provide for the management protection control regulation use and enhancement of the citys stormwater management services systems and facilities  1272006 purpose the city is authorized by the state constitution including without limitation paragraphs ii and iiia6 thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the city which services systems and facilities contribute to the protection and preservation of the public health safety and welfare and protection of the natural resources of the city of hinesville the federal clean water act as amended by the water quality act of 1987 33 usc 1251 et seq other amendments and rules promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency pursuant to the act place increased emphasis on the role of local governments in developing implementing conducting and making available to its citizens and property owners stormwater management services which address water quality and volume impacts of stormwater runoff the city council has determined that development in the city to date and development in the future has created and will continue to create additional needs for stormwater management services systems and facilities within the city the city has engaged a consultant to perform a stormwater utility feasibility study of the citys stormwater management needs and the alternatives available to the city for dealing with stormwater management and has received reviewed and considered the results of the consultants analyses which identify stormwater management needs propose strategic program goals and priorities estimate the cost of stormwater management services systems and facilities examine reasonable charges by the city for providing such services and facilities and project the rate base available within the city to support such costs the city council finds and concludes from the stormwater utility feasibility study that it would be desirable to provide for additional stormwater management services systems and facilities within the city the city council finds and concludes from the stormwater utility feasibility study that a fair and equitable rate structure for those owners of developed property in the city receiving the benefits of stormwater management services systems and facilities the proceeds of which will be dedicated to the city stormwater utility for carrying out its purposes will be essential if the city is to provide the level of stormwater management services systems and facilities that would be desirable to meet the existing and future stormwater management needs of the city  1272006 findings the city council makes the following findings of fact 1 the city is authorized by the state constitution including without limitation paragraphs ii and iiia6 thereof and state law to provide stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the city 2 the management of stormwater and other surface water discharges within and beyond the city is a matter that affects the health safety and welfare of all residents and businesses in the city 3 improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands threaten to potentially damage businesses and residences and other facilities and may create environmental damage to the rivers streams and other bodies of water within and adjacent to the city 4 a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas 5 failure to effectively manage stormwater affects the operations of sanitary sewer operated by the city by among other things increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system 6 failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels of treatment requirements being imposed on the citys wastewater treatment facilities 7 the federal clean water act as amended by the water quality act of 1987 33 usc 1251 et seq the act and rules promulgated by the united states environmental protection agency pursuant to the act imposed by regulatory obligations of its national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit require the city to reduce pollution in its stormwater discharge and increase water quality to the maximum extent practicable 8 proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing and future development in the city the city has two rivers and streams listed as impaired waters by the georgia department of natural resources environmental protection division or other appropriate authorities pursuant to d of the act 9 compliance with the regulatory obligations of the npdes permit will substantially increase the cost of stormwater management above that which is currently spent for drainage and flood control 10 the cost of operating and maintaining the city stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs replacements improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system 11 in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the public the city hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility and establish rates for stormwater management services 12 in promulgating the regulations contained in this section the city is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution of the state of georgia and the charter of the city to provide for stormwater collection and disposal ga const art ix  ii  iiia6 13 the city fully incorporates by reference into these findings the stormwater utility feasibility study said document is on file in the office of the city manager 14 the stormwater utility feasibility study conducted on behalf of and submitted to the city assesses and defines the stormwater management issues needs goals program priorities and operational opportunities of the city 15 given the issues needs goals priorities and operational opportunities identified in the stormwater utility feasibility study submitted to the city the city determines to establish a stormwater utility within the city that is dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater management services systems and facilities in the city in concert with other water resource management programs 16 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city development in the city has altered the natural hydrology with some natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities even areas of the city that remain less densely developed and rural in character with natural stormwater drainage predominating demand services along roads where ditches and culverts have been installed as a result stormwater management services systems and facilities needs apply to all areas of the city 17 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare provision of stormwater management services systems facilities and regulation of their use renders andor results in both service and benefit to individual properties property owners citizens and residents of city and to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the stormwater utility feasibility study 18 the service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management services systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed upon the stormwater management services systems and facilities and risk exposure it is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of properties in proportion to the longterm demands the properties owned impose on the citys stormwater management services systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof 19 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed installed and acquired mechanisms over many years the future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and of future additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance the stormwater management systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management and regulation of other water resources in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management services systems and facilities 20 a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the city and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services systems and facilities in the city management charges user fees and other mechanisms as described more fully herein 21 a schedule of stormwater utility management charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the city such charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs including but not limited to special service fees special assessments use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue as deemed appropriate by the city council 22 the existence of privately owned and maintained onsite or offsite systems facilities activities or assets which significantly reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the citys stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city and as set forth herein 23 the area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating periodic stormwater management charges 24 in addition to impervious area the amount and types of pollutants that are carried by stormwater runoff is closely tied to the use of the property sampling of stormwater runoff from across the united states has demonstrated that the runoff from the more heavily used property such as commercial and industrial developments contain greater quantities of pollutants than less intensely developed residential properties the water quality component of the citys stormwater program will concentrate more heavily in those areas where the land use of the properties generates the greatest quantity of pollutants which may be reflected in the stormwater quality charge of those properties 25 it is imperative that the proceeds from all charges for stormwater management services systems and facilities together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services systems and facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes and the council directs that such proceeds of charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be disbursed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes  1272006 definitions a generally the following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this chapter unless otherwise specifically stated or where the

drug trafficking among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol commercial nudity in general and cinematographic

disorderly conduct public indecency prostitution and drug trafficking and drug use among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in

behavior described in this section and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of similar establishments in particular areas 4 the city therefore finds that to promote the health welfare

footnotes  2  editors note i adopted  amended article viii in its entirety to read as herein set out formerly article viii pertained to similar subject matter and derived from i1at adopted  and ia b adopted  in general a findings and purpose 1 the city of hinesville finds that signs and advertising are proper and necessary uses of private property are a means of personal free expression are a necessary component of a commercial environment and constitute a legitimate business enterprise as such signs are entitled to the protection of the law in the absence of regulation however the number of signs tends to proliferate with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares the manner of the erection location and maintenance of signs affects the public health safety morals and welfare of the citizens of hinesville the safety of motorists pedestrians cyclists and other users of the public streets is affected by the number size location lighting and movement of signs that divert the attention of drivers the size and location of signs may if uncontrolled constitute an obstacle to effective firefighting techniques competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises uncontrolled and unlimited signs may degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism visitation and permanent economic growth the city of hinesville finds further that regulation of signs is consistent with the citys efforts to revitalize its central business district its downtown development area and its urban redevelopment area 2 regulation of the size height number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses to enhance the business and economy of the city to protect the public investment in the streets and highways to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas to promote industry and commerce to eliminate visual clutter and blight to provide an aesthetically appealing environment and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of advertising for the benefit of all the citys citizens the purpose of the mayor and city council in enacting these sign regulations is to create a comprehensive and balanced system of sign control that accommodates both the need for a well maintained safe and attractive community and the need for effective business identification advertising and communication 3 regulation of the changeable electronic variable message signs have been shown to create possible threats to public safety these signs allow operators to change content from remote location in a matter of seconds such signs are erected for the purpose of trying to hold the attention of motorists by changing messages and pictures for short durations using a series of bright colorful images produced mainly via led light emitting diode technologies brightly lit signs that change messages every few seconds compel motorists to notice them and lure the attention of motorists away from what is happening on the road and onto the sign such signs pose public safety threats because if they attract a motorists attention the motorist will look at the sign and not at the road changeable electronic variable message signs are also a threat to public safety because of their brightness making them visible from great distances due to their nature of brightness and changing displays changeable electronic variable message signs are more distracting than signs which do not vary the message some such signs could if unregulated have the appearance of large plasmascreen televisions an electronic led display contains brightlylit text and graphics which can bee seen from hundreds of feet away drawing the attention of everyone within view unless otherwise regulated such displays can be extremely bright since they are designed to be visible in bright sunlight and at night furthermore the human eye is drawn to them far more strongly than to traditional illuminated signs such electronic led displays can be seen from as far away as sixtenths of a mile making them distracting it takes a minimum of six seconds to comprehend the message on an electronic sign which is three times the safe period for driver distraction for these reasons it is the intent of the city council to allow changeable electronic variable signs subject to acceptable criteria 4 scope this article is adopted to serve substantial governmental interests of correcting and avoiding multiple problems that would occur without the regulation of signs the regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in the article it is not the intent of this article to regulate the content of signs but only their composition type location distance from rightofway height size illumination and in some cases the duration they may be displayed or other noncontent based restrictions implied in this article it is not the intent of this article to foreclose important and distinct mediums of expression for political religious or personal messages on any sign permitted to be erected by this article these regulations shall not be construed as limiting the message content of any sign 5 the citys aim in regulating signage in the city is directed primarily toward commercial speech as businesses are by far the most frequent users of signs in hinesville the city recognizes the rights of property owners and occupants outside commercial areas of the city to signage of their choosing and further recognizes that courts require protection of all individuals rights to erect signs as an inexpensive and effective means of communicating ideas however it is not the intention of the city to regulate any and all possible means of expressing ideas the citys regulatory structure for signs is therefore directed to those devices traditionally identifiable as signs and is not intended to reach holiday decorations architectural elements of buildings flags works of art or other physical manifestations of concepts unrelated to traditional signage through its sign ordinance the city is further not attempting to regulate traditional free speech activities such as parading picketing or handbilling that do not involve the physical installation of signs on property 6 the city has chosen to exempt from permitting requirements certain minor signs that are primarily safety oriented studies have shown for instance that posting of alarm company signs on residential property has a substantial detrimental effect on residential burglaries directional signs are utilized to move vehicular traffic safely in and out of business driveways in an expeditious manner eliminating or vastly reducing the number of traffic accidents that might otherwise result from unregulated movements posting of address numerals is absolutely essential to rapid public safety response in event of emergency and is a service to persons trying to locate unfamiliar properties it is the citys considered judgment that such signs directly facilitate the public safety and have little or no impact on expressive speech b authority this
