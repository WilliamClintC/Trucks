charged based on the average monthly water consumption awc which is based on the average monthly water consumption per user billed during the sewer rate calculation period january  if the water consumption for any month during the awc calculation period is less than 2000 gallons the calculation amount used will be 2000 gallons if the water consumption for any month during the awc calculation period is over 2000 gallons the actual water consumption will be used in the awc calculation process the awc is multiplied by the rate per 1000 gallons kgal for that class of property residential or nonresidential to calculate the monthly sewer charge sewer rate schedule the monthly sewer charge is calculated by multiplying the awc times the rate per customer category type of customer 2019 charge

compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  iii provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  iv not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and v have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial

revised production rate the city manager must reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and iv continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 8102b4ai wmc so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the city manager i will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  ii upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and iii may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily

due to activities of the industrial user this authorization is subject to the following conditions a the waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater b the monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the permit but in no case longer than five years the user must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent control mechanism c in making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present the industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facilitys process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes d the request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with subsection 8101d2 wmc and include the certification statement in subsection 8106n1 wmc e nondetectable sample results may only be used as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the epa approved method from 40 cfr

reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the city manager for three years after expiration of the waiver g upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the users permit by the city manager the industrial user must certify on each report with the statement in subsection 8106n3 wmc that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the industrial user h in the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present based on changes that occur in the users operations the user must immediately notify the city manager and comply with the monitoring requirements of subsection 8106d1 wmc or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the city manager i this provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard 3 all periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection 8106n1 wmc 4 all wastewater samples must be representative of the users discharge wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times the failure of a user to keep its monitoring

reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 for the purposes of this section a bypass shall mean the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage shall mean substantial physical

manager may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours 4 bypass a bypass is prohibited and the city may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and iii the user submitted notices as required
