which will assist finance department personnel in the determination of the amounts of cash available for investment the time period for which the funds may be invested with a reasonable level of confidence and a measure of the volatility of specific forecasts which will allow viable determination of the required liquidity which must characterize the specific investments 2 the design and implementation of appropriate revenue acceleration programs aimed at enhancing the speed at which monies are collected and deposited 3 the design and implementation of suitable controlled disbursement programs which will ensure that city expenses are met in a timely manner but not in such a way as to jeopardize the earning capacity of the citys cash management portfolio springs city code notes72 investment policies and procedures ro 2012    4 the utilization of modern and efficient techniques for the physical movement of money taking advantage of the technological and operational procedures

intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs not for speculation but for investment considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived imposes a wide variety of responsibilities upon the department of finance these responsibilities include but are not limited to the need for prudence and care in the selection of appropriate investment securities  the need for rational criteria for the selection of financial institutions and securities dealers with whom the city conducts business  and a distinct concentration upon the maximization of investment yield within the parameters of the other listed responsibilities to meet these responsibilities the department of finance has established the following policies and procedures for cash investment 1 investment instruments the director of finance or designee shall invest the temporarily idle funds of the city in those investment instruments which are listed below a fullycollateralized certificates of deposit issued by qualified commercial banks and savings and loan associations located within the state the term qualified is explained more fully in 2 hereof b deposits in the states local government investment pool only if authorized by state statutes c direct obligations of the united states government including such instruments as treasury bills treasury notes and treasury bonds and appendices notes73 d other direct obligations while fully guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the united states government enjoy less active secondary markets than the more traditional bills notes and bonds therefore the finance department will currently refrain from purchasing such instruments as sba loans aid bonds stripped treasury bonds etc unless special circumstances prevail which suggest their appropriate use for specific investments the special circumstances will be fully documented at the time of their purchase and the city council will be notified e obligations of us government agencies including such instruments as federal home loan bank bonds government national mortgage association bonds or a variety of federal farm credit bonds f purchases of the direct or agency securities mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 above under the terms of a repurchase agreement which meets the procedures established in part c of this in no event will any investment vehicle be selected and utilized until the director of finance is fully convinced that departmental personnel have full familiarity with the nature and nuances of the specific investment vehicle furthermore the director of finance will endeavor to make available whatever professional training is necessary to assist departmental personnel in the performance of their cash management duties and responsibilities h generally the city will only invest in money market instruments which are defined as very credit worthy highly liquid investments with maturities of one year or less although there may be certain circumstances in which longerterm securities are utilized such as investments of longterm sinking fund contributions or maturitymatched construction funds the general use of longterm securities shall be avoided such instruments are generally inappropriate to the citys cash management operations since the purchase of such securities infers certain level of speculation given the significant market risks which characterize longterm investments 2 criteria for selection of financial intermediaries although the citys policies for the purchase of investment securities are designed to ensure complete safety accompanied by appropriate liquidity and competitive yields the providers of such securities must also meet specific financial and operational standards deposits in commercial banks and savings and loan associations whether they be time deposits demand deposits or deposits in springs city code notes74 special interestbearing accounts now supernow etc shall only be made in banks which qualify to accept publicsector deposits which are protected under the terms of rsmo however certain sweep or automatic repo accounts and certain funds held under the terms of a trust agreement arrangement may not be protected under the provisions of rsmo furthermore the city has no desire to test such program as fdic or fslic insurance nor does it wish to have to establish its legal right to securities held by financiallyinsolvent brokers or securities dealers there are a sufficiently large number of financial institutions and securities dealers which are of impeccable financial standing as a result the city does not choose to do business with marginal or financiallyweak institutions therefor financial intermediaries which conduct business with the city of excelsior springs shall be subject to the following types of selection criteria a commercial banks deposits of city monies in commercial banks may only be made with institutions which possess the overall financial strength capitalization and liquidity to reasonably ensure the safety and availability of such monies to assess the overall financial strength of potential depositories the city will utilize thirdparty rating agencies to perform periodic reviews of various commercial banks relying upon their reports to determine the appropriateness of the depository currently the city uses the services of prudent man analysis inc pma to rate the strength of the commercial banks with which the city does business inasmuch as pma utilizes overall ratings of one 1 5 one 1 being strongest five 5 being weakest the citys current policy is to seek depositories with a pma rating of one 1 or two 2 banks with ratings of three 3 shall be eligible to serve as a depository but must be periodically and substantively reviewed banks rated in the four 4 or five 5 category will not qualify to receive city monies b savings and loan associations deposits of city monies in savings and loan associations shall be subject to the same rating criteria which are applied to commercial banks their acceptability as depositories will be judged on the thirdparty ratings of such organizations as pma or its counterparts c securities dealers there are currently thirtysix 36 major investment banking firms which are listed by the market reports division of the federal reserve bank of new york as and appendices notes75 the thirtysix 36 primary securities dealers these dealers are unique within the united states government securities industry in that they both report and are regulated in an industry which is typically nonreporting and unregulated included on this blue chip list are major securities firms prudentialbache dean witter reynolds merrill lynch smith barney etc and some of the worlds largest banks bank of america citibank manufacturers hanover northern trust etc current department of finance policy is to restrict transactions relating to the purchase and sale of us government securities to this list of primary securities dealers such policy therefor will preclude the city from doing business with other brokers and dealers whose financial strength and operational capabilities cannot be confidently determined given the absence of reporting and regulation requirements this policy may seem unduly restrictive however the city policy is to err on the side of prudence rather than accept event the smallest risk of loss of principal or interest 3 procedures for the delivery and possession of securities it provides insufficient protection for the city to simply limit its cash investments to those listed in a of this ensure total protection the city has established delivery and possession procedures which will be followed in every case specifically a all ownership of securities shall be evidenced by an acceptable safekeeping receipt issued by a thirdparty financial institution which is acceptable to the city or by a safekeeping receipt from the federal reserve bank b all investment or divestment transactions will be implemented on a delivery vs payment or payment vs delivery basis in the absence of acceptable delivery the city will refuse to enter the transaction c repurchase agreements will meet the aforementioned delivery criteria and will be accompanied by an acceptable haircut ie excess of market value of securities over principal amount of investment furthermore securities purchased under the terms of a repurchase agreement shall generally have maturity dates of ten 10 years or less and shall be wirable instruments us federal reserve system d from time to time the city may choose to reverse certain of its portfolio securities under the terms of a reverse springs city code notes76 reserved editors note former airports containing was repealed 9182017 by  1 of repurchase agreement however this authority shall be severely restricted the primary rationale for reversing is to provide shortterm liquidity which is less costly than permanent liquidation of a portfolio security this method can be utilized to temporarily liquidate many types of securities including cds us government obligations us agency obligations etc in the case of local cds a temporary reverse or reverse to maturity may allow the city to legally avoid any early withdrawal penalties thereby preserving the citys investment capital in the case of government or agency securities a temporary reverse may allow the city to avoid liquidation of a desirable instrument in a disadvantageous marketplace however the city will not utilize reverse as a tool to effect margined purchases of investment securities nor as an action which will essentially  disguise or cover up unrecognized portfolio losses finally the city will not utilize reverses to engage in any types of speculative investment transactions e all wire transactions required to implement the aforementioned purchase and sale transactions shall be supported by written instructions to the citys bank unless the timely preparation of such written instructions would hinder the orderly completion of the transaction itself in such cases the city will prepare followup letters confirming the oral typically telephonic instructions and forward such written instructions to the bank without undue delay the finance department will from time to time recommend to the governing body various financing opportunities which should be of ultimate financial and operational benefit to the city and its taxpayers the department will constantly monitor the citys existing and potential financing alternatives to ensure that full advantage is being taken of the special taxexempt municipal financing authority the city and appendices notes77 taxation cross

character but of such a nature that the operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities  and 3 uses which are of a short duration and short range impact on the community b authorization special uses may be authorized only by the city council provided that no application for a special use shall be acted upon by the city council
