performed a temporary or permanent sediment basin providing 3600 cubic feet of storage per acre drained or equivalent control measures must be provided where attainable until final stabilization of the site when computing the number of acres draining to a common location it is not necessary to include flows from offsite areas and flows from onsite areas that are either undisturbed or have undergone final stabilization where such flows are diverted around both the disturbed areas and the sediment basin in determining whether a sediment basin is attainable the operators may consider such factors as site soils slope available area onsite etc in any event the operator must consider public safety especially as it relates to children as a design factor for the sediment basin and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would preclude a safe design ii drainage locations which serve 10 or more disturbed acres at one time and where temporary sediment basins or equivalent controls are not attainable smaller sediment basins andor sediment traps should be used at a minimum silt fence vegetative buffer strips or equivalent sediment controls are
