marijuana and dangerous products   findings intent and purpose a the city finds that synthetic marijuana consisting of plant or other material treated with chemicals or other substances that have not been approved for human consumption is being marketed and sold as herbal incense and is being used in the same manner and for the same purposes as marijuana with that use having become increasingly popular particularly among teens and young adults b the city further finds based on information and reports from poison control centers hospitals emergency room doctors and police agencies that individuals who use synthetic marijuana experience dangerous side effects including convulsions tremors seizures hallucinations unconsciousness anxiety attacks dangerously elevated heart rates increased blood pressure vomiting and disorientation evidencing that these herbal incense products are harmful if consumed and present an imminent and significant public health danger to persons consuming such products and other persons coming in contact with them c the city further finds that notwithstanding the high potential for abuse and lack of any accepted medical use the ability of the state to prohibit all forms of synthetic marijuana as a controlled substance has been frustrated due to the changing nature of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process d the city further finds that in addition to synthetic marijuana there may be other products or materials containing chemicals or substances that while not approved for human consumption are or may be marketed and sold in a form that allows for such consumption and which upon consumption may result in the same serious side effects and public health dangers as synthetic marijuana e based on these findings this ordinance

shall study the sign proposal giving consideration to any extraordinary circumstances such as those listed below that would cause practical difficulty in complying with the sign standards the presence of any of the circumstances listed may be sufficient to justify granting a variance 2 in granting or denying a variance the zoning board of appeals shall state the grounds and findings upon which it justifies granting or denying the variance based on the following criteria i permitted signage could not be easily seen by passing motorists due to the configuration of existing buildings trees or other obstructions ii permitted signage could not be seen by passing motorists in sufficient time to permit safe deceleration and exit in determining whether such circumstances exist the zoning board of appeals shall consider the width of the road the number of moving lanes the volume of traffic and speed limits iii existing signs on nearby parcels would substantially reduce the visibility or identification impact of a conforming sign on the subject parcel iv construction of a conforming sign would require removal or severe alteration to natural features on the parcel such as but not limited to removal of trees alteration of the natural topography filling of wetlands or obstruction of a natural drainage course v construction of a conforming sign would obstruct the vision of motorists or otherwise endanger the health or safety of passersby vi variance from certain sign regulations would be offset by increased building setback increased landscaping or other such enhancements so that the net effect is an improvement in appearance of the parcel compared to the result that would be otherwise achieved with construction of a conforming sign vii a sign which exceeds the permitted height or area standards of this chapter would be more appropriate in scale because of the large size or frontage of the parcel or building     substitution clause notwithstanding any provision standard or regulation in this chapter to the contrary a noncommercial message may be substituted in whole or in part for any commercial message on any sign permitted
