is received from a potential developer the master plans as adopted by the mayor and council become the first instrument used by staff to evaluate the request if the requested extension is a part of the master plans the decision for extension is made based on the funds available for implementation of the master plans in setting priorities for allocating money for this implementation the realities of development will play an important role tap fees and user surcharges may be used to calculate a payback on the investment if the requested extension is not a part of the water or sewer master plans the citys engineering division shall review the request to determine the effect of the extension on the water distribution or sewer collection systems and ultimately on the master plans if it is determined that the proposed line would serve a greater purpose than simply serving the proposed development the master plans may be amended to include proposed extension implementation would then follow as previously presented should the extension be determined to have no effect on the master plans the responsibility for the extension could rest primarily with the developer however various

city of north augusta south carolina hereby finds and determines a the city of north augusta south carolina the city is an incorporated municipality located in aiken and edgefield counties south carolina and as such possesses all powers granted to municipalities by the constitution and the laws of the state of south carolina including the powers enumerated in sc 2005 supp relating to regulating streets markets and public health b numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke also known as environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart disease stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer the national cancer institute has determined that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to sixtyfive thousand 65000 americans annually national cancer institute nci health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke the report of the california environmental protection agency smoking and tobacco control monograph 10 bethesda md national institutes of health national cancer institute nci august 1999 the surgeon general has declared that 1 secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in nonsmokers exposed to smoke  2 children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for sudden death syndrome acute respiratory infections ear problems and more severe asthma  3 adults exposed to secondary smoke have a higher risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer  4 there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke  and 5 separating smoking and nonsmoking sections of indoor areas does not sufficiently remove the threats of secondhand smoke in enclosed areas c a significant amount of secondhand smoke

diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke the high price of cigarette smoking business and health 158 supplement a 69 august 1997 e certain outdoor events such as parades festivals and other public gatherings result in nonsmokers finding themselves in close proximity to persons who are smoking which can be reasonably seen to have the same effects of exposure as when nonsmokers are exposed to smoke in the same enclosed space lighted cigarettes cigars and pipes of people standing or sitting in close proximity have the potential of burning those with whom they inadvertently come into direct contact and making the air quality and peaceful enjoyment of outdoor events unreasonably restricted for nonsmokers f when there is a presence of secondhand smoke in enclosed spaces or in outside areas where there is a public gathering resulting in people being in close proximity in places that are otherwise open to the public at large inevitably results in persons who do not smoke being forced to bear unwarranted health risks and inappropriate deprivation of peaceful enjoyment of the premises to which they have been invited or permitted to enter even when steps have been taken to separate smoking and nonsmoking areas within the confined space g the city recognizes that smoke creates a danger to the health and safety of the public at large and that in order to protect the

priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city in concert with other water resource management programs 3 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community 4 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders andor results in both service and benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analysis the service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and risk exposure 5 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by the city and of additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in the city in concert with the management of other water resources in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management programs operating and capital investment needs 6 the city council finds concludes and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in the city 7 an equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges for all properties within the city that is related to costs associated with the stormwater management services within the city the schedule of service charges can be augmented by other funding sources as may be determined by city council 8 impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and associated costs throughout the city and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits 9 a service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems and operations can effectively reduce the utilitys burden of stormwater quantity andor quality control requirements 10 service charge credits may be appropriate when public information and education about stormwater management is provided by the public school system thus reducing the utilitys cost of public education i 3402  ii 5602 establishment of a stormwater utility in accordance with section 4814120 of the laws of south carolina there is hereby established a stormwater utility within the city which shall be responsible for stormwater management throughout the citys corporate limits and shall provide for the management protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities i 3402 definitions credit a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater service charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational onsite stormwater system facility service or activity that reduces the stormwater utilitys costs credits for onsite stormwater systems should be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the site customers of the stormwater utility customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons properties and entities served by andor benefiting from the utilitys acquisitions management maintenance extension and improvement of the public stormwater management systems and facilities and regulation of public and private stormwater systems facilities and activities related thereto and persons properties and entities which will ultimately be served or benefited as a result of the stormwater management program development intensity factor dif the ratio of a developed propertys runoff coefficient c to the standard residential units runoff coefficient c a development intensity factor dif shall be determined by calculating an average runoff coefficient c from several similar uses within each classification dividing the calculated c value by the eru c value of 035 derives the dif developed property land altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than two hundred 200 square feet of impervious surface as defined in this chapter equivalent residential unit eru the median average impervious surface of residential properties in the city erus shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater service charges to all properties within the city one eru is onethird  13  acre of developed land with a runoff coefficient c of 035 hydrologic response the hydrologic response of a property is the manner and means whereby stormwater collects remains infiltrates andor is conveyed from a property it is dependent on several factors including but not limited to the presence of impervious area the size shape topographic vegetative and geologic conditions of a property antecedent moisture conditions and groundwater conditions on a property impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil as it entered in natural conditions prior to development common impervious areas include but are not limited to rooftops sidewalks walkways patio areas driveways parking lots storage areas compacted gravel and solid surfaces awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development nonresidential properties developed nonresidential properties including but not limited to commercial and office buildings industrial and manufacturing buildings storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces parking lots churches public and private schools and universities research stations hospitals convalescent centers assisted living facilities and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces residential properties 1 singlefamily residential properties developed land whereon one or two 2 residential dwelling units are located on one platted lot including but not limited to attached or unattached singlefamily homes duplexes mobile homes manufactured homes condominiums or townhouses 2 multifamily residential properties developed land whereon three 3 or more residential dwelling units are located on one platted lot including but not limited to apartment complexes retirement centers and other structures in which multiple persons or family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside runoff coefficient c the proportion of rainfall volume that runs off an area also known as the c factor stormwater management service charges the periodic rate fee or charge applicable to a parcel of developed land the charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the city stormwater utility service charges are based on measurable parameters that influence the stormwater utilitys cost of providing services and facilities with the most important factor being the amount of impervious area on each parcel the use of impervious areas as a service charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics use of ranges or rounding up or down to a consistent numerical interval or the use of flatrate charges for one or more classes of similarlysituated properties whose impact on the stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent stormwater service charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management of that property including but not limited to charges for site and development plan review inspection of development projects and onsite stormwater control systems stormwater system connections and enhanced levels of stormwater services above those normally provided by the city stormwater management system stormwater management systems address the issues of drainage management flooding and environmental quality pollution erosion and sedimentation of receiving rivers streams creeks lakes ponds and reservoirs maintenance regulation and funding of plants works instrumentalities and properties used or useful in the collection retention detention and treatment of stormwater or surface water drainage undeveloped properties land in its unaltered natural state or which has been modified to such minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural state shall be deemed undeveloped undeveloped land shall have no pavement asphalt or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that would prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect concentrate or flow in a manner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural state i 3402

need to make efficient use of the limited and valuable water resource under its stewardship in order to protect the publics health and safety and environmental integrity the objective of this drought response plan is to establish authority policy and procedure by which the city will take the proper actions to manage water demand during a droughtrelated shortage this article satisfies the requirements of the drought response act of 2000 laws of south carolina 197  492310 et seq as amended and has the goal of achieving the greatest public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use sanitation and fire protection and of allocating water for other purposes in an equitable manner this article outlines the actions to be taken for the conservation of water supplied by the city during times of water shortage resulting for either system failure of drought conditions these actions are directed both towards an overall reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply to satisfy these goals the city hereby adopts the following regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water this article is hereby declared necessary for the protection of public health safety and welfare if it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to drought or system failure the city is authorized to issue a proclamation that existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual wateruse demands the proclamation is an attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent that wateruse for human consumption sanitation fire protection and other essential needs becomes endangered immediately upon issuance of such a proclamation regulations and restrictions set forth under this article shall become effective and remain in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the proclamation rescinded water uses that are regulated or prohibited under this article are considered to be nonessential and continuation of such uses during times of water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water subjecting the offenders to penalties i 72103 definition of terms for the purposes of this plan the following definitions will apply aesthetic water use water use for ornamental or decorative purposes such as fountains reflecting pools and waterfalls commercial and industrial use water use

water tier i 0225 gallonseruday regular rate tier ii 226300 gallonseruday 2 times regular rate tier iii over 300 gallonseruday 3 times regular rate b impose a drought surcharge per thousand gallons of water that increases with higher usage the general principle behind the drought surcharge is that the fee is imposed on water use in excess of two hundred twentyfive 225 gallons use the drought surcharge is a temporary fee imposed during the current water supply shortage and is not a costbased rate the drought surcharge is temporary and will be terminated at such time as the city determines the water supply is above the trigger levels c if conservation measures prove inadequate to mitigate the effects of the drought conditions or water supply availability the city may take additional

a the applicable standards of this   and b the standards of articles 618 of this unless this that a particular not apply  waiver see 59 23 conservation subdivision  purpose conventional subdivisions typically produce little open space except floodplains and steep slopes common open space areas in conventional subdivisions are often unusable or are devoted only to specific purposes such as golf courses most open space in conventional subdivisions is contained in private yards with no common access or maintenance further private open space typically involves lawns and landscaping that require heavy maintenance and water demands accordingly the purpose of this section is to provide flexibility in site design in order to allow developers to preserve common open space and natural resources in conservation areas within a subdivision article 2  use patterns north augusta development the specific purposes of this section are a to protect the public health safety and general welfare by avoiding surface and ground water pollution contaminated runoff air quality contamination and urban heat islands which result from pavement and the clearing of natural vegetation  b to protect and preserve natural resources such as wetlands streams lakes steep slopes woodlands and water recharge areas  c to reduce infrastructure and housing costs by reducing the engineering and construction costs produced by conventional subdivision design which requires more pavement wetland crossings grading of trees and natural areas and lawn and landscaping maintenance  d to protect property values by allowing open space design features which enhance the marketability of development  e to provide design flexibility  and f to promote development on soils which are most suitable for urban densities while preserving soils that are primarily adaptable to other uses such as woodlands wildlife habitat and agricultural uses  applicability this section applies to any application meeting the

planning commission at a regularly scheduled meeting it is the intent of this group similar or compatible land uses into specific zoning districts either as permitted uses or as uses authorized by a conditional use permit uses not listed as a permitted or conditional use are presumed to be prohibited from the applicable zoning district in the event that a particular use is not listed in the use matrix and such use is not listed as a prohibited use and is not otherwise prohibited by law the director shall determine whether a materially similar use exists in this section should the director determine that a materially similar use does exist the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed and the directors decision shall be recorded in writing should the director determine that a materially similar use does not exist the matter may be referred to the planning commission for interpretation or for recommendation to the city council for amendment to this establish a specific listing for the use in question article 3  zoning districts north augusta development 2 the director may determine that a use is materially similar if a the use is listed as within the same structure or function classification as the use specifically enumerated in the use matrix table 32 as determined by the lbcs of the apa the use shall be considered materially similar if it falls within the same lbcs classification or meets the requirements of sections b and c below b if the use cannot be located within one of the lbcs classifications pursuant to section a above the director shall refer to the most recent edition of the north american industry classification manual executive office of the president office of management and budget 1997 naics which document is hereby incorporated by this reference the use shall be considered materially similar if it falls within the same industry classification of the naics and meets the requirements of section c below c the proposed use shall not generate average daily trips exceeding other uses proposed in the zoning district by more than ten percent 10% as determined by the most recent edition of the institute of transportation engineers trip generation 6th ed 1997ite manual which document is hereby incorporated by this reference if the trip generation is not listed in the ite manual the use shall be considered materially similar the director may also refer to similar local traffic studies to determine trip generation and average daily trips 3 in order to assist in interpretation of the use matrix table 32 the lbcs and naics numbers precede each use in the use matrix in interpreting the use matrix the following rules of construction shall apply a if a use is listed for a specific classification while a more general classification within the same industry classification is also listed for another use the specific classification governs the specific use is not permitted in all districts where the uses coded to the general classification are permitted simply because they share a similar naics code number the numbers increase as the classifications get more specific a example community homes are coded as naics classification 623210 this is a specific subclass of group 623 entitled nursing and residential care facilities community homes are permitted in the district x however other nursing and residential care facilities listed in naics group 623 are not permitted in district x these uses will fall within the lbcs function classifications 1210 retirement housing services 1220 congregate living services 1230 assistedliving services 1240 lifecare or continuing care services and 1250 skillednursing services b some uses are listed separately but fall within the same lbcs or naics classification the uses within one such classification are not permitted in all of the zoning districts as the others simply because they fall within the same lbcs or naics classification b example restaurant with incidental consumption of alcoholic beverages is coded as lbcs structure 2220 a restaurant no consumption of alcoholic beverages permitted is also coded as structure 2220 the former is listed as a prohibited use in district x it is not considered a permitted use in x simply because it falls within the same lbcs classification as the latter use article 3  zoning districts north

neighborhood preservation corridor overlay district 1 purpose  the neighborhood preservation corridor overlay district applies to areas of the city that are located on collector and arterial streets and are in transition between traditional residential and commercial uses structures in the corridor are predominantly if not exclusively residential in character parcel size is relatively small the underlying zoning in the corridor includes a variety of both commercial and residential districts the continued residential use of some parcels may not be economically feasible it is anticipated that conversion of singlefamily residences to commercial and office establishments will continue demolition of existing residential structures is inconsistent with policies expressed in the comprehensive plan and contemporary commercial development for new retail uses and office buildings is inappropriate new highdensity residential development is also inappropriate alternative uses of existing residential buildings provides a more orderly and reasonable transition for the surrounding neighborhood with appropriate restrictions the conversion of houses to office and small personal service uses is suitable and provides for economically feasible uses of parcels in the corridor this overlay is therefore created with an emphasis on preserving the residential character of the corridors protecting the unique design features and local architecture vernacular and protecting the property values and health safety and general welfare of surrounding neighborhoods the neighborhood preservation corridor overlay district is established to preserve and protect residential neighborhoods while accommodating some transitional commercial uses at an appropriate scale in locations zoned for commercial uses it is the intent of the neighborhood preservation overlay corridor district to maintain the residential appearance of existing structures and the residential setting of any building converted to a nonresidential use so that the converted dwelling will be compatible with neighboring residential property to maintain residential character lots shall not be developed or

this protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally this or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of this intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities including water and gas mains electric lines telephone lines sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions including temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs 92 general provisions  statutory authorization sc title 5 articles 7 23 and 25 articles 5 and 7 and title 6 amendments thereto delegated the responsibility

conjunction with land disturbing and construction activities permitted pursuant to of of this modifications the city engineer may add to or modify the contents of this appendix when appropriate and for valid reasons to clarify or update best management practices associated with erosion and sediment control measures in land disturbing and construction activities such modifications shall be documented and forwarded to the planning commission as information in specific cases and for documented reasons the city engineer may waive the submission of documents or specific activities required herein the reasons for any such waiver shall be recorded in the project application file e2 erosion and sediment control e21 introduction the practice of erosion and sediment control on construction sites has fallen under increasing scrutiny from federal state and local governments as well as the general public the south carolina department of health and environmental control scdhec has had authority over permitting for construction sites conducting land disturbing activities since the mid 1990s on  the city of north augusta stormwater management department smd received delegation of the stormwater program from the scdhec from this point forward the north augusta smd will review land disturbance applications for compliance with division 3 of the north augusta ordinances entitled construction permitting for land disturbing activities this manual should be used as a guidance document for appropriate best management practice bmp selection for erosion and sediment control because this field is rapidly changing the presence or absence of any bmp or specifications for any bmp in this document is subject to revision as additional information becomes available one failing on all too many construction sites is that when one bmp fails it is simply reinstalled as it was before how many of us have seen appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development the same section of silt fence be resurrected again and again and again and again with no more hope for success than it had in the beginning e discussion  unlike engineering standards bmps do not have uniform specifications quantifiable effluent limits nor do they have predictable effectiveness bmps do however require design the designer must have an understanding of the bmp design considerations installation techniques construction specifications and maintenance requirements in order to design erosion control practices that fit the site and are thereby effective in reducing erosion and sedimentation bmps are performancebased construction standards they require constant monitoring and evaluation if they dont work adapt them or move up to the next level of bmp protection many bmps originated over 35 years ago time has proven that some are not effective and have fallen into disuse other bmps which have also proven to be marginally effective are still widely used today their use has been perpetuated for a myriad of reasons contractors are comfortable installing them and the designers have become complacent often designing the erosion control as an after thought to the real project work take silt fence for example silt fence is one of the most widely used bmps for nonpoint source pollution protection however from a practical point it is probably the least effective measure in use across the nation typical silt fence installation renders it ineffective the fences are not trenched and compacted improper application of silt fence frequently results in increased erosion the optimum method of silt fence installation is via the slicing method where a pull behind machine makes a narrow cut into the soil leaving the surrounding soil undisturbed and stronger at a minimum trenching is required e applications of erosion and sediment control practices  frequently the wrong bmp is implemented for the type of control needed a sediment control bmp should not be used for erosion control and an erosion control bmp should not be used when runoff control is needed when the needed control is treated with the wrong type of bmp failure usually occurs for example a silt fence is placed across a slope to prevent erosion maybe the designer wanted to stop sheet and rill erosion in actual practice the silt fence collected and concentrated water which was diverted to a low spot where the fence becomes overloaded and fails an erosion control bmp should have been chosen to treat the erosion problem silt fences are intended for sediment control and should therefore be installed in relatively flat areas suitable for ponding water and depositing sediment a good way to avoid confusion when choosing bmps is to have a clear understanding of what type control is needed and what the corresponding bmps are there are three general categories of controls that have distinct treatments associated with them  1 erosion control 2 runoff control and 3 sediment control e water quality impacts due to erosion and sedimentation  water quality may be impacted during construction activities by sediment runoff from erosion of the site and pollutants from materials stored or used on site during construction post construction water quality impacts are due to the runoff of silt fertilizers pesticides fuels antifreeze metals and other pollutants impervious areas facilitate the transport of pollutants into aquatic environments appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development during construction disturbing the land reduces a sites natural resistance to erosion by removing the vegetative ground cover exposing the soil and changing the topography the severity of erosion depends on the type of soil the amount and intensity of rainfall length and gradient of slopes and surface cover water quality effects due to construction site runoff include a sediment deposition in the storm drainage system clogs pipes and inlets causing inlet bypassing and erosion and results in increased maintenance costs b impacts to aquatic organisms due to an increase in turbidity turbid water interferes with respiration and filter feeding behavior of macroinvertebrates as well as reduces fish feeding success due to visual impairment turbidity decreases photosynthesis for primary producers sediment deposition fills pools and interstitial spaces in the stream bottom necessary for macroinvertebrates and juvenile fishes sedimentation of shallow areas chokes out aquatic vegetation c many pollutants especially metals are bound to and transported with sediments d stream paths may be altered by excessive sedimentation e sedimentation of wetlands reduces their ability to filter runoff and recharge groundwater the primary purpose of this manual is to present effective best management practices bmps which may be used during construction and after to reduce pollutant discharges to the city storm drain system wetlands and streams e erosion and sediment control plans  the erosion control plan or stormwater pollution prevention plan swppp must be prepared before construction begins ideally during the project planning and design phases the erosion control plan shall be submitted along with the rest of the project package during engineering and planning departmental review the stormwater management department will review the swppp as other city departments review other aspects of the project this applies to commercial and subdivision infrastructure projects they need not be submitted for prior approval for all projects sediment and erosion control bmps shall be installed upon clearing once bmps are installed the stormwater management department shall be contacted to conduct an inspection 8034414246 no additional building inspections will be conducted without a satisfactory initial bmp inspection if the site or portion of the site is planned to be idle for more than 21 days then vegetative stabilization must be accomplished within seven days the wet weather plan should include a plan for the immediate within 24 hours of the first forecast of a storm front installation of emergency erosion control measures e22 land grading and site preparation bmps soil is most vulnerable during site preparation as the vegetation is removed and soil is disturbed loosening bonds which help undisturbed soil to resist erosion the types of bmps chosen at this early stage form the foundation of a successful erosion and sediment control plan e scheduling  a definition  sequencing the construction project to reduce the amount and duration of soil exposed to erosion by wind rain runoff and vehicle tracking the construction sequence schedule is an orderly listing of all major landdisturbing appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development activities together with the necessary erosion and sedimentation control measures planned for a project this type of schedule guides the contractor on work to be done before other work is started so that serious erosion and sedimentation problems can be avoided this bmp must be seriously considered for any project exceeding 5 acres b purpose  following a specified work schedule that coordinates the timing of landdisturbing activities and the installation of control measures is perhaps the most costeffective way of controlling erosion during construction the removal of surface ground cover leaves a site vulnerable to accelerated erosion construction procedures that limit land clearing provide the timely installation of erosion and sedimentation controls and restore protective cover quickly can significantly reduce the erosion potential of a site c design considerations  design project to integrate into existing land contours significant regrading of a site will require more costly erosion and sedimentation control measures and may require installation of onsite drainage and sediment control facilities incorporate existing natural areas inventory and evaluate the existing site terrain and vegetation disturbance of highly erosive natural areas eg steep unstable slope areas and watercourses should be minimized while protecting other areas may enhance site aesthetics construction should not disturb these areas d avoid rainy periods 1 allow enough time before rainfall begins to stabilize the soil with vegetation or physical means or to install temporary sediment trapping devices 2 apply perimeter control practices protect the disturbed areas from offsite runoff and prevent sedimentation damage to areas below the development site by applying perimeter control devices 3 minimize soil exposed at one time schedule projects to disturb only small portions of the site at any one time complete grading as soon as possible immediately stabilize the disturbed portion before grading the next portion practice staged seeding in order to revegetate cut and fill slopes as the work progresses e minimize disturbance and buffer strips  a definition  minimizing disturbance and maintaining a buffer strip is a planning process which retains natural vegetative cover and also maintains vegetative buffer strips near watercourses b purpose  erosion can be reduced 98% by protecting the soil from raindrop impact existing native vegetation usually provides the best soil protection one of the most effective erosion control measures is to only disturb areas immediately needed for construction water quality and wildlife habitat degradation can be greatly reduced by maintaining streamside buffer strips and riparian corridors these buffer strips act to filter sediment from the surface runoff before it reaches the watercourse the small drainage and intermittent streams are the sediment delivery systems to the streams and wetlands if sediment can be kept out of the delivery systems by maintaining buffer strips then the sediment will not impact riparian areas or cause other water quality impacts c planning considerations  existing native vegetation should be incorporated into the final landscape plan it is adapted to the site drought tolerant and will provide shade and erosion protection existing trees should be protected as per development requirements if the area is not disturbed then it does not require erosion control and appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development concentrated flows down slope will be greatly reduced buffer strips around the perimeter of a site can reduce or eliminate offsite sedimentation d construction specificationsdesign criteria  1 designate areas of no disturbance clearly show on the plans and flag in the field areas of no disturbance and construction vehicle exclusion 2 designate trees and shrubs that are to be preserved 3 designate watercourse bufferfilter strips on the site design plan 4 maintain and preserve riparian and naturally vegetated buffer strips along watercourses 5 the guide to small roads usdascs also provides information for sizing buffer strips 6 the width of a buffer strip between a road and the stream is recommended to be 50 feet plus four times the slope of the land in percent measured between the road and the top of stream bank 7 buffer width in feet m   50 + 4% slope 8 example for a 10% slope buffer length is 50 feet + 4 10   90 feet e land grading for minimizing erosion  a definition  land grading for minimizing erosion is grading that is intended to minimize the impacts of surface erosion and runoff b purpose  where land grading is necessary for road or building construction these land grading practices are intended to minimize the erosion potential and facilitate plant establishment c design considerations  1 design considerations should include the following 2 development should fit existing topography as much as possible so that land disturbance is minimized 3 slope steepness and excessive slope lengths should be kept to a minimum benches steps or contour furrows can be installed on long slopes to break up the slope length 4 a bench should be graded back towards the slope and drain with a gentle gradient to a stable outlet 5 drainage from upland areas should be diverted away from exposed slopes d construction specifications  1 only disturb clear or grade areas necessary for construction flag or otherwise delineate areas not to be disturbed exclude vehicles and construction equipment from these areas to preserve natural vegetation 2 all graded or disturbed areas including slopes shall be protected during clearing and construction in accordance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan until they are permanently stabilized 3 all sediment control measures shall be constructed and maintained in accordance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan and according to the standards and specifications for the appropriate erosion control practices 4 if topsoil is required for the establishment of vegetation it shall be stockpiled in the amount necessary to complete finished grading and protected from erosion during the interim 5 areas to be filled should be cleared grubbed to remove trees vegetation roots and other objectionable material and stripped of topsoil the outer face of the fill slope should be allowed to stay loose not rolled compacted or bladed smooth a bulldozer may run up and down the fill slope so the dozer treads cleat tracks create grooves perpendicular to the slope if the soil is not too moist excessive appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development compaction will not occur use slope breaks such as diversions benches or contour furrows as appropriate to reduce the length of cutandfill slopes to limit sheet and rill erosion and prevent gully erosion slopes in excess of  may require hydroseeding hydromulching tackifying andor punchingin straw bioengineering techniques or retaining walls roughen the surface of all slopes during the construction operation to retain water increase infiltration and facilitate vegetation establishment 6 stabilize all graded areas with vegetation crushed stone riprap or other ground cover as soon as grading is completed or if work is interrupted for 21 working days or more use mulch to stabilize areas temporarily where final grading must be delayed stockpiles borrow areas and spoil areas shall be shown on the plans and shall be stabilized to prevent erosion and sedimentation figure e1 stepped or terraced slope e surface roughening  a definition  surface roughening is a technique for roughening a bare soil surface with furrows running across the slope stair stepping or tracking with construction equipment appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development b purpose  surface roughening is intended to aid the establishment of vegetative cover from seed to reduce runoff velocity and increase infiltration and to reduce erosion and provide for sediment trapping c conditions where practice applies  all construction slopes require surface roughening to facilitate longterm stabilization with vegetation particularly slopes steeper than  d planning considerations  rough slope surfaces are preferred because they aid the establishment of vegetation improve water infiltration and decrease runoff velocity graded areas with smooth hard surfaces may be initially attractive but such surfaces increase the potential for erosion a rough loose soil surface gives a mulching effect that provides more favorable moisture conditions than hard smooth surfaces  this aids seed germination there are different methods for achieving a roughened soil surface on a slope and the selection of an appropriate method depends upon the type of slope roughening methods include stairstep grading furrowing and tracking factors to be considered in choosing a method are slope steepness mowing requirements and whether the slope is formed by cutting or filling e construction specifications  1 cut slope roughening a stairstep grade or groove the cut slopes that are steeper than  b use stairstep grading on any erodible material soft enough to be ripped with a bulldozer slopes consisting of soft rock with some subsoil are particularly suited to stairstep grading c groove the slope using machinery to create a series of ridges and depressions that run across the slope on the contour 2 fill slope roughening a place fill slopes with a gradient steeper than  in lifts not to exceed 8 inches 02 m and make sure each lift is properly compacted b ensure that the face of the slope consists of loose uncompacted fill 46 inches 0102 m deep c use grooving or tracking to roughen the face of the slopes if necessary d apply seed fertilizer and straw mulch then track or punch in the mulch with the bulldozer do not blade or scrape the final slope face f inspection and maintenance  1 periodically check the seeded slopes for rills and washes fill these areas slightly above the original grade then reseed and mulch as soon as possible figure e2 surface roughening appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development figure e3 surface roughening detail e temporary gravel construction entranceexit  a definition  a temporary gravel construction entranceexit is a stabilized pad of crushed stone located at any point where traffic enters or leaves a construction site onto a public rightofway street alley sidewalk or parking area b purpose  a stabilized construction entrance is intended to reduce offsite sedimentation by eliminating the tracking or flowing of sediment onto public rightsofway c design considerations  construction plans should limit traffic to properly constructed and stabilized entrances especially during wet weather operations d construction specifications  1 the aggregate size for construction of the pad shall be 23 inch stone place the gravel to the specific grade and dimensions shown on the plans and smooth it 2 the thickness of the pad shall not be less than 6 inches use geotextile fabrics if necessary to improve stability of the foundation in locations subject to seepage or high water table the width of the pad shall not be less than the full width of all points of ingress or egress and in any case shall not be less than 12 feet wide the length of the pad shall be as required but not less than 50 feet for larger projects and 30 feet for individual residential lots appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development  locate construction entrances and exits to limit sediment leaving the site and to provide for maximum utility by all construction vehicles avoid entrances which have steep grades and entrances at curves in public roads 4 the entrance shall be maintained in a condition that will prevent tracking or flowing of sediment onto public rightsofway this may require periodic top dressing with additional stone as conditions demand and repair andor maintenance of any measures used to trap sediment 5 all sediment spilled dropped washed or tracked onto public rightsofway shall be removed immediately 6 provide drainage to carry water to a sediment trap or other suitable outlet 7 when necessary wheels shall be cleaned to remove sediment prior to entrance onto public rightsofway when washing is required it shall be done on an area stabilized with crushed stone that drains into an approved sediment trap or sediment basin 8 all sediment shall be prevented from entering any storm drain ditch or watercourse of sand bags gravel straw bales or other approved methods e inspection and maintenance  1 maintain the gravel pad in a condition to prevent mud or sediment from leaving the construction site 2 replace gravel material when surface voids are visible 3 after each rainfall inspect any structure used to trap sediment and clean it out as necessary 4 immediately remove all objectionable materials spilled washed or tracked onto public roadways remove all sediment deposited on paved roadways within 24 hours appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development figure e4 temporary gravel construction entranceexit appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development e23 vegetative establishment bmps e vegetation as a solution  a dense healthy vegetation and the associated leaf litter protects the soil from raindrop impact raindrop impact is a major force in dislodging soil particles which then allows them to move downslope or form a crust on the soil surface when a crust forms on the soil surface the rainfall infiltration rate decreases and runoff increases b vegetation also protects the soil from sheet and rill erosion it shields the soil surface from the transport of soil particles and scour from overland flow sheet flow and it decreases the erosive energy of the flowing water by reducing its velocity c the shielding effect of the plant canopy and leaves is augmented by roots and rhizomes that hold the soil in place improve the soils physical condition and increase the rate of infiltration further decreasing runoff plants also remove water from the soil thus increasing its capacity to absorb water d suitable vegetative cover provides excellent erosion protection and reduces the need for high cost and high maintenance sediment control measures e exposed subsoils are generally difficult to amend are infertile and require more irrigation e seeding for erosion control general seeding guidelines  a timing guide lines  before planting all construction should be completed so as to not disturb the planting area temporary erosion control seeding should be applied on sites intended to lie dormant for over 21 days permanent erosion control seeding should be applied on sites intended to be dormant for over 1 year mulch can also provide for the shortterm erosion control need both mulch and annual grasses provide a microclimate that is more suitable for the establishment of perennial plants b soil amendments  before any soil amendments are applied on a site an appropriate soil test should be completed to determine appropriate lime and fertilization rates it is important to provide minimum amounts of nitrogen n phosphorous p and potassium k to plants this is especially true on disturbed sites that are generally deficient c quality of seed mixes  seeds containing prohibited or restricted noxious weeds should not be accepted seed should not contain in excess of 05% weed seed seed should have a minimum acceptable pure live seed pls of 80% this is calculated by multiplying the minimum seed purity % and the minimum germination % rates from the seed tag divide by 100 to get the percent pls for example seed a is tagged 9948% purity and 81% germination therefore 9948 x 81  100   8057% pls which is within acceptable limits seeds with less than 80% pls will require the quantity to seed be increased to meet specifications d planting considerations  1 seed should be planted at acceptable rates per scdot or by using table e1 2 seed should be drilled harrowed hydroseeded with a tackifier or covered with mulch that is anchored by discing 3 if rainfall is not adequate the area must be irrigated 4 for final stabilization both temporary and permanent seed must be used appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development table e1 appropriate seeding rates for north augusta a b c d e

materials to bare soil and establishing erosionresistant vegetation on disturbed areas and critical slopes b purpose  by using hydraulic equipment hydroseeders and hydromulchers seed soil amendments wood fiber mulch and tackifying agents bonded fiber matrix and liquid copolymers can be uniformly broadcast as a hydraulic slurry onto the soil these erosion and dust control materials can often be applied in one operation hydraulic planting is effectively used to establish vegetation intended to control erosion on steep critical slopes that cannot practically be treated with other methods hydraulic planting techniques such as hydroseeding and hydrosprigging are also used to establish stands of turf grass c conditions where practice applies  hydraulic planting is a very effective method for applying seed and mulch material this practice will uniformly distribute seed which can then be covered with protective mulch ensuring favorable conditions for quick germination and growth hydraulic planting is relatively more expensive than manual seeding and mulching however hydraulic planting generally requires less seedbed preparation  the soil surface may be left irregular with large clods stones or rock outcroppings exposed appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development d hydraulic planting techniques should be considered for temporary and permanent erosion control seeding and mulching for sites with the following conditions 1 slopes steeper than  that cannot receive adequate seedbed preparation and the mulch would be difficult to otherwise anchor 2 where the slope surface is irregular with large clods stones or a high percentage of rock 3 where site conditions such as irregular soil surfaces existing vegetation and shallow soils preclude the installation of erosion control blankets and mats 4 on sites where other soil stabilization seeding and mulching practices would require unacceptable levels of disturbance 5 on sites where it is desirable to apply water seeds and mulch in one operation 6 on critical erosion sites where the application of seed fiber fertilizer followed by the application of straw mulch and tackifier the threestep process is desirable 7 on sites where straw mulch has been applied and the straw needs to be anchored tacked with tackifiers or hydraulic mulches 8 on sites where dust control is desired e design considerations  hydraulic machines are used to spray seed tack down straw bind the soil seal the soil or apply blanketlike coats of bonded fiber matrix bfm these materials are usually applied by spraying a slurry often in one application f types of hydraulically applied materials for erosion and dust control 1 seed and fertilizer applying seed and fertilizer with water has many benefits the seed blend can be distributed uniformly the added mass increases accuracy and throw distance especially for exposed windy areas and the presoaking and water accelerates germination and enhances the chance of survival 2 mulches hydraulically applied mulches include mulches made from wood fibers paper fibers combination recycled wood and paper fibers and polyester andor polypropylene fibers 3 tackifiers tackifiers are typically used to anchor or glue mulch to increase effectiveness of erosion control tackifiers used in conjunction with straw mulch are extremely effective in bonding the straw to itself and the soil surface thus resisting movement by water or wind liquid formulations of acrylic copolymers can also be specified alone to control erosion and dust these products chemically bond and stabilize the soil surface 4 cementious binders these products are formulated from hydrated lime or gypsum mixed with water and applied to the soil with hydraulic equipment fiber mulch seed and fertilizers can be applied with the slurry and sprayed on in one application these cementious binders form a permeable crust on the soil surface which control water and wind erosion 5 bonded fiber matrix bfm hydraulic matrix products are typically produced from longer fibers combined with tackifiers and binding agents that are hydraulically applied and conform to the ground and dry to form a bonded fiber matrix seed and fertilizer can be added to the slurry and applied with the bfm in onestep application g site preparation  grade as needed and feasible to permit the use of equipment for seedbed preparation install needed erosion control practices such as sediment basins diversion dikes and channels prior to seeding divert concentrated flows away from hydraulic planted areas conduct soil tests to determine ph add amendments as necessary to adjust ph the seedbed should be firm but not compact the top 3 inches of soil should be loose moist and free of large clods and stones appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development h planting  1 seed to soil contact is important for successful germination 2 use dormant seeding techniques for late fall or winter seeding schedules 3 use seed rates based on pure live seed pls of 80% when pls is below 80% adjust rates accordingly i hydraulic mulching  the mulch should be mixed with seed fertilizer and additives as specified and applied at a rate recommended by the manufacturer in order to achieve uniform effective coverage and provide adequate distribution of seed apply straw mulch binders tackifiers heavier at the edges in valleys and at the crest of banks j inspection and maintenance  1 hydraulically treated areas shall be inspected and monitored after installation and periodically thereafter 2 if the hydraulic mulch or tackifiers were applied as stand alone without vegetation treatments for erosion and dust control the products longevity must match the length of time that the soil will remain bare or until revegetation occurs periodic inspections will assure the intended purposes will be met 3 areas which fail to establish cover adequate to prevent erosion shall be reseeded and remulched as soon as such areas are identified e mulching  a definition  mulching is the application of a protective layer of straw or other suitable material to the soil surface straw mulch andor hydromulch are also used in conjunction with seeding and hydroseeding of critical areas for the establishment of temporary or permanent vegetation mulching with straw or fiber mulches is commonly used as a temporary measure to protect bare or disturbed soil areas that have not been seeded b purposes  to temporarily stabilize bare and disturbed soils to protect the soil surface from raindrop impact to increase infiltration to conserve moisture to prevent soil compaction or crusting and to decrease runoff mulching also fosters growth of vegetation by protecting the seeds from predators reducing evaporation and insulating the soil c design considerations  mulch can be applied to any site where soil has been disturbed and the protective vegetation has been removed the most common use of mulch is to provide temporary stabilization of soil usually until permanent stabilizing vegetation is established where mulches are used to compliment vegetation establishment they should be designed to last as long as it takes to establish effective vegetative erosion control where mulches are used as surface cover only ie bark wood chips or straw mulch cover the serviceable duration of the application and maintenance requirements including augmentation or replication should be specified on steep slopes greater than 2 or where the mulch is susceptible to movement by wind or water the mulch material should be hydraulically applied or the straw mulch should be appropriately anchored hydraulic fiber mulches andor tackifying agents are used effectively to bind the straw together and prevent displacement by wind or rain d construction specifications  1 straw straw is an excellent mulch material because of its length and bulk it is highly effective in reducing the impact of raindrops and in moderating the microclimate of the soil surface straw mulch can be applied by hand on small sites and blown on by machine on large sites mulch should not be applied more appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development than 2 inches deep on seeded sites unless it is incorporated into the soil by tracking disking or other punching in techniques 2 anchoring a straw mulch must be anchored immediately to minimize loss by wind or water straw mulch is commonly anchored by b crimping tracking disking or punching into the soil  c covering with a netting  d spraying with asphaltic or organic tackifier  e tacking with cellulose fiber mulch at a rate of 750 lbsac 3 hydraulic mulches from wood and paper fiber these combination mulches are generally comprised of 70% wood fiber and 30% paper fiber manufactured from lumber mill waste virgin wood chips recycled newsprint office paper and other waste paper the mulch is mixed in a hydraulic applicating machine hydroseeder and applied as slurry in combination with the recommended seed and fertilizer the mulch can be specified with or without a tackifier a inspection and maintenance  if properly applied and anchored little additional maintenance is required during the first few months after high winds or significant rainstorms mulched areas should be checked for adequate cover and remulched if necessary mulch needs to last until vegetation develops to provide permanent erosion resistant cover straw mulch can last from 6 months to 2 years erosion control blankets are effective for up to 2 years appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development figure e5 typical drawing straw anchoring e24 stormwater conveyance bmps e grasslined channels  a definition  vegetation lining a natural or constructed waterway swale or dike to protect it from erosion b purpose  grass protection of drainageways reduces erosion by lowering water velocity over the soil surface and by binding soil particles with roots the drainageway is any ground surface over which concentrated runoff travels it is typically a manmade waterway swale or ditch it may also be the upslope flow of water and directs the concentrated flow along the surface of the barrier c grasslined channels should be used where 1 a vegetative lining can provide sufficient stability for the channel grade by increasing maximum permissible velocity  2 slopes are generally less than 5%  appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development  site conditions required to establish vegetation ie climate soils and topography are present d grass lined channels may be reinforced using either 1 cellular confinement systems geocells which significantly improve the hydraulic performance of vegetation by confining the soil layer within the cellular structure confinement and anchorage of the root structure increases the limiting shear resistance of the protection and the permissible flow duration geocell systems are recommended for swales ditches and on upper slopes of large channels where flows are intermittent of low to moderate intensity and of relatively short duration <24 hours 2 erosion control blankets which can be selected for low to medium velocity intermittent flows permanent to temporary biodegradable options are available proper installation of ecbs is crucial to longterm success channels with design velocities greater than 2 feet sec will require that turf reinforcement mats erosion control blankets or netting be installed at the time of seeding to provide stability until the vegetation is fully established it may also be necessary to divert water from the channel until vegetation is established or to line the channel with sod whenever design velocities exceed 4 feet sec a permanent type of erosion control blanket or turf reinforcement mat will be necessary e design considerations  grasslined channels resemble natural systems and are usually preferred where design velocities are suitable select appropriate vegetation and construct channels early in the construction schedule before grading and paving increase runoff rates generally grasslined channels are constructed in stable low areas to conform to the natural drainage system but they may also be needed along roadways or property boundary to reduce erosion potential design the channel to avoid sharp bends and steep grades the channel cross section should be wide and shallow with relatively flat side slopes so surface water can enter over the vegetated banks without erosion riprap may be needed to protect the channel banks at intersections where flow velocities approach allowable limits and turbulence may occur crosssection designs include 1 vshaped  generally used where the quantity of water is relatively small such as roadside ditches the vshaped cross section is desirable because of difficulty stabilizing the bottom where velocities may be high a grass or sod lining will suffice where velocities are low or rock or riprap lining may be necessary 2 parabolic  often used where larger flows are expected and sufficient space is available the shape is pleasing and may best fit site conditions riprap should be used where higher velocities are expected and where some dissipation of energy velocity is desired combinations of grass with riprap centers or turf reinforcement mat centers are useful where there is a continuous low flow in the channel 3 trapezoidal  used where runoff volumes are large and slope is low so that velocities are nonerosive to vegetated linings trapezoidal channels generally have concrete or riprap lined center for low flow 4 grasslined channels must not be subject to

establishment grasslined channels should be repaired and grass reestablished if necessary 2 after grass has become established the channel should be checked periodically to determine if the channel is withstanding flow velocities without damage 3 check the channel for debris scour or erosion and immediately make repairs it is particularly important to check the channel outlet and all road crossings for bank stability and evidence of piping or scour holes and make repairs immediately 4 remove all significant sediment accumulations to maintain the designed carrying capacity 5 keep the grass in a healthy vigorous condition at all times since it is the primary erosion protection for the channel permanent grassed waterways should be seasonally maintained by mowing depending on the type of

feet sec 61 msec such that channel lining is required but conditions are not suitable for vegetative protection specific conditions include 2 all roadside ditches or drainage channels greater than 2% and located in highly erodible soils that have a low maximum permissible velocity 3 the channel design velocity exceeds that allowable for a grasslined channel 4 the channel will continue to downcut

constructed immediately above a new cut or soil fill slope or around the perimeter of a disturbed area b purposes  1 to divert storm runoff from upslope drainage areas away from unprotected disturbed areas and slopes to a stabilized outlet 2 to divert sedimentladen runoff from a disturbed area to a sedimenttrapping facility such as a sediment trap or sediment basin 3 an upslope dike can improve working conditions at the construction site and prevent erosion 4 a downslope dike assures that sedimentladen runoff will not leave the site without treatment c planning considerations  it is very important that a temporary diversion dike be stabilized immediately following installation with temporary or permanent vegetation to prevent erosion of the dike itself the gradient must have a positive grade to assure drainage but if the gradient is too great precautions must be taken to prevent erosion due to high velocity channel flow behind the dike temporary diversion dikes are often used as a perimeter control in association with a sediment trap or a sediment basin or a series of sedimenttrapping facilities on moderate to large construction sites if installed properly and in the

bottom of a cut or fill slope b purpose  to convey concentrated runoff down the face of a cut or fill slope without causing erosion c conditions where practice applies  this practice applies to construction areas where stormwater runoff above a cut or fill slope will cause erosion if allowed to flow over the slope temporary slope drains are generally used in conjunction with diversions to convey runoff down a slope until permanent water disposal measures can be installed d planning considerations  constructed slopes are often exposed to erosion between the time they are graded and permanently stabilized during this period the slope is very vulnerable to erosion and temporary slope drains together with temporary diversions can provide valuable protection it is very important that these temporary structures be sized installed and maintained properly because their failure will usually result in severe erosion of the slope the entrance section to the appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development drain should be wellentrenched and stable so that surface water can enter freely the drain should extend downslope beyond the toe of the slope to a stable area or appropriately stabilized outlet other points of concern are failure from overtopping from inadequate pipe inlet capacity and lack of maintenance of diversion channel capacity and ridge height

minimum of 15 feet 05 m and at least 6 inches 150 mm higher than the adjoining ridge on either side the lowest point of the diversion ridge should be a minimum of 1 foot 300 mm above the top of the drain so that design flow can freely enter the pipe 6 outlet protection protect the outlet of the slope drain from erosion with an energy dissipater f construction specifications  1 a common failure of slope drains is caused by water saturating the soil and seeping along the pipe proper backfilling around and under the pipe haunches with stable soil material and hand compacting in 6 inch 150 mm

diagonally across a sloping road or utility rightofway that is subject to erosion b purpose  to limit the accumulation of erosive volumes of water on roads by diverting surface runoff at predesigned intervals c planning considerations  construction of access roads power lines pipelines and other similar installations often requires clearing long narrow rightofways over sloping terrain roads concentrate runoff gully formation may be especially severe in tire tracks and ruts to prevent gully erosion runoff can often be diverted across the width of the rightofway to undisturbed areas by using waterbars or rolling dips a waterbar is a berm and excavation built diagonally across the road waterbars generally become less effective if driven over during wet weather and are difficult to cross with low clearance vehicles rolling dips are gently sloping excavations running diagonally across the road surface and are more appropriate for winter use rolling dips are more difficult to construct but are much easier to traverse and require less maintenance give special consideration to each individual outlet area as well as to the cumulative effect of added diversions never outlet

development e energy dissipator  a definition  an energy dissipator is a structure designed to control erosion at the outlet of a channel or conduit b purpose  to prevent erosion at the outlet of a channel or conduit by reducing the velocity of flow and dissipating the energy c conditions where practice applies  this practice applies where the discharge velocity of a pipe box culvert diversion open channel or other water conveyance structure exceeds the permissible velocity of the receiving channel or disposal area d planning considerations  the outlets of channels conduits and other structures are points of high erosion potential because they frequently carry flows at velocities that exceed the allowable limit for the area downstream to prevent scour and undermining an outlet stabilization structure is needed to absorb the impact of the flow and reduce the velocity to nonerosive levels the riprap apron should be extended downstream until stable conditions are reached even though this may exceed the length calculated for design velocity control riprapstilling basins or plunge pools reduce flow velocity rapidly they should be considered in lieu of aprons where overfalls exit at the ends of pipes or where high flows would require excessive apron length consider other energy dissipators such as concrete impact basins or paved outlet structures where site conditions warrant e design criteria  the criteria for design of riprap outlets are 1 capacity 10year peak runoff or the design discharge of the water conveyance structure whichever is greater 2 apron size if the water conveyance structure discharges directly into a defined channel extend the apron across the channel bottom and up the channel banks to an elevation of 05 feet 150 mm above the maximum tailwater depth or to the top of the bank whichever is less determine the maximum allowable velocity for the receiving stream and design the riprap apron to reduce the flow to this velocity before the flow leaves the apron calculate the apron length for velocity control or use the length required to meet stable conditions downstream whichever is greater 3 grade ensure that the apron has zero grade there should be no overfall at the end of the apron  that is the elevation of the top of the apron at the downstream end should be the same as the elevation of the bottom of the receiving channel or the adjacent ground if there is no channel 4 alignment the apron should be straight throughout its entire length but if a curve is necessary to align the apron with the receiving stream locate the curve in the upstream section of riprap 5 materials ensure that riprap consists of a wellgraded mixture of stone larger stone should predominate with sufficient smaller sizes to fill the voids between the stones the diameter of the largest stone size should be no greater than 15 times the d50 size 6 thickness the minimum thickness of riprap shall be 15 times the maximum stone diameter 7 filter

that the apron is properly aligned with the receiving stream 5 immediately after construction stabilize all disturbed areas with vegetation g inspection and maintenance  inspect riprap outlet structures after heavy rains to see if any erosion around or below the riprap has taken place or if stones have been dislodged immediately make all needed repairs to prevent further damage figure e13 energy dissipator appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development e25 erosion control bmps erosion control is any practice that protects the soil surfaces and prevents the soil particles from being detached by rainfall or wind erosion control therefore is a source control that treats the soil as a resource that has value and should be kept in place the most efficient and economical method of controlling sheet rill and raindrop impact erosion is to establish vegetative cover from seed vegetation can reduce erosion by more than 90% by protecting the soil from raindrop impact and sheet erosion when erosion control bmps are implemented and maintained the amount of sediment associated with runoff waters can be dramatically reduced whenever possible do erosion control first and sediment control second some important points to remember a vegetative cover is the primary erosion control practice b retain existing vegetation by minimizing disturbance and scheduling large land disturbances during periods of expected dry weather c establishing cover immediately after disturbance staging is important d temporary erosion control is usually achieved by seeding with fast growing annual grasses andor protecting the soil with mulch e permanent erosion control usually involves planting perennial grasses shrubs and trees the selection of the right plant material for the site choosing the correct mulching technique and proper seedbed preparation are critical for effective erosion control surface roughening contour furrows and stepped slopes are essential to establish vegetation e costs  nonstructural erosion control practices are generally more costeffective than sediment control for example the cost of temporary seeding one acre would be comparable to the cost of installing 200 lf of silt fence for a 1 acre drainage or equivalent to the cost of constructing a temporary sediment trap designed for a oneacre drainage however the practice of temporary seeding would probably be more effective while the silt fence and sediment trap will require regular and costly maintenance erosion control is generally more costeffective than sediment control and requires less maintenance and repair e erosion control blankets and mats  a definition  the installation of protective mulch blankets or soil stabilization mats turf reinforcement mats to the prepared soil surface of a steep slope channel or shoreline b purpose  erosion control blankets are used to temporarily stabilize and protect disturbed soil from raindrop impact and surface erosion to increase infiltration decrease compaction and soil crusting and to conserve soil moisture mulching with erosion control blankets will increase the germination rates for grasses and legumes and promote vegetation establishment erosion control blankets also protect seeds from birds reduce desiccation and evaporation by insulating the soil and seed environment c some types of erosion control blankets and turf reinforcement mats are specifically designed to stabilize channelized flow areas these blankets and mats can aide the establishment of vegetation in waterways and increase the maximum permissible velocity of the given channel by reinforcing the soil and vegetation to resist the forces appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development of erosion during runoff events stems roots and rhizomes of the vegetation become intertwined with the mat reinforcing the vegetation and anchoring the mat d conditions where practice applies  establishing vegetation in channels or on slopes may require additional measures beyond seeding and straw mulching conditions where erosion control blankets and mats are appropriate may include 1 slopes and disturbed soils where mulch must be anchored and other methods such as crimping or tackifying are neither feasible nor adequate 2 steep slopes generally steeper than  3 slopes where erosion hazard is high 4 critical slopes adjacent to sensitive areas such as streams and wetlands 5 disturbed soil areas where planting is likely to be slow in providing adequate protective cover 6 channels with flow exceeding 24 feet sec 061 msec 7

figure e17 cellular confinement systems e26 sediment control bmps sedimentation is the deposition of soil particles that have been transported by water or wind the amount of sediment produced during construction is directly proportional to the degree and effectiveness of erosion control practices implemented the quantity and size of the particles transported increases with the velocity of the runoff appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development sediment control is used to keep sediment the product of erosion onsite sediment control involves the construction of structures that allow sediment to settle out of suspension sediment control structures therefore require frequent inspection and maintenance generally sediment is retained onsite by two methods a slowing runoff velocities as they flow area sufficiently so that sediment cannot be transported  and b impounding sedimentladen runoff for a period of time so that the soil particles settle out sediment controls are not filters practices referred to as sediment filtering actually work by slowing velocities and allowing sediment impoundment to dewater in a very slow and controlled manner for effective sediment control planning and design materials such as geotextiles silt fences and straw bales should be considered for their ability to impound water and slow runoff velocities not for their ability to filter sediment effective sediment control involves ponding sedimentladen runoff long enough for the soil particles to settle out of suspension reducing runoff velocities will also reduce sediment transport and thereby help retain sediment onsite structural sediment control can be divided into three general types a sediment basins  b sediment traps  and c sediment barriers e temporary sediment traps excavated sediment traps & excavated storm drain inlets  a definition  temporary traps designed to trap sediment from small contributing areas during construction these traps typically require less design work and are inexpensive to construct b design criteria  temporary sediment traps are recommended for disturbed drainage areas less than 5 ac 2 ha a typical sediment trap designed to handle 05 inches 127 mm of runoff over a 24 hour period would require a settling zone capacity of 67 yd3  ac 130 m3  ha of contributing drainage area and a sediment storage capacity of 33 yd3  ac 65 m3  ha of drainage area excavated sediment traps require less rigorous design work are smaller in size and they are easier to construct  therefore a preferable alternative is to subdivide large projects into smaller subareas less than 5 ac and utilize numerous sediment traps multiple traps and  or additional volume may be required to accommodate site specific rainfall and soil conditions this approach may facilitate phased construction along relatively narrow highway row excavated storm drain inlets are small excavated sediment traps located at storm drain inlets are effective as part of phased construction the design capacity of excavated inlet sediment traps shall be 67 yd3  acre 1800 ft3  ac of contributing drainage area these excavations are temporary and they are not very effective for trapping small particles silt and clay and they should not be used where runoff velocities are high appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development c construction specifications  1 sediment traps should have a controlled overflow such as a riprap outlet 2 typically a sediment barrier such as silt fencing should be located below the outlet 3 a temporary diversion berm should direct flow into the trap d inspection and maintenance  1 inspect after each rain 2 likely sediment will need to be removed after each rain 3 ensure that the outlet is stable figure e18 sediment traps e temporary sediment basin  a definition  a temporary sediment basin is a pond created by excavation in construction of an embankment and designed to retain or detain runoff sufficiently to allow excess sediment to settle b purpose  the temporary sediment basin is intended to collect and store sediment from sites that are cleared andor graded during construction or for extended periods of time before permanent vegetation is reestablished or before permanent drainage structures are completed it is intended to trap sediment before it leaves the appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development construction site the basin is temporary with a design life of 12 to 18 months and is to be maintained until the site area is permanently stabilized c design considerations  1 sediment basins can trap 7080 percent of the sediment which flows into them if designed and constructed appropriately this design requires a runoff detention time of 2440 hours the sediment basin designed according to the criteria in this manual is only practically effective in removing sediment down to the medium silt size sedimentladen runoff with smaller size fractions fine silts and clay will likely pass untreated basin sediment ponds may be capable of trapping smaller soil particles if additional detention time is provided chemical flocculants such as polyacrylamide may also be effective there are inherent problems associated with constructing basins large enough to pond all the sedimentladen runoff long enough to allow all of the fine soil particles to settle out therefore sediment basins must be used in conjunction with other erosion control practices in order to increase effectiveness and trap efficiently 2 sediment basins should be located where failure of the embankment would not cause loss of life or property damage a good location is where a post construction detention basin is proposed d design criteria  1 design the basin to capture runoff from a 2year 24hour storm 2 a detention time of 2440 hours is required to allow 7080 percent of the sediment to settle 3 use a subsurface drain andor a solid riser pipe with sufficient dewatering holes to provide sufficient detention time a perforated riser with a filter fabric andor gravel jacket may provide sufficient detention time for basins draining up to 10 acres 405 ha determine the sediment basin volume the sediment basin volume consists of two zones a a sediment storage zone at least 1 foot 03 m in depth b a settling zone at least 2 feet 06 m in depth 1 the settling zone volume is determined by the following equation a v   12sdqvsed b q   design inflow based on the peak discharge from a specified design storm eg a 2year 24hour duration design storm event

is not specified c vsed   the settling velocity of the design soil particle the design soil particle chosen is medium silt 002 mm this has a settling velocity vsed of  feet sec 024 mmsec as a general rule it will not be necessary to design for a particle of size less than 002 mm especially since the surface area requirement increases dramatically for smaller particle sizes for example a design particle of 001 mm requires about three times the surface area of 002 mm note also that choosing vsed of  feet sec 024 mmsec equates to a surface area sa of 1250 ft2 1161 m2 per cfs of inflow d sd   settling depth which should be at least 2 feet 06 m and no shallower than the average distance from the inlet to the outlet of the pond l divided by 200 iesd>l200 4 the total sediment basin volume and dimensions are determined as outlined below appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development a determine the basin geometry for the sediment storage volume calculated above using a minimum of 1 foot 03 m depth and  side slopes from the bottom of the basin note the basin bottom is level b extend the basin side slopes at  max as necessary to obtain the settling zone volume as determined above c adjust the geometry of the basin to effectively combine the settling zone volume and sediment storage volumes while preserving the depth and side slope criteria d provide an emergency spillway with a crest elevation one foot above the tip of the riser pipe e the ratio between the basin length and width of the pond should either be greater than  or baffles should be installed to prevent shortcircuiting f the length to settling depth ratio lsd should be less than 200 e construction specifications  1 construct the basin by excavating or building an embankment before any clearing or grading work begins 2 a cutoff trench shall be excavated along the centerline of the earth fill embankments the minimum depth shall be 2 feet 06 m the cutoff trench shall extend up both abutments to the riser crest elevation 3 fill material for the embankment should be clean mineral soil free of roots woody vegetation oversized stones rocks or other objectionable material 4 fill material shall be placed in 6 inch 02 m lifts continuous layers over the entire length of the fill compacting shall be obtained by routing the hauling equipment over the fill so that the entire surface of each layer of the fill is traversed by at least one wheel or tread track of the equipment or by the use of a compactor 5 the embankment should be constructed to an elevation of 10 percent higher than the design height to allow for settlement if compacting is achieved with hauling equipment if compactors are used for compacting the overbuild may be reduced to not less than 5 percent 6 the emergency spillway shall not be installed in fill elevations design width and entrance and exit channel slopes are critical to the successful operation of the emergency spillway f inspection and maintenance  1 inspect weekly and after each rain 2 all damages caused by soil erosion or construction equipment shall be repaired before the end of each working day 3 remove sediment when the sediment storage zone is half full this sediment shall be placed in such a manner that it will not erode from the site the sediment shall not be deposited downstream from the embankment or in or adjacent to a stream or floodplain 4 when temporary structures have served their intended purpose and the contributing drainage area has been properly stabilized the embankment and resulting sediment deposit shall be leveled or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the approved erosion and sediment control plan g skimmer outlet  the skimmer maximizes the use of the volume and surface area of the basin by regulating the flow of water out of the basin such that it maintains a pool of water that promotes sedimentation the skimmer does not increase sedimenttrapping efficiency in a way that allows the size of the basin to be reduced the only way for a basin to be effective is for the basin to fill quickly because the sediment can fall out of suspension only when the pond is full of water conventional appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development basins with perforated risers or stone outlets frequently do not fill because the outlet structures do not adequately regulate the outflow the skimmer drains the basin slowly over several days and at a constant rate to maximize sedimentation instead of draining the basin from the bottom and releasing the runoff containing the most sediment the skimmer releases the least polluted water from near the surface figure e19 typical sediment basin appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development figure e20 sediment basin with baffles and skimmer outlet appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development figure e21 skimmer sediment pond outlet appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development e brush barrier  a definition  a brush barrier is generally constructed of the vegetative material cleared from the site and often pushed to the permitted clearing limits into a windrow the brush barrier may be faced with wire with silt fence attached b purpose  a brush barrier is a sediment control practice that is extremely effective due to the inherent strength of the windrowed material often containing heavy logs and stumps as with other sediment controls proper placing is important to success c design considerations  1 brush barriers are often 37 feet in height 2 they should be installed on the contour 3 as an improvement wire may be attached to the face if the barrier with filter fabric keyed into the soil and fastened to the wire with large heavy barriers an additional section of filter fabric may be installed above the first this creates the effect of a sediment trap while silt fence should be cleaned after the accumulation of 9 of sediment a well constructed brush barrier could hold 12 feet of sediment accumulation this accumulation should be removed before at project completion 4 upon removal of the wire fabric and accumulated sediment the barrier may be left in place to decompose d inspection and maintenance  1 periodic inspections to identify excess sedimentation and torn fabric are important new fabric may easily be installed over the damaged portions e silt fence  a definition  a silt fence is a temporary sediment barrier consisting of filter fabric entrenched into the soil and attached to supporting posts silt fence installed with a trencher or by slicing is the most effective installation method to ensure against common silt fence failures b purpose  silt fence is a sediment control practice silt fence is intended to be installed where sedimentladen water can pond thus allowing the sediment to fall out of suspension and separate from the runoff it is not intended to be an erosion control practice improperly applied or installed silt fence will increase erosion reasons for the high failure rate of improperly designed and installed silt fence include 1 improper placement on the site  2 allowing excessive drainage area to the silt fence structure  3 shallow trenches with little or no soil compaction  4 inadequate attachment to posts  5 failure to maintain the silt fence after installation  and 6 installing silt fence along property boundaries producing concentrated runoff silt fence is successful where 1 nonconcentrated sheet flow will occur  2 protection of adjacent property or waters of the united states is required  figure e22 silt fence failure appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development  the size of the drainage area is no more than 14 acre per 100 linear feet of silt fence  4 the maximum flow path length above the barrier is 100 feet 305 m  5 the maximum slope gradient above the barrier is   6 small swales are carrying silt where the slope is less than 2%  and 7 no practice other than a silt fence is feasible silt fence should not be used 1 across slopes even on contour  2 around the perimeter of the construction site unless jhooks andor smiles are used long continuous runs of silt fence will divert and concentrate sediment laden runoff and almost certainly result in failure  3 jhooks or smiles are preferable to linear installations a good rule of thumb is to drain no more than 13 acre of disturbed area into each discrete jhook or smile segment  and 4 silt fence must only be installed where water can pond when placed off contour silt fence will effectively divert runoff if that is desired c design considerations  typical silt fence specifications were written 25 years ago and have changed little since some states have recognized some of the inherent problems such as inadequate trench depth and implemented minor changes to improve efficacy time and experience has shown that the outdated construction specifications combined with the improper application and incorrect installation of silt fences has resulted in it being one of the most ineffective storm water pollution controls in use except for possibly hay bales during the most erosive storm events the silt particles carried by the sedimentladen runoff actually plug up the fabrics pore openings that is how the fabric prevents the discharge of silt however the fabric if properly installed and anchored will then pond water and sediment can begin to fall out of suspension the silt fence will have tremendous pressure exerted upon it failure will occur if too much water runoff is directed to the fence if the stakes are not of sufficient strength to support the tremendous forces or most importantly the fence is not keyed deeply into a trench or sliced and compacted such that runoff cannot go under or around the fence some general design considerations include 1 determine what kind of runoff and how much is coming onto the site  too much volume of water per silt fence area means failure will happen  2 determine where and how the total volume is going to exit  total drainage area is the prime consideration of silt fence quantity not necessarily slope  3 soil type can play a role in the placement and quantity requirements  sandy soils might require more silt fence per area to contain the volume of potential sediment  clay soils might need fewer figure e23 silt fence success figure e24 silt fence design appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development fences because the volume of potential sediment loss is less although the volume of water might be greater because clay soils allow less rainfall infiltration  4 type size and spacing of fence posts  wood posts are inadequate and should not be used except on flat lots  steel tposts weighing at least 125 lbs per feet  are preferred as they can be driven 24 inches into compacted soil which is necessary to hold a horizontal load 18 inches high and they can also be recycled and used repetitively  improper spacing of posts causes failures  table e4 silt fence and land slope design considerations a b land slope % maximum slope length behind fence in feet 1 <2 100

one season their principal mode of action is to slow and pond the water and allow soil particles to settle silt fences are not designed to withstand high heads of water and therefore should be located where only shallow pools can form their use is limited to situations in which sheet or overland flows are expected 2 install silt fence material into a trench 4 wide and at least 6 deep with vertical sides a preferred installation technique involves static slicing with an implement such as the tommy silt fence machine or equivalent the trench must be backfilled and compacted 3 install silt fences with smiles or jhooks to reduce the drainage area that any segment will impound appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development  silt fences placed at the toe of a slope shall be set at least 6 feet 18 m from the toe in order to increase ponding volume 5 the soil should be sliced and the fabric mechanically installed into the soil 6 the height of a silt fence shall not exceed 36 inches 09 m storage height and ponding height shall never exceed 18 inches 05 m 7 the ends of the fence should be turned uphill 8 steel support posts should be utilized properly spaced and driven into compacted soil place the posts on the downstream side of the fabric 9 post spacing shall not exceed 6 feet 18 m 10 the filter fabric is wiretied directly to the posts with three diagonal ties the slicing method has the capability to turn in a short distance thus properly installing silt fence where needed turning enables upturns on the ends of silt fence runs maneuvering around obstacles on construction sites protection along property lines and following the existing site contours e inspection and maintenance  1 inspect fence for proper installation and compaction by pulling up on the fence while kicking the toe of the fabric if the fence comes out of the ground do not accept the installation 2 if there are long linear runs of silt fence jhooks or smiles should be installed 3 sediment shall be cleaned from behind the fence when it reaches 50% of the designed impoundment height 9 inch 02 m 4 silt fences and filter barriers shall be inspected weekly after each significant storm 1 inch in 24 hours any required repairs shall be made immediately 5 silt fences shall be removed when they have served their useful purpose but not before the upslope area has been permanently stabilized and any sediment stored behind the silt fence has been removed appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development figure e26 silt fence installation appendix e  erosion and

e drop inlet sediment barriers  a definition  a drop inlet sediment barrier is a temporary barrier placed around a drop inlet the sediment barrier may be constructed of straw bales and gravel gravel and stone block and gravel or silt fence material note straw bale and silt fence drop inlet sediment barriers both have very high failure rates monitoring of these bmps reveals that these practices rarely prevent sediment discharge into the storm drains b purpose  drop inlet sediment barriers are intended to prevent sediment from entering the storm drains during construction operations this practice allows early use of the storm drain system and is applicable for the phased construction schedule of a wet weather plan sedimentladen runoff is ponded before entering the storm drain thus allowing some sediment to fall out of suspension c silt fence sediment barrier  1 support posts for a silt fence must be steel fence posts or 2 by 4 inch 51 by 102 mm wood length 3 foot 09 m minimum spacing 3 foot 09 m maximum with a top frame support required 2 excavate a trench 4 inches 101 mm wide and 6 inches 152 mm deep and bury the bottom of the silt fence in the trench 3 backfill the trench with gravel or soil 4 compact the backfill well 5 the height of the silt fence shall be a 15 foot 05 m maximum measured from the top of the inlet figure e30 improperly installed and unmaintained silt fence drop inlet barrier d gravel doughnut  1 keep the stone slope toward the inlet at  or flatter or use concrete blocks to help prevent the stone from being washed into the drop inlet a minimum 1 foot 03 m wide level area set 4 inches 101 mm below the drop inlet crest will add further protection against the entrance of material appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development figure e31 drainguard and grateguard 2 stone on the slope toward the inlet should be 3 inches 762 mm or larger for stability and 1 inch 254 cm or smaller on the slope away from the inlet to control flow rate 3 wire mesh with 2 inch 51 mm openings may be placed over the drain grating but must be inspected frequently to avoid blockage by trash if concrete blocks are used the openings should be covered with wire screen or filter fabric e silt saver  the silt saver is an inlet filter constructed of a reusable rigid plastic frame that fits over the inlet during construction the frame is covered by filter material that is curved upwards at the bottom so that soil may be used to hold the material in close contact with the ground independent testing of the silt saver has shown the product to be extremely successful at preventing sediment entry into the inlet this product works best when a depressed trap is excavated around the inlet to induce ponding this allows finer sediments time to fall out of suspension f drainguard and grateguard  these inlet filters have an excellent application for grate inlets in subdivisions after paving and during home construction the drainguard is available in a reusable model the drainguard has bypass holes for heavy flow situations both products are available in a sediment only and an oil and sediment model benefits include low to moderate cost and ease of installation and removal photos courtesy of ultratech g inspection and maintenance  1 inspect the barrier after each rain and promptly make repairs as needed 2 sediment shall be removed after each significant storm 1 inch 254 mm in 24 hours to provide adequate storage volume for the next rain 3 the removed sediment shall be deposited in an area that will not contribute sediment offsite and can be permanently stabilized 4 for gravel filters if the gravel becomes clogged with sediment it must be carefully removed from the inlet and either cleaned or replaced appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development figure e32 block and gravel drop inlet sediment barrier appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development e curb inlet sediment barriers  a definition  curb inlet sediment barriers are temporary barriers constructed from concrete block and gravel or gravel filled sandbags b purpose  curb inlet sediment barriers are intended to reduce the sediment discharged into storm drains by ponding the runoff and allowing the sediment to settle out the structures allow for overflow from high runoff events and the gravel allows the ponds to dewater rapidly c design considerations  the sandbag curb inlet and block and gravel sediment barrier can be used at curb inlets on gently sloping paved streets where 1 water can pond and allow sediment to separate out of suspension  2 runoff is relatively low less than 05 ft3sec 01 m3sec 3 once the small catchment areas behind the sandbags or block and gravel fill with sediment future sedimentladen runoff will enter the storm drain without being desilted therefore sediment must be removed from these structures during or after each storm additional storage can be obtained by constructing a series of sandbag barriers along the gutter so that each barrier traps small amounts of sediment d construction specifications  1 place the barriers on gently sloping streets where water can pond 2 the barriers must allow for overflow from a severe storm event slope runoff shall be allowed to flow over blocks and gravel and not be bypassed over the curb the sandbag should be of woventype geotextile fabric since burlap bags deteriorate rapidly the sandbags shall be filled with 34 inch 19 mm drain rock or 14 inch 6 mm pea gravel 3 the sandbags shall be placed in a curved row from the top of curb at least 3 feet 09 m into the street the row should be curved at the ends pointing uphill 4 several layers of bags should be overlapped and packed tightly 5 leave a onesandbag gap in the top row to act as a spillway for block and gravel type barriers 1 place two concrete blocks on their sides perpendicular to the curb at either end of the inlet opening these are the spacer blocks 2 place concrete blocks on their sides across the front of the inlet and abutting the spacer blocks the openings in the blocks should face outward not upward 3 cut a 2 by 4 inch 51 by 102 mm stud the length of the curb inlet plus the width of the two spacer blocks place the stud outer hole of each spacer block to help keep the front blocks in place 4 place wire mesh over the outside vertical face open ends of the blocks to prevent stone from being washed blocks 5 use chicken wire hardware cloth with 12 inch 13 mm openings or filter fabric 6 place 34 1 13 inch 1934 mm

streambank stabilization may take many forms including gabions and riprap gabions are rectangular wire baskets filled with stones used as pervious semiflexible building blocks live rooting branches may be placed between the rockfilled baskets b purpose  to protect streambanks from the erosive forces of moving water rockfilled gabions can be used to armor the bed andor banks of channels or used to divert flow away from eroding channel sections c conditions where practice applies  rockfilled or vegetated rock gabions are applicable to streambank sections which are subject to excessive erosion due to increased flows or disturbance during construction this practice is applicable where flow velocities exceed 6 feet sec 2 msec and where vegetative streambank protection alone is not sufficient gabions can be used to construct deflectors or groins intended to divert flow away from eroding streambank sections gabions are also used to construct retaining walls and grade control structures gabions and gabion mattresses which essentially are rock blankets consisting of a layer of rock encased by wire are often preferable to rock riprap alone for any given hydraulic condition the gabion or gabion mattress revetment thickness is one third 13 of an equivalent riprap design gabions and gabion mattresses are flexible and free draining thus allowing some soil settling they can be used in unstable streambeds and streambanks gabions can provide an important component to a bioengineering solution for streambank or slope erosion because they allow the growth and establishment of natural vegetation d site considerations  all of the general streambank stabilization considerations are to be followed the following are specific considerations for gabion structures gabion walls are appropriate where 1 the vertical integrity of a soil bank needs a higher tensile strength to reduce sloughing of the streambank 2 there is moderate to excessive subsurface water movements that may be creating erosion and damage other types of non permeable structures 3 an excessively steep stream bank must be stabilized and vegetative or extreme mechanical means of stabilization ie pulling back bank are not feasible due to site conditions 4 where slope must be modified while heavy machinery is unavailable to the site 5 fill must be disposed of along an eroding streambank fill can be placed behind gabion to modify slope 6 a retaining or toe wall is needed to stabilize the slope e types of gabion structures 1 gabion wall basically a gravity wall which relies on its own weight and frictional resistance to resist sliding and overturning from lateral earth pressure 2 vegetated rock gabion a rockfilled gabion earthretaining structure which has live branches placed between each consecutive layer of rockfilled baskets the live branches will take root inside the gabion and into the soil behind the structure the vegetation will consolidate the structures and bind it to the slope 3 gabion deflector deflector or groins project into the streams and divert flows away from eroding streambank sections appendix e  erosion and sediment control north augusta development  gabion aprons rock filled gabions or gabions mattress used as outlet protection energy dissipators or spillways these semiflexible gabions are designed to settle without fracture and adhere to the ground if scour occurs 5 grade control drop structures or weirs gabion baskets and mattresses can be combined to construct check dams or weirs 6 channel lining gabion mattresses can be used to line channels the lining thickness depends on many factors such as the type of rock design flow velocity sediment and bedload and channel gradient f vegetated riprap  vegetated riprap should be used where channel velocity does not require the use of gabions this practice is excellent when stabilization is needed but a more natural and aesthetically pleasing embankment is called for the vegetation will provide stream shading for temperature control as well as wildlife habitat and a contribution of organic matter to the stream ecosystem g construction specifications  1 gabions shall be fabricated in such a manner that the sides ends lid and diaphragms can be assembled at the construction site into rectangular baskets of the sizes specified and shown on the construction drawings 2 gabions shall be of singleunit construction  the base lid ends and sides shall be either woven into a single unit or one edge of these members connected to the base section of the gabion in such a manner that the strength and flexibility at the connecting point is at least equal to that of the mesh 3 where the length of the gabion exceeds 15 times its horizontal width the gabion shall be divided by diaphragms of the same mesh and gauge as the body of the gabion into cells whose length does not exceed the horizontal width 4 the stone size to fill gabion shall be 35 inches 76127 mm for gabion mattresses and 48 inches 101203 mm for gabion h inspection and maintenance  1 structural damage caused by storm events should be repaired as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the structure or erosion of

stormwater management as required by various provisions of this in conjunction with the design and development of conservation subdivisions provided for in of this modifications the city engineer may add to or modify the contents of this appendix when appropriate and for valid reasons to clarify or update best management practices associated with stormwater quality management such modifications shall be documented and forwarded to the planning commission as information in specific cases and for documented reasons the city engineer may waive the submission of documents or specific activities required herein the reasons for any such waiver shall be recorded in the project application file f2 stormwater quality f21 introduction designing stormwater management practices stps with water quality considerations is not a new practice but over time the science of water quality treatment has advanced and local regulations have tightened water quality has typically been addressed detention using a dry detention pond research has demonstrated that this method is not effective nor is it comparable to other types of treatments the north augusta stormwater management department smd requires treatment of the runoff from the first oneinch of rainfall from a project site the following equation may be used to determine the water quality volume wqv wqv   1inrva12 where a   site area acres where rv   005 + i where i   site impervious cover % this equation uses the runoff coefficient rv described in the simple method other simple regressions or methods could be used as a substitute to calculate the runoff volume regressions based on local data are preferred f tools of analysis  for quantitybased water quality sizing criteria several simple regressions can be used to calculate the runoff volume a few methodologies for methods that calculate onsite loads include appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development a the simple method is a way of calculating runoff and pollutant loads based on impervious cover rainfall and event mean concentration emc data for different water quality parameters this model has been expanded to incorporate subsurface flows as well in the simplified urban nutrient output model sunom b swimm is a model developed by the epa for analyzing stormwater quantity and quality associated with runoff from urban areas both singleevent and continuous simulation can be performed on catchments having storm sewers or combined sewers and natural drainage for prediction of flows stages and pollutant concentrations c slamm this model is based on small storm hydrology and pollutant runoff from urban land uses pollutant sources are identified and both structural and nonstructural stormwater practices can be accounted for in the model pollutant removal effectiveness of the practices found in this manual will obviously vary widely based on site conditions and practice design there are many programs available to determine pollutant removal rates for all practices covered here in addition vendors of proprietary treatment practices size their product based on specific site conditions a general overview of pollutant removal rates

extended detention pond figure f1 b wet pond figure f2 c wet extended detention pond figure f3 d multiple pond system figure f4 e pocket pond figure f5 dry extended detention ponds that have no permanent pool are not considered an acceptable option for meeting wqv due to poor pollutant removal and chronic maintenance problems appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development the term pocket refers to a pond or wetland that has such a small contributing drainage area that little or no baseflow is available to sustain water elevations during dry weather instead water elevations are heavily influenced and in some cases maintained by a locally high water table stormwater ponds can also be used to provide channel protection volume as well as overbank and extreme flood attenuation

quality north augusta development figure f3 wet extended detention pond appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f4 multiple pond system appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f5 pocket pond f pond feasibility  stormwater ponds should have a minimum contributing drainage area of ten acres or more unless groundwater is confirmed as the primary water source ie pocket pond this drainage area requirement ensures that the permanent pond can be maintained by the runoff from the contributing drainage a water balance analysis may replace this requirement in addition the specific drainage area requirements will vary based on regional rainfall and temperature stormwater ponds should not be located within jurisdictional waters including wetlands appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development f pond conveyance  conveyance should be provided which does not cause erosion when reinforced concrete pipe is used for the principal spillway to increase its longevity oring gaskets astm c361 should be used to create watertight joints f inlet protection  a forebay should be provided at each inlet unless the inlet provides less than 10% of the total design storm inflow to the pond inlet areas should be protected to reduce erosion inlet pipes to the pond can be partially submerged a sediment forebay is important for maintenance and longevity of a stormwater treatment pond each pond should have a sediment forebay or equivalent upstream pretreatment the forebay should consist of a separate cell formed by an acceptable barrier the forebay shall be sized to contain 01 inches per impervious acre of contributing drainage and should be 4 to 6 feet deep the forebay storage volume can count toward the total wqv requirement exit velocities from the forebay should be nonerosive direct maintenance access for appropriate equipment should be provided to the forebay a fixed vertical sediment depth marker should be installed in the forebay to measure sediment deposition over time the bottom of the forebay may be hardened to make sediment removal easier f adequate outfall protection  outfalls should be constructed such that they do not increase erosion or have undue influence on the downstream geomorphology of the stream flared pipe sections that discharge at or near the stream invert or into a steppool arrangement should be used at the spillway outlet the channel immediately below the pond outfall shall be modified to prevent erosion and conform to natural dimensions in the shortest possible distance typically by use of large riprap placed over filter cloth a stilling basin or outlet protection shall be used to reduce flow velocities from the principal spillway to nonerosive velocities if a pond daylights to a channel with dry weather flow care should be taken to minimize tree clearing along the downstream channel and to reestablish a forested riparian zone in the shortest possible distance excessive use of riprap should be avoided to reduce stream warming f pond treatment criteria  minimum water quality volume wqv provide water quality treatment storage to capture the computed wqv from the contributing drainage area combination of permanent pool extended detention wqved or marsh the following design considerations must be made a if ed is provided in a pond storage for cpved and wqved shall be computed and routed separately ie the wqv cannot be met simply by providing cpv storage for the one year storm need definition of cp b in the wet extended detention pond design at least 50% of the wqv should be stored in the permanent pool c the minimum length to width ratio for the pond is 1 ie length relative to width long flow paths and irregular shapes are recommended d the perimeter of all deep pool areas four feet or greater in depth should be surrounded by two benches 1 a safety bench that extends 15 feet outward from the normal water edge to the toe of the pond side slope the maximum slope of the safety bench shall be 6% appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development  an aquatic bench that extends up to 15 feet inward from the normal shoreline and has a maximum depth of eighteen inches below the normal pool water surface elevation f landscaping plan  wherever possible wetland plants should be encouraged in a pond design either along the aquatic bench fringe wetlands the safety bench and side slopes ed wetlands or within shallow areas of the pool itself the soils of a pond buffer are often severely compacted during the construction process to ensure stability the density of these compacted soils is so great that it effectively prevents root penetration and therefore may lead to premature mortality or loss of vigor consequently it is advisable to excavate large and deep holes around the proposed planting sites and backfill these with uncompacted topsoil existing trees should be preserved in the buffer area during construction planting guidance is provided in appendix c approved plants f maintenance measures  establishment of a maintenance plan is an important aspect of stp guidance on going maintenance is essential to ensure that stps operate properly and function as designed a maintenance responsibility for a pond and its buffer should be vested with a responsible authority by means of a legally binding and enforceable maintenance agreement that is executed as a condition of plan approval b the principal spillway should be equipped with a removable trash rack c sediment removal in the forebay should occur every 5 to 7 years or after 50% of total forebay capacity has been lost d a maintenance right of way or easement should extend to a pond from a public or private road maintenance access shall be at least 12 feet wide  have a maximum slope of no more than 15%  and should be appropriately stabilized to withstand maintenance equipment and vehicles e the maintenance access should extend to the forebay safety bench riser and outlet f nonclogging low flow orifice  a nonclogging low flow orifice must be provided the low flow orifice shall have a minimum diameter of 6 inches and shall be adequately protected from clogging by an acceptable external trash rack the preferred method is a submerged reverseslope pipe that extends downward from the riser to an inflow point one foot below the normal pool elevation an alternative method is to employ a broad crested rectangular vnotch or proportional weir protected by a halfround corrugated metal pipe cmp that extends at least 12 inches below the normal pool f riser in embankment  the riser shall be located within the embankment for maintenance access safety and aesthetics access to the riser is to be provided to the smd f pond drain  each pond shall have a drain pipe that can completely or partially drain the pond the drain pipe shall have an elbow within the pond to prevent sediment deposition and a diameter capable of draining the pond within 24 hours appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development f23 constructed wetlands stormwater wetlands are practices that create shallow marsh areas to treat urban stormwater and often incorporate small permanent pools andor extended detention storage to achieve the full wqv design variants include a shallow wetland figure f6 b ed shallow wetland figure f7 c pondwetland system figure f8 d

shallow wetland appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f8 pond  wetland system appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f9 pocket wetland f wetland feasibility  a water balance should be performed to demonstrate that a stormwater wetland can withstand a significant drought at summer evaporation rates without completely drawing down stormwater wetlands should not be located within existing jurisdictional wetlands in some isolated cases a permit may be granted to convert an existing degraded wetland in the context of local watershed restoration efforts appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development f wetland conveyance  flowpaths from the inflow points to the outflow points of stormwater wetlands shall be maximized a minimum flowpath of  length to relative width should be provided across the stormwater wetland this path may be achieved by constructing internal berms eg high marsh wedges or rock filter cells f wetland pretreatment criteria  sediment regulation is critical to sustain stormwater wetlands consequently a forebay should be located at the inlet and a micropool should be located at the outlet for forebay design criteria consult the previous section on ponds a micropool three to six feet deep should be used to protect the low flow pipe from clogging and prevent sediment resuspension f wetland treatment  a at least 25% of the wqv should be in deepwater zones with a depth greater than four feet the forebay and micropool may meet this criteria in addition the deepwater zones serve to keep mosquito populations in check by providing habitat for fish and other pond life that prey on mosquito larvae b a minimum of 35% of the total surface area can have a depth of six inches or less and at least 65% of the total surface area shall be shallower than 18 inches c if extended detention is utilized in a stormwater wetland the wqv ed volume should not comprise more than 50% of the total wqv and its maximum water surface elevation should not extend more than three feet above the permanent pool available data suggest that pond designs that rely entirely or primarily on detention have significantly compromised pollutant removal f wetland landscaping  a landscaping plan should be provided that indicates the methods used to establish and maintain wetland coverage minimum elements of a plan include delineation of pondscaping zones a selection of corresponding plant species a planting plan a sequence for preparing wetland bed including soil amendments if needed and sources of plant material a plant list is provided in appendix c approved plants the most common and reliable technique for establishing an emergent wetland community in a stormwater wetland is to transplant nursery stock obtained from local aquatic plant nurseries the following guidance is suggested when transplants are used to establish a wetland a to add diversity to the wetland five to seven species of emergent wetland plants should be planted b no more than half the wetland surface area needs to be planted if the appropriate planting depths are achieved the entire wetland should be colonized within three years c individual plants should be planted 18 inches on center in clumps d because most stormwater wetlands are excavated to deep subsoils they often lack the nutrients and organic matter needed to support vigorous growth of wetland plants at these sites three to six inches of topsoil or wetland mulch should be added to all depth zones in the wetland from one foot below the normal pool to six inches above e in some cases the use of volunteer wetlands allowing cattails and phragmites to colonize may be appropriate typically it will be difficult to maintain diversity in this case and volunteer wetlands may be a low cost alternative appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development f wetland maintenance criteria  if a minimum coverage of 50% is not achieved in the planted wetland zones after the second growing season a reinforcement planting will be required stormwater wetlands that are separated from jurisdictional wetlands and regularly maintained are typically not regulated under state and federal laws occasional removal of invasive species may be necessary f24 infiltration practices stormwater infiltration practices capture and temporarily store the wqv before allowing it to infiltrate into the soil over a two day period design variants include a infiltrationtrench figure f10 b infiltrationbasin figure f11 c infiltration planter box figure f12 appendix f

checkdams or other means design variants include a dry swale figure f14 b wet swale figure f15 c grass channels figure f16 appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f14 dry swale appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f15 wet swale appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f16 grass channel f open channel feasibility criteria  a

strips should be mowed as required during the growing season to maintain grass heights in the 4 to 6 inches range wet swales employing wetland vegetation do not require frequent mowing of the channel sediment buildup within the bottom of the channel or filter strip should be removed when 25% of the original wqv volume has been exceeded appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development f27 better site design f traditional culdesac alternatives  a description  culdesac alternatives are designs for endofstreet vehicle turnaround that replace the traditional culdesac and reduce the amount of impervious cover created in a residential neighborhood culdesacs are local access streets with a closed circular end that allows for vehicle turnarounds many of these culdesacs can have a radius of more than 40 feet from a stormwater perspective culdesacs create a huge bulb of impervious cover increasing the amount of stormwater runoff for this reason reducing the impervious area of culdesacs use of islands or eliminating them altogether can reduce the amount of impervious cover created at a site b there are two alternatives to the traditional 40foot culdesac approved for use in north augusta which create less impervious cover these include loop roads including the option of narrower oneway loop roads serving four to five homes or creating pervious islands in the middle of the traditional culdesac c applicability  culdesac alternatives can be applied in the design of residential commercial and mixeduse developments a center island can also be used as an infiltration or bioretention water quality treatment practice d maintenance considerations  if islands are constructed as part of a turnaround these areas will need to be maintained kept as a natural area the costs could be minimal bioretention areas will also require maintenance f open space design  a description  open space design also known as conservation development or cluster development is a better site design technique that concentrates dwelling units in a compact area in one portion of the development site in exchange for providing open space and natural areas elsewhere on the site the minimum lot sizes setbacks and frontage distances for the residential zone are relaxed in order to create the open space at the site open space designs have many benefits in comparison to the conventional subdivisions that they replace they can reduce impervious cover stormwater pollutants construction costs grading and the loss of natural areas in north augusta the planned development process is used to pursue this type of development it should also be noted that the benefits of open space design are amplified when combined with other better site design techniques such as culdesac alternatives and open channels b maintenance considerations  once established common open space and natural conservation areas must be managed by a responsible party able to maintain the areas in a natural state in perpetuity typically the open space is protected by legally enforceable deed restrictions conservation easements and maintenance agreements in most communities the authority for managing open space falls to a homeowner or community association or a land trust c annual maintenance tasks for open space managed as natural areas are almost nonexistent and the annual maintenance cost for managing an acre of natural area is less than $75 cwp 1998 it may be useful to develop a habitat plan for natural areas that may require periodic management actions d effectiveness  recent redesign research indicates that open space design can provide impressive pollutant reduction benefits compared to the conventional subdivisions they replace for example the center for watershed protection 1998 reported that nutrient export declined by 45% to 60% when two conventional appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development subdivisions were redesigned as open space subdivisions other researchers have reported similar levels of pollutant reductions when conventional subdivisions were replaced by open space subdivisions maurer 1996  de dnrec 1997  dreher 1994  and scccl 1995 in all cases the reduction in pollutants was due primarily to the sharp drop in runoff caused by the lower impervious cover associated with open space subdivisions and indeed in the redesign studies cited above impervious cover declined by an average of 34% when open space designs were utilized 1 along with reduced imperviousness open space designs provide a host of other environmental benefits lacking in most conventional designs these developments reduce potential pressure to encroach on resource and buffer areas as enough open space is usually reserved to accommodate resource protection areas as less land is cleared during the construction process the potential for soil erosion is also greatly diminished perhaps most importantly open space design reserves 25%  50% of the development site in green space that would not otherwise be protected preserving a greater range of landscapes and habitat islands that can support considerable diversity in mammals songbirds and other wildlife e cost considerations  open space developments can be significantly less expensive to build than conventional subdivisions most of the cost savings are due to savings in road building and stormwater management conveyance costs in fact the use of open space design techniques at a residential development in davis california provided an estimated infrastructure construction costs savings of $800 per home liptan and brown 1996 other examples demonstrate infrastructure costs savings ranging from 11 to 66% 1 while open space developments are frequently less expensive to build developers find that these properties often command higher prices than homes in more conventional developments several regional studies estimate that residential properties in open space developments garner premiums that are 5 to 32% higher than conventional subdivisions and moreover sell or lease at an increased rate in massachusetts cluster developments were found to appreciate 12% faster than conventional subdivisions over a twenty year period lacey and arendt 1990 2 in addition to being aesthetically pleasing the reduced impervious cover and increased tree canopy associated with open space development reduces the size and cost of downstream stormwater treatment facilities f alternative pavers  a description  alternative pavers are permeable or semipermeable surfaces that can replace asphalt and concrete and can be used for overflow parking lots and walkways from a stormwater perspective this is important because alternative pavers can replace impervious surfaces creating less stormwater runoff the two broad categories of alternative pavers are paving blocks and other surfaces including gravel cobbles wood mulch brick and natural stone b porous pavement  porous pavement is a more expensive but effective surface used to reduce runoff these products may be especially applicable to redevelopment areas porous pavement is targeted for driveways walking trails parking lots playgrounds open spaces and golf cart paths porous pavement techniques only work if the design engineer takes into account the proper selection of technique for the location the design is correct and the structure is built properly if any of these considerations are not done correctly the structure may fail appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development researchers at the university of georgia have identified nine categories of porous pavements below is a brief overview of each 1 decks are level or elevated wooden structures that can serve as porous pavements they are beneficial in situations where they can be built around existing environments such as wetlands 2 open celled paving grids are open spaces with ribbing in between they can be difficult to walk on and it takes time to grow turf over the grids they work well in open spaces they can be used in lowtraffic areas such as loading areas and emergency access lanes 3 opengraded aggregate is the most permeable material and the lowestcost that you can get about 30 to 40 percent of the material is void space and its permeability is measured in thousands of inches per hour 4 openjointed paving blocks are segmental pavers that can handle high weights and heavy traffic paving blocks are cement or plastic grids with gaps between them paving blocks make the surface more rigid and gravel or grass planted inside the holes allows for infiltration depending on the use and soil types a gravel layer can be added underneath to prevent settling and allow further infiltration 5 plastic geocells are plastic cells held together with ribs and filled with aggregate or turf they can be used for a variety of activities including emergencyaccess lanes auxiliary parking areas trails pedestrian and wheelchair access ways golf cart paths 6 porous asphalt can be used as an overlay on parking lots 7 pervious concrete is created by mixing water and cementlike materials into a paste that forms a thick coating around aggregate particles it contains little or no sand and forms a highly permeable surface it is advocated as a bmp by the epa it can be used in waste transfer stations and low traveled parking areas 8 porous turf is used by itself and with reinforcements it is used for parking lots and open spaces 9 soft paving materials such as wood mulch crushed shell and other organic material can be used for areas of pedestrian traffic c applicability  alternative pavers can replace conventional asphalt or concrete in parking lots driveways and walkways at the same time traffic volume and type can limit application for this reason alternative pavers for parking are recommended only for overflow areas in residential areas alternative surfaces can be used for walkways but are not ideal for areas that require handicap accessibility d siting and design criteria  accessibility climate soil type traffic volume and long term performance should be considered along with costs and stormwater quality controls when choosing paving materials soil types will affect the infiltration rates and should also be considered when using alternative pavers clay soils d soils will limit the infiltration on a site it is important to consider that failure of porous surfaces can occur these failures can be a result of poor design inadequate construction techniques low soil permeability heavier traffic use than designed for or resurfacing with a non porous material if you are considering these techniques for your projects strict adherence to the design standards and construction methods must be used e the durability and maintenance cost of alternative pavers also limits use to low traffic volume areas at the same time alternative pavers can abate stormwater management costs used in combination with other better site design techniques the cumulative effect on stormwater can be dramatic appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development f benefits  the most obvious benefit of utilizing alternative pavers includes reduction or elimination of other stormwater management techniques applied in combination with techniques like bioretention pollutant removal and stormwater management can be further improved g limitations  alternative pavers are not recommended for high traffic volumes for durability reasons access for wheelchairs is limited with alternative pavers in addition snow removal is also difficult since plows cannot be used sand can cause the system to clog and salt can be a potential pollutant h effectiveness  alternative pavers provide better water quality effectiveness than conventional asphalt or concrete and the range of effectiveness depends on the type of paver table f6 provides a list of pavers and the range of water quality effectiveness for

water quality from storm sewers and other devices but also remain cost effective this chapter will give a brief overview of the types of technologies that are available for use in storm treatment processes there are many other available techniques and technologies available appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development pollutant removal effectiveness of the practices found in this manual will obviously vary widely based on site conditions and practice design there are many programs available to determine pollutant removal rates for all practices covered here in addition vendors of proprietary treatment practices size their product based on specific site conditions a general overview of pollutant removal rates for some of the more common stps is presented in the following narrative most of the information presented regarding pollutant removal rates is represented by the company that promotes the specific product the city of north augusta has not verified that the removal rates are accurate and will expect that design engineers that intend to use these products verify the accuracy of the statements to the best of their ability f inground technologies  the following technologies are used within the storm water sewer system to separate and remove pollutants f storm pure catch basin inserts  for areas where potential pollutant loads are higher roadways parking lots loading areas a catch basin insert will provide greater protection to by filtering stormwater adss nyoplast division offers stormpure inserts the stormpure catch basin insert figure f17 a twostage unit that will fit into new or existing catch basins will remove suspended solids hydrocarbons and other pollutants rates of removal are available from the company figure f17 stormpure catch basin insert f cds unit continuous deflective separation  this technology that uses a nonblocking nonmechanical screening process to remove pollutants from storm water flow and combined sewer overflows figure f18 the unit captures fine sands and solids and are capable of removing more than 80% of annual tss from stormwater it is said to move 100% of floatables and 100% of particles that are equal to or greater than onehalf the size of the screen opening the system comes in an offline unit also the units come with a conventional oil baffle to control oil and grease they can be fitted with the cds media filtration system cartridges that can target project specific pollutants as well appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f18 inline cds unit f stormceptor  the stormceptor captures pollutants from stormwater as it passes system the system is based on an internal bypass system that eliminates up to 80% of tss and 98% of free oils and hydrocarbons figure f19 under normal operating conditions more than 90% of all storm events storm water flows into the upper chamber and is diverted by a sloped weir into the lower chamber flow is diverted by horizontal outlets around the walls of the lower chamber settling out coarse and fine sediments to the floor of the chamber petroleum products rise and become trapped beneath the fiberglass insert during infrequent high flow events less than 10% of all storm events storm water flows pass over the diverting weir into the downstream sewer system preventing scouring of previously trapped pollutants the high flow bypass prevents previously collected pollutants from scour and resuspension the inlet stormceptor takes the place of a traditional inlet structure in a storm sewer system the inlet stormceptor is ideal for small drainage areas such as truck loading bays electrical transformer stations and vehicle refueling stations appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f19 stormceptor device f vortechnics  the vortecnics system is available for manhole and vault configurations it is a filter technology system that removes very fine particulates it uses sedimentation floatation and filtration methods figure f20 vortechnics system is a concrete underground structure comprised of three chambers  an initial grit chamber that concentrates and deposits sediments an oil chamber and baffle wall that traps floatables and a flow control chamber the system removes 80% of total suspended solids figure f20 vortechnics system f ecostorm  the ecostorm consists of 2 circular concentric precast structures an outer structure forms the swirlchambervortex separator the inner cylinder serves as a floatables collection chamber and outlet chamber figure f21 appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development swirlchamber technology combined with vortex design principles effectively treat the stormwater by removing and retaining sediments and floatables from site runoff figure f21 ecostorm f stormtech  stormtech develops control systems for stormwater runoff that maintain the balance between land development and the protection of natural resources stormtech chambers have been subjected to advanced inground testing protocols and highlevel industry expert review they have been evaluated to support hs20 live loads following current aashto procedures for loads structural capacity and factor of safety when installed per stormtechs chamber installation instructions stormtech chambers are molded from polypropylene resin and chemicals typically found in stormwater runoff stormtech recommends using the isolator row inlet control system or a treatment train approach the isolator row has been tested for sediment removal efficiency and can be a standalone sediment control system the treatment train approach incorporates a pretreatment device prior to the isolator row and an eccentric header for coarse or heavy materials removal the isolator row is a row of chambers wrapped in filter fabric runoff is directed into the isolator row via a manhole or basin with a diversion weir when the isolator row reaches capacity storm water overtops the weir and flows to the other chambers header system appendix f  stormwater quality north augusta development figure f22 stormtech system f conspan stormvault  the stormvault mitigation system by conspan is a below grade detention and sedimentation vault stormwater is discharged with tss concentration of less than 20 mgl with a 95% level of confidence independent of influent concentrations or inflow volume detention time promotes sedimentation of particles less than 70 microns f filterra  filterra relies on a specially engineered high flow rate treatment system to provide exceptional pollutant removal monitoring data shows filterra can treat over 90% of the total annual volume of rainfall with maximum pollutant removal rates reaching 95% for total suspended solids 82% total phosphorus 76% total nitrogen and 91% heavy metals measured as cu the high pollutant removal efficiency is primarily due the multiple treatment systems inherent in its unique plant  soil

private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited  these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally this or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of this intended to minimize damage to public ordinance amending the north augusta development code page4 facilities and utilities including water and gas mains electric lines telephone lines sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions including temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs 92 general provisions  statutory

disrupts commerce and governmental services creates extraordinary public expenditure requirements for flood protection and relief and impairs the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities flood losses are also caused by occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages
