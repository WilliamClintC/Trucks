the former ch 55  5515519 and enacted a new ch 55 as set out herein the former ch 55 pertained to flood damage prevention and derived from iart 1  ac art 2 art 3  ag art 4  ad art 5  ad 41894   31797   71601 findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  1 32111 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  1 32111 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  1 32111 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them

provisions private property owners developers or builders shall be accountable for any erosion of their property or construction site which results in measurable accumulation of sedimentation in dedicated streets and alleys any accumulation deeper than one inch in dedicated streets alleys or offsite private property constitutes a violation of this policy 1 maximum use shall be made of vegetation to minimize soil loss 2 natural vegetation shall be retained wherever possible 3 where inadequate natural vegetation exists or where it becomes necessary to remove existing natural vegetation temporary controls shall be installed promptly to minimize soil loss and insure that erosion and sedimentation does not occur 4 erosion control plans shall be submitted to city engineer for approval prior to actual construction 5 wastes or disposal areas and construction roads shall be located and constructed in a manner that will minimize the amount of sediment entering streams and city storm sewers 6 when work areas or material sources are located in or adjacent to live streams such areas shall be separated from the stream by a dike or other barrier to keep sediment from entering a flowing stream care shall be taken during the construction and removal of such barriers to minimize the sediment transport into a stream 7 should preventative measures fail to function effectively the applicant shall act immediately to bring the erosion andor siltation under control by whatever additional means are necessary 8 runoff shall be diverted away from construction areas as much as possible 9 developers builders or owners of property shall permanently stabilize all disturbed areas prior to final acceptance of the subdivision project andor structure stabilization shall be accomplished use of perennial vegetative cover or other permanent means such as channel lining retaining wall etc b permanent erosion control permanent erosion controls are installed at or near end of the construction project when no further disturbance of the area will occur the purpose of these controls is to permanently minimize soil loss methods used to achieve minimal soil loss include restoring ground cover building retaining walls for steep slopes or reducing wave or water action by lining channels or shorelines with gabions jute mats vegetation or similar materials examples of typical permanent measures are vegetation cover using perennial plants headwalls stilling basins riprap tree wells gabions matting along channels retention lakes terracing and retaining walls c temporary erosion control temporary erosion control methods are used to abate sediment runoff from construction sites the application of control devices can yield significant water quality and drainage benefits at a minimal cost to the developer the erosion control measures can be grouped as barriers filter devices or routing devices d erosion control barriers the erosion control methods that can be classified as barriers include 1 straw bale sediment barrier  2 sandbag sediment barrier  3 check dam  and 4 sediment trap these measures trap sediment and prevent high runoff velocities which cause erosion barrier devices are illustrated in the erosion control barriers figures 29 and 30 the straw bale and the sandbag sediment barriers can reduce sediment loads significantly a sandbag barrier is more durable and should be used to withstand more intense storm events siltation berms and check dams are not as effective for sediment removal as the other types of barriers and operate best in storm events of limited intensity e erosion control filters filtering methods can be used in place of barriers filter devices allow runoff to pass retain sediment by filtration the types of filters available are 1 filter berm  2 filter fence  3 filter inlet  and 4 vegetation filter strip the erosion control filters figures 31 and 32 show some typical erosion control filters excellent sediment removal can be achieved using a filter berm fence or inlet the filter berm is constructed of rock and therefore is capable of withstanding heavier storm events than the filter fence or filter inlet in general the vegetation filter strip will operate less effectively than the other devices f routing devices only one method the flexible downdrain is classified strictly as a routing device a schematic of a downdrain is shown in figure 33 the purpose of the device is to convey waters down steep slopes or across highly erodible soils some of the methods classified under erosion control barriers can be used as routing devices to protect erodible areas sandbag sediment barriers and straw bale sediment barriers are both suitable for this purpose a routing device is an erosion prevention tool that can eliminate erosion problems on steep slopes and other critical areas it is not designed to capture any solids already moving with the water g performance erosion from construction sites can be a significant water quality problem developing areas are cleared of vegetation during construction leaving the soil exposed and susceptible to erosion runoff then transports eroded sediment from these areas and deposit it downstream the accumulation of silt in streams and ponds is a form of water pollution that is unattractive and impedes drainage prevention is a key aspect of erosion control many of the control methods presented herein can be placed in a manner that will protect highly erodible areas such as steep slopes the prevention of erosion requires prior planning to ascertain the placement of selected control methods the rewards of this planning will be a significant reduction in soil loss not only can soil loss be prevented but eroded soil can be recovered on the construction site and used for fill the particulate material in construction site runoff is generally heavier and larger than particulates in urban runoff these attributes facilitate the removal of the material whether the removal is by settling in a sediment trap or by filtration filter fence temporary sediment traps filters and routing devices can effectively control erosion for construction sites if properly applied these methods are used in an effort to control temporary increases in sediment loads a quantifiable assessment of performance is difficult because the nature of erosion control is more preventative than corrective a rough assessment of performance can be conducted by comparing the soil loss from a site with controls to the loss from a comparable site without controls h design considerations sediment traps and flexible drains are flow collection devices that will require hydraulic design an estimate of the peak design flow rate and runoff volume is necessary for proper sizing of these management methods runoff volume and peak flow are calculated based on the design storm design storms for temporary erosion control structures shall be based on the tenyear return frequency the design storm frequency for construction sites should consider several factors including 1 the length of time and size of construction activity  2 the severity of damage that could result to downstream waters if the design storm is exceeded  and 3 local concerns toward environmental protection i enforcement should proper erosion controls fail or become inoperative the city shall notify the owner builder or developer of the violation in writing the owner builder or developer has five days after being notified to begin correcting the problems if no corrections are started the city may revoke the development permit building permit or withhold issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final acceptance  51903 private utilities a general provisions

character of the access allowed to a roadway by applying criteria for the location spacing design and operation of driveways median openings and intersections in general access management has the goal of balancing the access intensity with the desired mobility function of a particular roadway for example access management criteria would typically allow the least intense access to arterial or highspeed facilities to minimize the interruption to traffic flow that results from frequent access points local streets on the other hand would typically have the highest allowable access intensity because the mobility function is less of a priority access management criteria are applied during the development review process or application procedure for modifications to existing access for developed property within the city of lewisville the application of access management criteria goes one step further in the management of access along corridors that are undergoing redevelopment in such corridors the development of and the granting of access to parcels was done years before access management was understood as a result many of the parcels have narrow frontage along roadways and driveways that are spaced much closer than many of the current recommended access management guidelines as such the city has developed a driveway spacing standard that takes into account these existing parcels and balances the need for mobility and access along those corridors undergoing redevelopment 1 benefits of access management access management is one key to preserving the capacity of a particular facility by minimizing turbulence and speed reduction caused by driveway ingress and egress and proper use of auxiliary lanes at driveway and street intersections on  the texas department of transportation txdot implemented an access management policy that documented many of the benefits of access management these benefits include improvements in free flow speed and a reduction in the potential for accidents by minimizing speed differentials between vehicles and turning vehicles research has shown that accident rates increase consistently with an increase in access density while accident rates decrease with the construction of raised medians and controlled crossaccess finally access management has been shown to have an overall positive economic effect on communities and transportation corridors proper access management preserves the flow of traffic within and thus supporting the transportation needs of retail and commercial development while providing improved mobility for commuters numerous studies have shown that access management has little or no adverse impact on individual business activity and that corridors with completed access management projects had better retail sales when compared to surrounding communities 2 purpose of the access management policy this access management policy is needed in the city for four main reasons first an access management policy will establish a consistent means of reviewing access requests to achieve the benefits described above second this access management policy will support the city thoroughfare plan by allowing different levels of access intensity for roadways based on the intended function third the access management policy will establish guidelines for managing access along redevelopment corridors and finally txdot will allow municipalities to review and approve access locations and designs on txdot roadways within the municipality if the municipality has an approved access management policy and the proposed access is consistent with the approved policy 3 engineering basis the access management criteria are based upon accepted engineering principles and draw upon work included in the txdot access management manual and roadway design manual the aashto policy on the geometric design of highways and streets and the transportation research boards access management manual the criteria are based on satisfying safe stopping requirements traffic signal operation and the ability to construct deceleration leftturn or rightturn lanes for driveways and intersections 4 application of access management criteria the city access management criteria are based on the functional classification of a facility as described in the citys thoroughfare plan and shown in table 1 below table 1 functional classification description frontage roads 2 or 3lane frontage roadways principle arterials p6d 6lane divided roadway p4d 4lane divided roadway collectors c4u 4lane undivided roadway c2u 2lane undivided roadway local streets 2lane roadway 5 administration of policy this policy will be administered by the city engineer or his designee 6 deviation and dispute resolution process deviations to these criteria may be approved by the city engineer disputes will be deferred to and resolved by the city council variance process established in the citys general development ordinance all access management disputes must be accompanied by a traffic impact analysis paid for by the developer per city development procedures a deviation may be granted when both the city engineer and a development interest mutually agree that specific criteria cant be met because of physical limitations on a lot or parcel in those cases the deviation will come as close as physically possible to meeting the applicable criteria a dispute occurs when the city engineer and a development interest are not able to agree that a deviation is necessary due to physical limitations of the property or is as physically close as possible to meeting the established criteria 7 engineering study and tias an engineering study or traffic impact analysis tia may be required by the city engineer or initiated per the citys general development ordinance should an engineering study be required it shall at a minimum include the following elements trip generation trip distribution and traffic assignment at the proposed access points additionally the engineering study may require that existing traffic volume data be collected including turning movement volumes at intersections the trip generation will be conducted using the latest edition of the institute of transportation engineers trip generation manual unless there is acceptable data that supports the use of another trip generation source trip distribution will be performed with input from city staff and may require the use of the citys travel demand model the traffic assignment will be conducted to determine the forecasted turning movements attributable to the proposed development the existing traffic counts will be grown using an annual growth rate as agreed to by the city to the buildout year of the proposed development passby trips will be addressed using accepted practices as recommended in by the institute of transportation engineers the resulting traffic volumes will be used as background traffic volumes and the assigned forecasted turning movements will be added to the background traffic volumes resulting in the total traffic volumes if a tia is required by the city it shall at a minimum include the above mentioned elements as well as the same type of data for intersections adjacent to the proposed site specific study limits to be defined by the city additionally the tia may require operational analyses including los and capacity analyses for the study intersections as determined during the initial meeting between the applicant and the city furthermore the applicants tia shall include recommendations for mitigation measures should the impact of the proposed access points result in unacceptable levels of service 8 permitting access to city and state controlled roadways shall require a permit a permit will be granted only after due consideration of safety traffic flow and conflicts with existing and proposed facilities in addition to the above application for a driveway permit can be made as part of the engineering site plan request or as a separate request driveway permit applications shall contain sufficient information to allow the city to fully assess the access location and adequacy of the proposed driveway design the authority for granting access to state facilities rests with the texas department of transportation txdot txdot may grant permitting authority to

the distances listed in the table above are to be measured from the near radius points between driveways as shown in figure 3 in addition to meeting the driveway spacing criteria all driveways must be located outside the limits of deceleration lanes serving the next adjacent driveway or intersection and designed such that adequate stopping sight distance is provided exceptions to the above criteria will be reviewed where properties would be denied access under this criteria and where access properties via developers agreements or access easements is not feasible requests for deviation to these criteria must be supported by an engineering study and approved by the city engineer 3 shared access mutual use access into and across adjacent property boundaries will be required for all new developments where it is deemed feasible this practice ensures that all properties are allowed full access to the roadway system thus minimizing undesirable traffic patterns and turning movements at nearby intersections 4 median openings median openings can be particularly problematic due to the impact on traffic flow from leftturning and crossing maneuvers for this reason it is critical that median opening spacing be established to minimize the impacts on nearby intersections or driveways median openings must be spaced in accordance with table 2 street design criteria and to accommodate fullydeveloped leftturn bays in both directions refer to section on auxiliary lanes median opening spacing must also be sufficient to avoid interfering with the advance detectors of a nearby signalized intersection requests for deviation must be supported by an engineering study and approved by the city engineer when a dispute arises requests for a variance to the median opening spacing criteria must be accompanied by a traffic impact analysis tia and approved by the city engineer before consideration by the city council txdot will continue to have authority over the placement and design of median openings on state facilities 5 modified hooded median openings in some situations it is beneficial to prevent exiting traffic from making a lefthand or crossing maneuver typical applications of hooded median openings would be where crossaccess driveways of major retail centers align adjacent to any intersection that includes an arterial or collector or in a retrofit situation where accident history indicates a safety problem at a median opening the proposed modified median opening must be located such that fullydeveloped leftturn bays can be established in both directions of traffic flow requests for deviation to the median opening spacing criteria must be supported by an engineering study and approved by the city engineer when a dispute arises requests for a variance

connection fees see the citys fee ordinance  6203 erosion control a general provisions private property owners developers or builders shall be accountable for any erosion of their property or construction site that results in measurable accumulation of sedimentation in dedicated streets and alleys any accumulation deeper than one inch in dedicated streets alleys or offsite private property constitutes a violation of this policy 1 maximum use shall be made of vegetation to minimize soil loss 2 natural vegetation shall be retained wherever possible 3 where inadequate natural vegetation exists or where it becomes necessary to remove existing natural vegetation temporary controls shall be installed promptly to minimize soil loss and insure that erosion and sedimentation does not occur 4 erosion control plans shall be submitted to city engineer for approval prior to actual construction 5 wastes or disposal areas and construction roads shall be located and constructed in a manner that will minimize the amount of sediment entering streams and city storm sewers 6 when work areas or material sources are located in or adjacent to live streams such areas shall be separated from the stream by a dike or other barrier to keep sediment from entering a flowing stream care shall be taken during the construction and removal of such barriers to minimize the sediment transport into a stream 7 should preventative measures fail to function effectively the applicant shall act immediately to bring the erosion andor siltation under control by whatever additional means are necessary 8 runoff shall be diverted away from construction areas as much as possible 9 developers builders or owners of property shall permanently stabilize all disturbed areas prior to final acceptance of the subdivision project andor structure stabilization shall be accomplished use of perennial vegetative cover or other permanent means such as channel lining retaining wall etc b permanent erosion control permanent erosion controls are installed at or near end of the construction project when no further disturbance of the area will occur the purpose of these controls is to permanently minimize soil loss methods used to achieve minimal soil loss include restoring ground cover building retaining walls for steep slopes or reducing wave or water action by lining channels or shorelines with gabions jute mats vegetation or similar materials examples of typical permanent measures are vegetation cover using perennial plants headwalls stilling basins riprap tree wells gabions matting along channels retention lakes terracing and retaining walls c temporary erosion control temporary erosion control methods are used to abate sediment runoff from construction sites the application of control devices can yield significant water quality and drainage benefits at a minimal cost to the developer the erosion control measures can be grouped as barriers filter devices or routing devices d erosion control barriers the erosion control methods that can be classified as barriers include 1 straw bale sediment barrier  2 sandbag sediment barrier  3 check dam  and 4 sediment trap these measures trap sediment and prevent high runoff velocities that cause erosion barrier devices are illustrated in the erosion control barriers figures 2933 the straw bale and the sandbag sediment barriers can reduce sediment loads significantly a sandbag barrier is more durable and should be used to withstand more intense storm events siltation berms and check dams are not as effective for sediment removal as the other types of barriers and operate best in storm events of limited intensity e erosion control filters filtering methods can be used in place of barriers filter devices allow runoff to pass retain sediment by filtration the types of filters available are 1 filter berm  2 filter fence  3 filter inlet  and 4 vegetation filter strip the erosion control filters figures 2933 show some typical erosion control filters excellent sediment removal can be achieved using a filter berm fence or inlet the filter berm is constructed of rock and therefore is capable of withstanding heavier storm events than the filter fence or filter inlet in general the vegetation filter strip will operate less effectively than the other devices f routing devices only one method the flexible downdrain is classified strictly as a routing device a schematic of a downdrain is shown in figure 33 the purpose of the device is to convey waters down steep slopes or across highly erodible soils some of the methods classified under erosion control barriers can be used as routing devices to protect erodible areas sandbag sediment barriers and straw bale sediment barriers are both suitable for this purpose a routing device is an erosion prevention tool that can eliminate erosion problems on steep slopes and other critical areas it is not designed to capture any solids already moving with the water g performance erosion from construction sites can be a significant water quality problem developing areas are cleared of vegetation during construction leaving the soil exposed and susceptible to erosion runoff then transports eroded sediment from these areas and deposit it downstream the accumulation of silt in streams and ponds is a form of water pollution that is unattractive and impedes drainage prevention is a key aspect of erosion control many of the control methods presented herein can be placed in a manner that will protect highly erodible areas such as steep slopes the prevention of erosion requires prior planning to ascertain the placement of selected control methods the rewards of this planning will be a significant reduction in soil loss not only can soil loss be prevented but also eroded soil can be recovered on the construction site and used for fill the particulate material in construction site runoff is generally heavier and larger than particulates in urban runoff these attributes facilitate the removal of the material whether the removal is by settling in a sediment trap or by filtration filter fence temporary sediment traps filters and routing devices can effectively control erosion for construction sites if properly applied these methods are used in an effort to control temporary increases in sediment loads a quantifiable assessment of performance is difficult because the nature of erosion control is more preventative than corrective a rough assessment of performance can be conducted by comparing the soil loss from a site with controls to the loss from a comparable site without controls h design considerations sediment traps and flexible drains are flow collection devices that will require hydraulic design an estimate of the peak design flow rate and runoff volume is necessary for proper sizing of these management methods runoff volume and peak flow are calculated based on the design storm design storms for temporary erosion control structures shall be based on the tenyear return frequency the design storm frequency for construction sites should consider several factors including 1 the length of time and size of construction activity  2 the severity of damage that could result to downstream waters if the design storm is exceeded  and 3 local concerns toward environmental protection i enforcement should proper erosion controls fail or become inoperative the city shall notify the owner builder or developer of the violation in writing the owner builder or developer has five days after being notified to begin correcting the problems if no corrections are started the city may revoke the development permit building permit or withhold issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final acceptance  6203 private utilities a general provisions in the course of development the services of other private utility agencies may be required in addition gas and electrical service shall be available to each lot prior to the issuance of a building permit 1 telephone 2 gas 3 electric 4 cable 5 solid waste b underground utilities in areas where no overhead utility lines currently exist all new utility lines of 60kv and below shall be placed underground in areas where overhead utility lines exist the utility companies may augment upgrade repair replace and maintain as necessary relocations may take place based on no change in the character of service overhead lines may be relocated overhead and underground lines shall be relocated underground the utility companies shall be responsible for developing administrative policies and cost reimbursement procedures for the installation and extension of underground facilities these policies should permit the utility companies to recover the cost differential between the cost of extending and installing overhead and underground service in the event the city or a developer requests such facilities from the utility companies all utilities shall be constructed and installed in

the community for decades and retains many buildings that convey its early character this area contains numerous buildings with traditional architectural styles that enhance the communitys quality of life as well as the economy of the community maintaining and enhancing an old town look and feel is critical to the success of old town in recent years citizens and business leaders have come to recognize that the character of development in this area is of community interest this area contains the original downtown or commercial center for the city as well as the original residential neighborhoods that surround and supported the downtown major commercial streets lead downtown and the area also incorporates some blocks of buildings that were originally residential and have been adapted to commercial uses these design guidelines are written to assure that providing direction for future improvements in the old town area enhances revitalization efforts and protects property investments the city wishes to protect those historic resources that exist in old town and to revitalize the area by encouraging new development and building rehabilitation however new development and building rehabilitation must be done in a manner that compliments and supports the areas existing look and feel towards this goal the old town design district and old town center design district have been established to protect and enhance the older architectural styles found in the old town area of the city the boundaries of the district are college street as the northern boundary railroad street on the east purnell street as the southern boundary and stemmons freeway ih 35e on the west appendix a this section provides basic requirements as well as guidance for improvements to all properties and types of work within the old town design district and old town center design district the guidelines are for property and business owners planning exterior alterations additions to or the rehabilitation of existing buildings they also apply to the design and construction of new singlefamily residential multifamily residential commercial office medical and industrial buildings the guidelines will assist interested parties in understanding the aesthetic character of the buildings and environment in which they live and assist owners when they are faced with decisions about renovation repair maintenance rehabilitation and new construction the guidelines are not a rigid set of rules and do not require that buildings be restored to an historic period or style rather their purpose is to provide 1 guidance to property owners and tenants about buildings their distinctive characteristics and how to maintain them  2 various appropriate ways to address design repair and rehabilitation issues  3 good maintenance practices  and 4 appropriate ways to design new compatible infill buildings  6203 why have design guidelines the design guidelines provide a basis for making decisions about the appropriate treatment of traditional resources and compatible new construction they also serve as a planning tool for property and business owners and design professionals who seek to make improvements that may affect older resources while the design guidelines are written such that they can be used by the layman to plan improvements property owners are strongly encouraged to enlist the assistance of qualified design and planning professionals including architects and engineers  6203 how are the guidelines used a the old town design review committee is authorized to enforce these old town design standards for new construction and renovations by hearing and deciding applications for letters of design approval while the design committee may be flexible in applying these standards to projects the intent of these regulations is ensure that new construction and renovations have the appearance of belonging in old town property owners real estate agents developers tenants and architects should use the guidelines contained in this document when considering a project for any project subject to review the applicant should refer to these guidelines early in the project planning to avoid planning efforts that later may prove to be inappropriate it is also important to recognize that in each case a unique combination of design variables is at play and as a result the degree to which each relevant guideline must be met may vary in making its determination of the appropriateness of a project otdrcs overall concerns are that 1 the proposed work generally complies with the criteria in these standards 2 the integrity of an individual historic structure is preserved as much as possible 3 new buildings or additions are designed to be compatible with surrounding properties 4 the overall character of old town is protected b the design review process is reactive in that it only applies to proposed actions initiated by a property owner while it guides an approach to certain design problems by offering alternative solutions it does not dictate a specific outcome and it does not require a property owner to instigate improvements that are not contemplated while ordinary repair and maintenance does not usually require approval a letter of design approval is necessary for any change to the exterior of a building that requires a building permit seemingly unimportant changes like enclosing a porch can have a dramatic effect on the visual character of an existing resource and therefore are of concern to the city 1 the proposed work generally complies with the criteria in these standards 2 the integrity of an individual historic structure is preserved as much as possible 3 new buildings or additions are designed to be compatible with surrounding properties 4 the overall character of old town is protected  6203  i 92004 old town center design district a goal statement the old town center design district should continue to develop in a coordinated manner so that an overall sense of visual continuity is achieved the dominant character of this area should be that of a retailoriented commercial environment with an active street edge that is inviting to pedestrians while also accommodating automobiles development should include a mix of building types including older structures and compatible newer ones each should reflect the design trends of its own time while also contributing to a sense of visual continuity and strengthening the pedestrian experience in addition a combination of uses is encouraged including residential office and retail b key principles 1 building setbacks buildings in commercial areas are aligned immediately at the inside edge of the sidewalk this contributes to a sense of visual continuity a typical building in the old town center also has its primary entrance oriented to the street this helps establish a pedestrianfriendly quality in most cases similar entryways are evenly spaced along a block creating a rhythm that also contributes to the sense of visual continuity these entrances are also typically recessed from the sidewalk edge and have a clearly defined primary entrance for most commercial buildings this should be a recessed entryway secondary public entrances to commercial spaces are also encouraged on a larger building structures in the old town center should contribute to a strong building wall along the street a new building should align at the front lot line and be built out to the full width of the parcel ie to the side lot lines although small gaps can occur between some structures these are exceptions 2 mass and scale patterns are created along the street by the repetition of similarly sized building elements for example uniform facade widths evenly spaced in downtown create a rhythm that contributes to the visual continuity of the area 3 building form one of the most prominent unifying elements of the old town center is the similarity in building form commercial buildings are simple rectangular solids deeper than they are wide this characteristic is important and should be continued also commercial roof forms appear flat although there is typically a slight pitch to it for water to drain this characteristic is important and should be preserved 4 materials building materials of new structures should contribute to the visual continuity of the area they should appear similar to those seen traditionally to establish a sense of visual continuity brick and cast stone are the dominant materials and their use in new construction is preferred 5 architectural character the street level floors of traditional commercial buildings are clearly distinguishable from the upper floors first floors are predominantly fixed plate glass with a small percentage of opaque materials upper floors are the reverse opaque materials dominate and windows appear as smaller openings puncturing the solid walls the floortofloor height on the street level is also generally taller than the upper floors this feature should also be expressed in new construction c design elements this section presents design guidelines for individual building elements that are influential to the overall character of old town buildings when the elements are appropriately use in combination with oneanother buildings will reflect an appropriate look and feel that is consistent with the goals of the old town center within each element are individual goals and design guidelines statements upon which the city will base its decisions as to the appropriateness of any new or remodeled structure 1 the architectural style of all new and rehabilitate buildings in the old town center should be consistent and compatible with traditional buildings of the area while it is important that buildings be compatible with the surrounding traditional commercial context it is not necessary that they imitate older building styles the property owner is encouraged to use the one of the styles listed below or an appropriate variation in designing the overall character of their building a new interpretations of traditional building styles are encouraged b a new design that draws upon the fundamental similarities among older buildings in the area without copying them is preferred this will allow the building to be seen as a product of its own time and yet be compatible with its historic neighbors c buildings that are similar in scale and overall character to those seen historically are strongly encouraged d infill should be a balance of new and old in design e this applies to architectural details as well as the overall design of a building italianatecirca 18851900 originally inspired by farmhouses found in northern italy this blending of classical and romantic features became one of the most popular of the picturesque styles in the united states because of its ornate details such as bracketed cornices this style was easily adapted to simple buildings and storefronts as the details and features of this style were capable of being interpreted in wood masonry or iron it was also very adaptable in the various regions of the country with this adaptability and the sensibilities of the times its popularity grew for commercial buildings characteristics tall narrow doublehung windows often with arched or round arch heads commonly referred to as punched windows as opposed to ribbon windows windowpanes are either oneoverone or twoovertwo protruding sills quoins at building corners double doors with glass panels transom often curved above the front door brackets modillions and dentil courses flat roof with ornate cornices decorative paired brackets vernacular commercial storefrontscirca 19001920 usually between one and four stories the vernacular commercial building is divided horizontally into two distinct bands the first floor is more commonly transparent so goods can be displayed while the second story is usually reserved for residential or storage space a steel beam that spans the glass opening typically supports the upper floor however many onestory examples also exist a kick plate is found below the display window while above the display window a smaller band of glass a transom is seen also the main door is frequently recessed these buildings have stone and brick facades ornamental detail exists but is simple limited to a shallow molding such as a cornice some cornices were made of masonry while others were made of stamped metal many carry simplified italianate detailing in essence these buildings lack distinctive detail contrasting them with the revival styles that were also popular during this period characteristics castiron supported storefronts large display windows transom lights kickplate recessed entry tall second story windows cornice 2 the use of traditional building materials found in the area should be continued a materials shall appear to be similar to those used traditionally b brick and cast stone were the traditional materials and are preferred c a simple material finish is encouraged for a large expanse of wall plane d a matte or nonreflective finish is preferred e polished stone should be avoided as a primary material f use the gentlest means possible to clean the surface of a structure harsh cleaning methods such as sandblasting can damage the historic materials changing their appearance such procedures are inappropriate g original building materials or features shall not be covered synthetic stucco panelized brick vinyl aluminum or other composite siding materials are not appropriate h removing later covering materials that have not achieved historic significance is encouraged i in some instances a later covering may have achieved historic significance especially if it was applied early in the buildings history when this is the case the later covering may be maintained on the structure j an applicant may not reside a building with another covering material if one already exists removing the covering to expose the original material is appropriate in such a case once the covering siding has been removed repair the original underlying material the appropriate use of color can be used to embellish building facade elements and enhance the attractive details of commercial buildings and should not disguise or overpower them colors should compliment neighboring buildings and reflect a traditional color palette extremely bright fluorescent or neon colors shall not be permitted as the primary color on the facades of buildings in the old town design district only colors similar to or comparable to the palette adopted by the national trust for historic preservation will be allowed 3 maintain the traditional mass size and form of buildings seen along the street ie a building should be a rectangular mass that is one to threestories in height a buildings mass and size is its exterior bulk and form is its shape in its relationship to its adjoining buildings and to its userspedestrians a they are rectangular in shape deeper than wide b building heights vary in the old town center and yet there is a strong sense of similarity in scale c facades and sidewalls are rectangular d sidewalls should avoid long monotonous uninterrupted walls e building wall offsets including projections recesses changes in floor level or changes of materials should be used to add architectural variety and interest and to relieve the visual impact of a blank wall f individual buildings are attached often sharing interior sidewalls g while buildings may span several of the 20 to 30foot wide properties the individual lot width is still expressed as a distinct bay or module buildings should reflect this pattern h traditional floor heights should be expressed with horizontal moldings alignment of windows and other architectural details i floortofloor heights shall appear to be similar to those seen traditionally in particular the windows in a building should appear similar in height to those seen traditionally windowsills moldings and cornices are among those elements that may be seen to align j the character of the roof is a major feature for most historic structures when repeated along the street the repetition of similar roof forms contributes to a sense of visual continuity for the old town center k roofs are flat hidden by a parapet wall which add architectural character l parapets on side facades should step down towards the rear of the building m gable roof forms may also be considered if they are obscured by a false front storefront similar to those seen historically false front pediment and flat roof with parapet n a parapet wall should not be altered especially those on primary elevations or highly visible facades o when a parapet wall becomes deteriorated there is sometimes a temptation to lower or remove it avoid doing this because the flashing for the roof is often tied into the parapet and disturbing it can cause moisture problems p avoid waterproofing treatments which can interfere with the parapets natural ability to dry out quickly when it gets wet 4 design commercial buildings with architectural elements similar to those seen traditionally ie a commercial building should include recessed entries display windows kickplates transom windows midbelt cornices cornices or pediments and vertically oriented upperstory windows architectural elements are the individual components of a building including walls doors windows cornices parapets roofs pediments and other features ornamentation and details of elements such as cornices and parapets are original components that dress up a building and give it a sense of style and character ornamental items include hoodmolds trim at doors and windows  plaques and medallions  signboards or sign panels  date or name stones  and simple geometric shapes in metal stone or concrete for a commercial storefront building a rehabilitation or new project should preserve or include as many as possible these defining elements cornices which are usually found at the top of building walls and ornamental moldings or belt courses which are located just above storefronts are horizontal projecting elements that provide a visual break in or termination to a wall a parapet is an upward extension of a building wall above the roofline sometimes ornamental capped with brick stone or tile and frequently decorative elements or panels are placed in it and sometimes plain used to give a building a greater feeling of height or a better sense of proportion commercial buildings should for the most part all relate to the street and to pedestrians in the same manner with a clearly defined primary entrance and large display windows the repetition of these standard elements creates a visual unity on the street that should be preserved a display windows the main portion of glass on the storefront where goods and services are displayed this will help maintain the interest of the street to pedestrians by providing views to goods and activities inside first floor windows b transom the upper portion of the display window separated by a frame c kickplate found beneath the display window sometimes called a bulkhead panel d entry usually set back from the sidewalk in a protected recess e upperstory windows windows located above the street level these usually have a vertical orientation f cornice molding a decorative band at the top of the building design elements storefronts a alternative designs that are contemporary interpretations of traditional storefronts may be considered b where the original is missing and no evidence of its character exists a new design that uses the traditional elements may be considered however the new design should continue to convey the character of typical storefronts including the transparent character of the display window c retain the kickplate as a decorative panel the kickplate located below the display window adds interesting detail to the streetscape and should be preserved if the original kickplate is covered with another material consider exposing the original design if the original kickplate is missing develop a sympathetic replacement design wood is an appropriate material for replacements on most styles however ceramic tile and masonry may also be considered when appropriately used with the building style kickplate replacement d significantly increasing or decreasing the amount of glass will negatively affect the integrity of a structure e on traditional storefronts first floors should be more transparent than upper floors upper floors should appear more solid than first floors f avoid a blank wall appearance that does not provide interest to pedestrians g large surfaces of glass are inappropriate on the upper floors and sides of commercial buildings if necessary divide large glass surfaces into smaller windows that are in scale with those seen traditionally entrances a maintain recessed entries where they are found b the repetition of recessed entries provides a rhythm of shadows along the street which helps establish a sense of scale c these recessed entries were designed to provide protection from the weather and the repeated rhythm of these shaded areas along the street helps to identify business entrances typically recessed entries were set back between three and five feet d restore the historic recessed entry if it has been altered e avoid doors that are flush with the sidewalk especially those that swing outward f where entries were not recessed historically maintain them in their original position however one may also need to comply with other code requirements including door width direction of swing and construction in some cases entries must comply with accessibility requirements of the americans with disabilities act note however that some flexibility in application of these other regulations is provided for historic properties g building entrances should appear similar to those used traditionally in the block h clearly define the primary entrance with an awning canopy or other architectural or landscape feature i secondary public entrances are also encouraged on a larger building or along an alley if there is parking in the rear of the site windows and doors windows and doors are some of the most important characterdefining features of older structures they give scale to buildings and provide visual interest to the composition of individual facades distinct window and door designs in fact help define many building styles windows and doors often are inset into relatively deep openings or they have surrounding casings and sash components that have a substantial dimension that cast shadows which also contributes to the character of the historic style a typical upperstory window is twice as tall as it is wide these proportions are within a limited range  therefore upperstory windows in new construction should relate to the window proportions seen traditionally features important to the character of a window include its clear glass frame sash muntins mullions glazing sills heads jambs moldings operation location and relation to other windows features important to the character of a door include the door itself doorframe screen door threshold glass panes paneling hardware detailing transoms and flanking sidelights a retain the original shape of the transom glass in historic storefronts transoms the upper glass band of traditional storefronts introduced light into the depths of the building saving on light costs these bands should not be removed or enclosed b the shape of the transom is important to the proportion of the storefront and it should be preserved in its historic configuration c if the original glass is missing installing new glass is preferred d preserve the position number size and arrangement of historic windows and doors in a building wall many windows are oneoverone in that a single pane of glass is in both the upper and lower sashes others are twooverone with two panes or lights in the upper sash and one is in the lower sash these arrangements are preferred e enclosing an historic opening in a key characterdefining facade is inappropriate as is adding a new opening f do not close down an original opening to accommodate a smaller window restoring original openings which have been altered over time is encouraged g traditionally windows had a vertical emphasis the proportions of these windows contribute to the character of each residence and commercial storefront h if it is broken or has been removed in the past consider replacing it with new glass if security is a concern consider using wire glass tempered glass or light metal security bars preferably on the interior i installing window airconditioners in windows on building fronts is inappropriate j a new or replacement window or door should match the appearance of the original while replacing an entire window or door is discouraged it may be necessary in some cases although wood is preferred as a replacement material metal is common on the market today and sometimes is suggested for replacement it is possible to consider alternative materials if the resulting appearance matches the original as closely as possible the substitute also should have a demonstrated durability in this climate k very ornate windows or doors that are not appropriate to the buildings architectural style are inappropriate l windows should align with others in a block windows lintels and their trim elements should align with those on adjacent older buildings architectural embellishment a preserve the character of the cornice line most historic commercial buildings have cornices to cap their facades their repetition along the street contributes to the visual continuity on the block b reconstruct a missing cornice when historic evidence is available use historic photographs to determine design details of the original cornice c replacement elements should match the original in every detail especially in overall size and profile d the substitution of another old cornice for the original may be considered provided that the substitute is similar to the original e appropriate materials include stone brick and stamped metal awnings and canopies a an awning or canopy should be similar to those seen traditionally traditionally awnings and canopies were noteworthy features of buildings in downtown and their continued use is preferred b an awning compatible in material and construction to the style of the building is encouraged c canvas awnings are inappropriate in the old town center d use awning colors that are compatible with the overall color scheme of the facade solid colors or simple mutedstripe patterns are appropriate e the awning should fit the opening of the building f simple shed shapes are appropriate for rectangular openings g odd shapes bull nose awnings and bubble awnings are inappropriate on most historic structures h internal illumination of an awning is inappropriate lights may be concealed in the underside of a canopy however i a fixed metal canopy may be considered j appropriate supporting mechanisms are wallmounted brackets chains and posts k mount an awning or canopy to accentuate characterdefining features it should be mounted to highlight moldings that may be found above the storefront and should not hide characterdefining features such as transom windows its mounting should not damage significant features and traditional details 5 to design a project that reinforces the retail oriented function of the street and enhances its pedestrian character a maintain the distinction between the street level and the upper floor b the first floor of the primary facade should be predominantly transparent glass c upper floors should be perceived as being more opaque than the lower floor d highly reflective or darkly tinted glass is inappropriate e express the traditional distinction in floor heights between street level and upper levels materials and fenestration the presence of a belt course is an important feature in this relationship example 6 to promote friendly walkable streets ie projects that support pedestrian activity and contribute to the quality of life are encouraged 7 to provide site amenities such as benches lights waste receptacles landscaping etc to enhance the pedestrian experience  6203 old town design district commercial multifamily residential and mixed use a goal statement the commercial component of old town outside the old town center design district should develop in a manner that is inviting to pedestrians while also accommodating automobiles and architecturally complementary to the old town center development should include a mix of building types including older structures and compatible newer ones each should reflect the design trends of its own time while also contributing to a sense of visual continuity and strengthening the pedestrian experience in addition a combination of uses within a single structure or development is encouraged including residential office and retail b key principles 1 building setbacks a wide variety of building setbacks can be seen throughout the old town design district much of this variety is due to the influence of the automobile and need to provide onsite parking and development in a postzoning ordinance era this parking typically has been provided in front of the building for consumer convenience however this trend has caused an erosion of the edge of buildings located along a sidewalk like that seen historically therefore it is strongly encouraged that new developments should build on this original tradition of building placement and locate parking in the side and rear when feasible that being stated it is a vital interest to the city to preserve the mature tree canopy within the area as much as possible and locate buildings in a manner that preserves the natural character of the area 2 mass and scale a variety of building sizes exist in this area while contemporary design approaches are encouraged developments should continue to exhibit a variety in sizes similar to the buildings seen traditionally 3 building materials building materials of structures should contribute to the visual continuity of the area they should appear similar to those seen traditionally to establish a sense of visual continuity 4 architectural character the old town center is made up of architectural styles from the early 1900s the city wishes to build upon these architectural styles by expanding their use outside the old town center commercial office medical retail and industrial buildings throughout the old town design district should build upon these styles utilizing their architectural features and details on new structures they should also relate to one another consistent use of similar building materials storefronts recessed entries and the alignment of these different elements along a block this tradition is strongly encouraged for new developments in the district the neighborhoods of the design district represent a number of different architectural styles and reflect the time periods in which they were constructed commercial construction within the district may utilize residential architectural design thus blending the uses and the visual harmony of differing construction eras 5 pedestrian environment the design district should provide a controlled organized automobile system that provides a safe pedestrian environment development should include direct well marked linkages from the sidewalk to a well defined front door entry streets sidewalks and landscaping should define the road edge and encourage walking sitting and other pedestrian activities projects that occur in the area will also have automobile activity associated with them this should not however make it an unsafe environment for the pedestrian automobile circulation patterns both internal and external should be clearly identified and should not interfere with pedestrian circulation systems c design elements this section presents design guidelines for individual building elements that are influential to the overall character of buildings in old town when the elements are appropriately use in combination with oneanother buildings will reflect an appropriate look and feel that is consistent with the goals of the old town design district within each element are individual goals and design guidelines statements upon which the city will base its decisions as to the appropriateness of any new or remodeled structure 1 the architectural style of all new and rehabilitated buildings in the old town design district should be designed to reflect either traditional old town center commercial buildings or be consistent and compatible with that of the traditional residential styles of the area buildings that are designed to reflect a traditional commercial style of old town should utilize an architectural style that gives the appearance of belonging in old town while it is important that buildings be compatible with the surrounding traditional commercial context it is not necessary that they exactly imitate older building styles buildings that are designed to reflect a traditional residential style should incorporate an individual style and not blend various styles found in the area the property owner is encouraged to use the one of the styles listed below or an appropriate variation in designing the overall character of their building a new

victorian decorative detailing on simple folk house forms and are typically much less elaborate than the victorian styles that they mimicked the primary areas for the detailing are the porch and cornice line there are a number of subtypes but the most common one in old town is the asymmetrical gable front with wing and covered porch porch supports are commonly either turned spindles or square posts with beveled corners characteristics a simple folk house form b gable front with wing c single story with covered porch d spindle work porch detailing prairie style residentialcirca 19001920 this style is sometimes referred to as the prairie box or american foursquare it has a simple square or rectangular plan low pitched hipped roof and symmetrical facade one story wings porches or

center design district buildings should align closer to the street than a typical singlefamily detached structure providing resident parking in the rear to enhance the pedestrian nature of the area and to showcase the architectural features of the structure 2 the use of traditional building materials found in the area should be continued brick and stoneused for building walls chimneys porch supports and foundationswere the primary materials used wood siding also occurred on residentialtype structures with painted horizontal clapboard being the most popular in each case the distinct characteristics of the building material including the scale of the material unit its texture and finish contribute to the historic character of a building the best way to preserve or rehabilitate older building materials is planned maintenance wood surfaces for example should be protected with a good application of paint in some cases historic building materials may be deteriorated when deterioration occurs repairing the material rather than replacing it is preferred frequently damaged materials can be patched or consolidated using special bonding agents in other situations however some portion of the material may be beyond repair and may be replaced the new material should match the original in appearance rather than replace original materials some property owners may consider covering them aluminum and vinyl siding are examples of materials that are often discussed and are not allowed a materials shall appear to be similar to those used traditionally b brick and cast stone were the traditional materials of commercial style buildings c brick cast stone and horizontal lap siding were the traditional materials of residential style buildings when horizontal siding is required a modern material such as hardiplank may be used to achieve the desired look while providing a material that is more durable and requires less maintenance d a simple material finish is encouraged for a large expanse of wall plane e a matte or nonreflective finish is preferred f polished stone should be avoided as a primary material the appropriate use of color can be used to embellish building facade elements and enhance the attractive details of commercial buildings and should not disguise or overpower them colors should compliment neighboring buildings and reflect a traditional color palette extremely bright fluorescent or neon colors shall not be permitted as the primary color on the facades of buildings in the old town design district only colors similar to or comparable to the palette adopted by the national trust for historic preservation will be allowed 3 maintain the traditional mass size and form of buildings seen within the area a buildings mass and size is its exterior bulk and form is its shape in its relationship to its adjoining buildings and to its userspedestrians a building heights vary in the old town and yet there is a strong sense of similarity in scale b building wall offsets including projections recesses changes in floor level or changes of materials should be used to add architectural variety and interest and to relieve the visual impact of a blank wall c while single buildings may span several of the 20 to 30foot wide properties the individual lot width is still expressed as a distinct bay or module buildings should reflect this pattern d traditional floor heights should be expressed with horizontal moldings alignment of windows and other architectural details e floortofloor heights shall appear to be similar to those seen traditionally in particular the windows in a building should appear similar in height to those seen traditionally windowsills moldings and cornices are among those elements that may be seen to align roofs the character of the roof is a major feature for most historic structures when repeated along the street the repetition of similar roof forms contributes to a sense of visual continuity for the neighborhood in each case the roof pitch its materials size and orientation are all distinct features that contribute to the character of a roof gabled and hip forms occur most frequently in residential areas while flat roofs appear on older commercial buildings in the city although the function of a roof is to protect a structure from the elements it also contributes to the overall character of the building the old town design district has seen the construction of various roof forms as illustrated below roof forms porches many residential styles and building types developed with the porch as a prime feature of the front facade because of their historical importance and prominence as characterdefining features porches should be preserved and they should receive sensitive treatment during exterior rehabilitation porches vary as much as architectural styles they differ in height scale location materials and articulation some are simple onestory structures while others may be complex with elaborate details and finishes these elements often correspond to the architectural style of the house and therefore the buildings design character should be considered before any major rehabilitation work is begun a maintain the existing location shape details and columns of the porch b missing or deteriorated decorative elements should be replaced with new wood milled to match existing elements match the original proportions and spacing of balusters when replacing missing ones c unless used historically wrought iron porch posts and columns are inappropriate d enclosing a porch with opaque materials that destroy the openness and transparency of the porch is inappropriate when a porch is enclosed or screened it shall be done with a clear transparent material this material should be placed behind porch columns 4 include architectural elements similar to those seen traditionally ie recessed entries display windows kickplates transom windows cornices vertically oriented upperstory windows awnings for nonresidential styled buildings individual building architectural elements play a critical role in the overall appearance the following design elements are intended for use on that type structure and not on buildings that are designed to model a residential style architectural elements are the individual components of a building including walls doors windows cornices parapets roofs pediments and other features ornamentation and details of elements such as cornices and parapets are original components that dress up a building and give it a sense of style and character ornamental items include hoodmolds trim at doors and windows  plaques and medallions  signboards or sign panels  date or name stones  and simple geometric shapes in metal stone or concrete for a commercial storefront building a rehabilitation or new project should preserve or include as many as possible these defining elements cornices which are usually found at the top of building walls and ornamental moldings or belt courses which are located just above storefronts are horizontal projecting elements that provide a visual break in or termination to a wall a parapet is an upward extension of a building wall above the roofline sometimes ornamental capped with brick stone or tile and frequently decorative elements or panels are placed in it and sometimes plain used to give a building a greater feeling of height or a better sense of proportion commercial buildings should for the most part all relate to the street and to pedestrians in the same manner with a clearly defined primary entrance and large display windows the repetition of these standard elements creates a visual unity on the street that should be preserved a display windows the main portion of glass on the storefront where goods and services are displayed this will help maintain the interest of the street to pedestrians by providing views to goods and activities inside first floor windows b transom the upper portion of the display window separated by a frame c kickplate found beneath the display window sometimes called a bulkhead panel d entry usually set back from the sidewalk in a protected recess e upperstory windows windows located above the street level these usually have a vertical orientation f cornice molding a decorative band at the top of the building architectural elements storefronts a while commercial structures in the old town design district may be setback from the street edge is important to provide a storefront that defines the main entry from the street for both the pedestrian and the automobile b alternative designs that are contemporary interpretations of traditional storefronts may be considered c where the original is missing and no evidence of its character exists a new design that uses the traditional elements may be considered however the new design should continue to convey the character of typical storefronts including the transparent character of the display window d significantly increasing or decreasing the amount of glass will negatively affect the integrity of a structure e on traditional storefronts first floors should be more transparent than upper floors upper floors should appear more solid than first floors f avoid a blank wall appearance that does not provide interest to pedestrians g large surfaces of glass are inappropriate on the upper floors and sides of commercial buildings if necessary divide large glass surfaces into smaller windows that are in scale with those seen traditionally entrances a maintain recessed entries where they are found b the repetition of recessed entries provides a rhythm of shadows along the street which helps establish a sense of scale c these recessed entries were designed to provide protection from the weather and the repeated rhythm of these shaded areas along the street helps to identify business entrances typically recessed entries were set back between three and five feet d restore the historic recessed entry if it has been altered e where entries were not recessed historically maintain them in their original position however one may also need to comply with other code requirements including door width direction of swing and construction in some cases entries must comply with accessibility requirements of the americans with disabilities act note however that some flexibility in application of these other regulations is provided for historic properties f clearly define the primary entrance with an awning canopy or other architectural or landscape feature g secondary public entrances are also encouraged on a larger building or along an alley if there is parking in the rear of the site windows and doors windows and doors are some of the most important characterdefining features of older structures they give scale to buildings and provide visual interest to the composition of individual facades distinct window and door designs in fact help define many building styles windows and doors often are inset into relatively deep openings or they have surrounding casings and sash components that have a substantial dimension that cast shadows which also contributes to the character of the historic style a typical upperstory window is twice as tall as it is wide these proportions are within a limited range  therefore upperstory windows in new construction should relate to the window proportions seen traditionally features important to the character of a window include its clear glass frame sash muntins mullions glazing sills heads jambs moldings operation location and relation to other windows features important to the character of a door include the door itself doorframe screen door threshold glass panes paneling hardware detailing transoms and flanking sidelights a retain the original shape of the transom glass in historic storefronts transoms the upper glass band of traditional storefronts introduced light into the depths of the building saving on light costs these bands should not be removed or enclosed b the shape of the transom is important to the proportion of the storefront and it should be preserved in its historic configuration c if the original glass is missing installing new glass is preferred d preserve the position number size and arrangement of historic windows and doors in a building wall many windows are oneoverone in that a single pane of glass is in both the upper and lower sashes others are twooverone with two panes or lights in the upper sash and one is in the lower sash these arrangements are preferred e enclosing an historic opening in a key characterdefining facade is inappropriate as is adding a new opening f do not close down an original opening to accommodate a smaller window restoring original openings which have been altered over time is encouraged g traditionally windows had a vertical emphasis the proportions of these windows contribute to the character of each residence and commercial storefront h if it is broken or has been removed in the past consider replacing it with new glass if security is a concern consider using wire glass tempered glass or light metal security bars preferably on the interior i installing window airconditioners in windows on building fronts is inappropriate j a new or replacement window or door should match the appearance of the original while replacing an entire window or door is discouraged it may be necessary in some cases although wood is preferred as a replacement material metal is common on the market today and sometimes is suggested for replacement it is possible to consider alternative materials if the resulting appearance matches the original as closely as possible the substitute also should have a demonstrated durability in this climate k very ornate windows or doors that are not appropriate to the buildings architectural style are inappropriate l windows should align with others in a block windows lintels and their trim elements should align with those on adjacent older buildings illustration architectural embellishment a preserve the character of the cornice line most historic commercial buildings have cornices to cap their facades their repetition along the street contributes to the visual continuity on the block b reconstruct a missing cornice when historic evidence is available use historic photographs to determine design details of the original cornice c replacement elements should match the original in every detail especially in overall size and profile d the substitution of another old cornice for the original may be considered provided that the substitute is similar to the original e appropriate materials include stone brick and stamped metal awnings and canopies a an awning or canopy should be similar to those seen traditionally traditionally awnings and canopies were noteworthy features of buildings in downtown and their continued use is preferred b an awning compatible in material and construction to the style of the building is encouraged c canvas awnings are inappropriate in the old town center d use awning colors that are compatible with the overall color scheme of the facade solid colors or simple mutedstripe patterns are appropriate e the awning should fit the opening of the building f simple shed shapes are appropriate for rectangular openings g odd shapes bull nose awnings and bubble awnings are inappropriate on most historic structures h internal illumination of an awning is inappropriate lights may be concealed in the underside of a canopy however i a fixed metal canopy may be considered j appropriate supporting mechanisms are wallmounted brackets chains and posts k mount an awning or canopy to accentuate characterdefining features it should be mounted to highlight moldings that may be found above the storefront and should not hide characterdefining features such as transom windows its mounting should not damage significant features and traditional details 5 to promote friendly walkable streets ie projects that support pedestrian activity and contribute to the quality of life are encouraged the old town area should continue to develop as a pedestrianoriented environment streets and sidewalks should encourage walking sitting and other outdoor activities buildings also should be visually interesting to invite exploration by pedestrians existing pedestrian routes should be enhanced these are important concepts because pedestrians experience buildings at close proximity develop the ground floor level of a project to encourage pedestrian activity a sidewalks are required from the front street sidewalk to the front door of the building which should provide the main entrance secondary entrances can be in the rear or side of the building to allow for ease of access from side or rear parking areas b avoid a blank wall or vacant lot appearance c a building should have a clearly defined primary entrance oriented toward the street d clearly identify the road edge and project entrances for both automobiles and pedestrians this can be accomplished by landscape features brick entry pillars sidewalk paver bands at the sidewalk or driveway edge e use landscaping and lighting accents to identify entrances f place parking areas to the rear of a site when feasible or disburse throughout the site  6203 old town design district singlefamily residential use a goal statement the residential component of the old town design district should develop in a manner that is inviting to pedestrians while retaining the feel of older neighborhoods development should include a mix of building types including older structures and newer structures constructed in an architectural style that contributes to a sense of visual continuity and strengthening the residential experience where appropriate a combination of uses is encouraged including singlefamily townhouses and multifamily b key principles 1 building setbacks a wide variety of building setbacks can be seen throughout the old town design district  much of this variety is due to the influence of the automobile and need to provide onsite parking and development in a postzoning ordinance era this parking typically has been provided in front of the building for consumer convenience however this trend has caused an erosion of the edge of buildings located along a sidewalk like that seen historically therefore it is strongly encouraged that new developments should build on this original tradition of building placement and locate parking in the side and rear when feasible that being stated it is a vital interest to the city to preserve the mature tree canopy within the area as much as possible and locate buildings in a manner that preserves the natural character of the area 2 building materials building materials of structures should contribute to the visual continuity of the area they should appear similar to those seen traditionally to establish a sense of visual continuity 3 architectural character the old town center is made up of architectural styles from the early 1900s the neighborhoods of the design district represent a number of different architectural styles and reflect the time periods in which they were constructed 4 pedestrian environment the design district should provide a controlled organized automobile system that provides a safe pedestrian environment development should include direct well marked linkages from the sidewalk to a well defined front door entry streets sidewalks and landscaping should define the road edge and encourage walking sitting and other pedestrian activities c design elements this section presents design guidelines for individual building elements that are influential to the overall character of old town residential buildings when the elements are appropriately used in combination with oneanother buildings will reflect an appropriate look and feel that is consistent with old town within each element are individual goals and design guidelines statements upon which the city will base its decisions as to the appropriateness of any new or remodeled structure 1 the architectural style of all new and rehabilitated residential buildings in the old town design district should be designed to be consistent and compatible with that of the traditional residential styles of the area buildings that are designed to reflect a traditional style of old town should utilize an architectural style that gives the appearance of belonging in old town while it is important that buildings be compatible with the surrounding structures it is not necessary that they exactly imitate older building styles buildings that are designed to reflect a traditional residential style should incorporate an individual style and not blend various styles found in the area the property owner is encouraged to use the one of the styles listed below or an appropriate variation in designing the overall character of their building a new interpretations of traditional building styles are encouraged b a new design that draws upon the fundamental similarities among older buildings in the area without copying them is preferred this will allow the building to be seen as a product of its own time and yet be compatible with its historic neighbors c buildings that are similar in scale and overall character to those seen historically are strongly encouraged d infill should be a balance of new and old in design e this applies to architectural details as well as the overall design of a building queen anne victorian style residentialcirca 18801910 decorative detailing is one of the main characteristics of this architectural style houses typically have irregular shaped hipped roofs often with steep pitches typically the buildings are asymmetrical in shape with one dominant frontfacing gable extensive detailing is utilized to avoid a smoothwall appearance detailing can take multiple forms such as patterned shingles  gingerbread type spindlework  and cutaway bay windows and towers porches are

use of spindlework on porches and friezes folk victorian style residentialcirca 18701910 this style is defined by the presence of victorian decorative detailing on simple folk house forms and are typically much less elaborate than the victorian styles that they mimicked the primary areas for the detailing are the porch and cornice line there are a number of subtypes but the most common one in old town is the asymmetrical gable front with wing and covered porch porch supports are commonly either turned spindles or square posts with beveled corners characteristics a simple folk house form b gable front with wing c single story with covered porch d spindle work porch detailing prairie style residentialcirca 19001920 this style is sometimes referred to as the prairie box or american foursquare it has a simple square or rectangular plan low pitched hipped roof and symmetrical facade one story wings porches or carports are common and subordinate to the principal two story mass the entrance is often a conspicuous focal point of the facade hipped dormers are common as are fullwidth front porches characteristic horizontal decorative elements often consist of contrasting caps on

should utilize an architectural design that is compatible or a similar variation of a residential design listed above other designs are appropriate when key elements are taken into consideration such as porches windows doors roofs materials and overall design and each unit is designed in a manner that fits with the overall old town look and feel that is desired by the city when multiple units are attached it is important that each unit stands apart by using individual porches variations in exterior facade materials or colors minor changes in front setbacks to create a human scale to the grouping of units and not a sense of one large building 2 the use of traditional building materials found in the area should be continued brick and stoneused for building walls chimneys porch supports

perceived line and orientation of the roof as seen from the street c retain and repair roof detailing d often repairing a basically sound roof can be much less expensive than a complete replacement if a new roof is necessary try to match the color material and pattern of the old as closely as possible e water from downspouts should drain away from the building properly f if this is not possible a downspout should empty onto a metal or concrete splash block that slopes downward and away from the building roof types porches many residential styles and building types developed with the porch as a prime feature of the front facade a porch protects an entrance from rain and provides shade in the summer it also provides a sense of scale to the building and provides a space for residents to sit and congregate a porch provides stylistic details to the house and in some cases is an integral part of an architectural style because of their historical importance and prominence as characterdefining features porches should be preserved and they should receive sensitive treatment during exterior rehabilitation porches vary as much as architectural styles they differ in height scale location materials and articulation some are simple onestory structures while others may be complex with elaborate details and finishes these elements often correspond to the architectural style

design that residents and pedestrians can enjoy 5 to minimize the visual impacts of automobiles 6 to strengthen the pedestrian network of sidewalks and paths  6203 institutional design in the districts the design guidelines focus on principles for rehabilitation and infill of commercial and mixeduse projects that should reinforce the existing building fabric and enhance the pedestrian environment in general to do so they draw upon principles established in traditional commercial buildings while these are the majority of property types that will occur in the area institutional facilities should be a part of the urban mix as well these institutional facilities include churches schools libraries courts and governmental offices traditionally buildings for these uses have contrasted with the framework of storefronts an example is an historic courthouse it stands apart from the rows of commercial buildings framed by a lawn as a foreground its entrances are more prominent while it stands apart as a structure however it clearly is a part of the downtown with its entrances oriented to the street and walkways promoting pedestrian use this helps to convey its civic function as a gathering place at the same time the basic principles of urban design outlined in this document should still apply among them are these key principles 1 institutional facilities should be located such that they encourage pedestrian traffic to nearby downtown businesses 2 institutional facilities should be designed to reinforce the downtown fabric of streets and sidewalks 3 convenient pedestrian connections should link abutting institutional buildings 4 the edges of a institutional property should be inviting to pedestrians 5 the visual impacts of automobiles should be minimized 6 primary entrances should face the street not to parking lots 7 a sense of human scale should be conveyed 8 impacts on adjacent historic resources should be minimized 9 outdoor spaces designed for public use should be provided  6203 design guidelines for additions and alterations a goal statement the old town design district and old town center design district both contain a significant number of structures that are important to the original fabric of the community special consideration should be given to preserve these buildings and utilize them whenever possible utilization of these buildings often requires additions and alterations to adapt a residential structure into a commercial building or a commercial building into a residential use and should be done carefully so not to visually impact the significant nature of the original building b key principles 1 design of alterations alterations may be considered for historic buildings  however alterations should occur in a manner that will not diminish the historic integrity of the property and they should be reversible for future property owners 2 additions many buildings have experienced additions over time as need for additional space occurred particularly with a change in use an historic addition typically was subordinate in scale and character to the main building the height of the addition was usually positioned below that of the main structure and it was often located to the side or rear such that the primary facade remained dominate an addition was often constructed of materials that were similar to those in use historically in some cases owners simply added on to an existing roof creating more usable space without increasing the footprint of the structure this tradition of adding on to buildings is anticipated to continue it is important however that new additions be designed in such a manner that they maintain the character of the primary structure 3 adaptive use the adaptive use of a residence for a commercial or office use is a distinct possibility in old town however when such adaptations must occur they should be designed to have the least impact on the historic character of a neighborhoodsome of which is residential in character although for commercial use these adapted properties should not be commercial in character this means that the overall form of a building with a sloping roof and the landscaped front lawn should not be altered c design elements this section presents design guidelines for alterations and additions to existing buildings and should be considered in conjunction with design elements found elsewhere in this section pertaining to individual building elements that are influential to the overall character of old town when the elements are appropriately used in combination with oneanother buildings will reflect an appropriate look and feel that is consistent with old town within each element are individual goals and design guidelines statements upon which the city will base its decisions as to the appropriateness of any new or remodeled structure 1 design an alteration to be compatible with the original character of the property a avoid alterations that would damage historic features b avoid alterations that would hinder the ability to interpret the design character of the original building c alterations that seek to imply an earlier period than that of the building are inappropriate for example mounting a sign panel in a manner that causes decorative moldings to be chipped or removed would be inappropriate 2 minimize the visual impacts of an addition to a commercial building two distinct types of additions are considered to be appropriate ground level or rooftop first a groundlevel addition that involves expanding the footprint of a structure may be considered such an addition should be to the rear or side of a building this will have the least impact on the character of a building but there may only be limited opportunities to do this a an addition shall be compatible in scale materials and character with the main building b an addition shall relate to the building in mass scale and form it should be designed to remain subordinate to the main structure c an addition to the front of a building is inappropriate however where a building is set back from the front property line the first consideration for the placement of an addition should be to fill the gap between the existing building and sidewalk this will maintain the consistent street wall desired in the old town center design district d an addition shall not damage or obscure architecturally important features for example loss or alteration of a cornice line should be avoided addition to commercial building second an addition to the roof may be designed that is simple in character and set back substantially from the front of a building in addition the materials window sizes and alignment of trim elements on the addition should be compatible to those of the existing structure an addition may be made to the roof of a commercial building if it does the following a an addition should be set back from the primary characterdefining facade to preserve the perception of the historic scale of the building b its design should be modest in character so it will not attract attention from the historic facade c the addition should be distinguishable as new albeit in a subtle way another option which will only be considered on a casebycase basis is to design an addition to the front wall plane of the existing building this option may only be considered on a newer or more contemporary building that was originally constructed set back from the front property line or sidewalk edge 3 design an addition to a residential structure to be compatible with the primary building an addition to a structure can radically change its perceived scale and character if inappropriately designed when planning an addition consider the effect the addition will have on the building itself when creating an addition keep the size of the addition small in relation to the main structure if an addition must be larger it should set apart from the main structure and connected with a smaller linking element a design for a new addition that would create an appearance inconsistent with the character of the building especially an historic one is discouraged illustration one also should consider the effect the addition may have on the character of a street or neighborhood as seen from the public rightofway for example a side addition may change the sense of rhythm established by side yards in the block locating the addition to the rear could be a better solution in such a case a design a new addition such that the original character can be clearly seen in this way a viewer can understand the history of changes that have occurred to the building an addition shall be compatible in scale materials and character with the main building b an addition should be made distinguishable from the original building even in subtle ways such that the character of the original can be interpreted c creating a jog in the foundation between the original and new structures may help to define an addition d even applying a new trim board at the connection point between the addition and the original structure can help define the addition e place an addition at the rear of a building or set it back from the front to minimize the visual impacts f locating an addition at the front of a structure is inappropriate g do not obscure damage destroy or remove original architectural details and materials of the primary structure h an addition shall relate to the historic building in mass scale and form it should be designed to remain subordinate to the main structure i while a smaller addition is visually preferable if a residential addition would be significantly larger than the original building one option is to separate it from the primary building when feasible and then link it with a smaller connecting structure j an addition should be simple in design to prevent it from competing with the primary facade k consider adding dormers to create second story spaces before changing the scale of the building by adding a full second floor l the roof form of a new addition shall be in character with that of the primary building m typically gable hip and shed roofs are appropriate for residential additions flat roofs are appropriate for commercial buildings n repeat existing roof slopes and materials o if the roof of the primary building is symmetrically proportioned the roof of the addition should be similar 4 when adapting a residence to a commercial use respect the residential character of the building seek uses that are compatible with the historic character of the building the openness of a front yard should be preserved for example converting a building to a new use that is different from that which its design reflects is considered to be adaptive use when residential use ceases to be viable the first preference is to choose new uses that minimize the negative changes in building features often there are new uses that are inherently less disruptive to residential structures such as a bed and breakfast professional offices small specialty restaurants and personal service businesses a seek uses that are compatible with the historic character of the building b the primary goal should be preserving the original residential character appearance and scale of the structure c avoid altering porches and original windows and doors  6203 reserved editors note  adopted  repealed  95198 which pertained to signage in old town and derived from  6203 appendix 1  old town center

guidelines for the design of new and renovated signs in lewisvilles old town district organized into a series of relevant design topics these guiding principles help to frame the prescriptive requirements of the old town sign each category individual policies and design guidelines are presented which the old town design review committee may reference in determining the appropriateness of the work proposed b overview signs are an integral part of the built environment and if designed well can provide direction encourage business growth and enhance an areas image if designed poorly they can confuse viewers stifle business and detract from the appearance and perception of the public realm c purpose a sign typically serves two functions to attract attention and to convey information essentially identifying the business or services offered within a building architectural elements of a building window displays outdoor seating and other streetscape elements can also work to supplement signage for example the building front alone can serve as an attentiongetting function allowing the sign to be focused on conveying information d core principles in the determination of appropriate sign design the following principles should be observed 1 signs are subordinate to the building architecture 2 signs are part of a larger streetscape 3 signs are intended for different speeds of traffic consider the building front as part of an overall sign program signs should be coordinated within the overall facade composition so that it is in proportion to the building and does not dominate the appearance additionally a master sign plan for the entire building should be developed to guide design decisions for individual signs this is especially important where the use of contemporary building forms and styles in conjunction with several colorful attentiongetting signs are the norm typical stripcommercial development patterns are inappropriate in old town a sign should appear to be in scale with the facade locate signage on a building so that it emphasizes design elements of the facade mount signs to fit within existing architectural features and use the shape of the sign to reinforce the horizontal lines of moldings and transoms seen from the street the placement or location of a sign is perhaps the most critical factor in maintaining the order and integrity of old town consistent placement of signs according to building type size location and even materials creates a visual pattern that its audience can easily interpret and utilize to the mutual benefit of merchants tourists and customers e design elements 1 color the color palette for signs should be drawn from those approved by the national trust for historic preservation colors should relate to each other as well as their surroundings for example a very light or white background on a sign may be too stark for its context and compete with the architectural elements of the building also limit the number of colors used on a sign in general no more than three to five colors are recommended 2 typeface typical typefaces found in old town are constructed from serifstyle fonts serifstyle fonts tend to be more legible at larger sizes while sansserif fonts are more appropriate for supporting detail text a mixture of fonts and lettering sizes can add interest to a sign provided that no more than two are used avoid hardtoread or overly intricate typeface styles 3 shape signs in old town should have detailed edges for example rectangular signs may have notched or rounded edges and should relate to the architectural character of the building an elliptical sign may be more appropriate as a projecting sign than as a wall sign if the shape of the sign is discordant with the architecture of the building however the same elliptical sign could be used to highlight the rhythm of architectural elements by locating it over a column or centered within a structural bay 4 materials sign materials should be consistent with those listed in the old town sign monument signs should reflect the architectural style of the buildings on the same lot for example a monument sign for a brick building should be made of brick as well plastic is not an allowed material in old town 5 lighting type lighting types should also be consistent with those listed in the sign style lighting fixtures should be considered for projecting or wall signs gooseneck style fixtures are recommended 6 legibility care should be given to the intended audience of a sign and its readability positive contrast or lighter text on a darker background tends to be easier to read negative contrast or darker text on a lighter background can sometimes cause the lettering to develop a fuzzy edge  studies show that seven words are the most a viewer can effectively read  7 variety and creativity variety in sign design should be encouraged most businesses choosing to locate in old town particularly in the old town center are small familyowned enterprises each with their own personalized way of operating this social context offers the community an opportunity to develop signs that are homegrown and unique  quality and craftsmanship should be a part of every sign in old town using a symbol for a sign is encouraged symbols add interest to the street can be read quickly and are remembered better than written words 8 sign quality business signage can be the first impression a potential customer receives and should incorporate the same level of care and quality found inside the business a quality sign typically includes a balance of font styles and sizes colors graphics durable materials and supports the building architecture 9 audience sign design should consider the viewer or end user of the sign larger signs are more appropriate for faster moving traffic such as vehicles where the time the viewer has to identify the sign understand it and react to it is shorter than pedestrian traffic for vehicularoriented signs greater spacing between text and larger lettering is appropriate for pedestrianoriented signs text may be smaller and still achieve legibility 10 sign hierarchy signs should work together in a hierarchical relationship the larger primary signs of a business such as a monument sign or a wall sign would most likely express the main idea of the business including the name and perhaps an iconic graphic representing the industry or character of the place secondary signs such as window and hanging signs strengthen the overall theme offering supporting information for example a cafe may contain the name of the business on the wall sign and then in smaller lettering on the window list items offered eg coffee tea pastries etc in this way the information is organized in the same format it is processed by the viewer first locating the destination then selecting options at that location duplicating information on the same facade does not utilize the allowable sign area to its full potential and is discouraged in old town 11 historic context traditionally a variety of signs existed within the old town district  small freestanding signs mounted on a pole or post  located near the sidewalk because the primary structure or business was set back from the street eg an area with residential character printed on both sides  mediumsized square or rectangularshaped signs that projected from the building above the awnings or canopies printed on both sides  small horizontallyoriented rectangular signs that protruded from the building below the awnings or canopies but above pedestrians heads printed on both sides  medium to large horizontally oriented rectangular signs attached flat against the building above andor below the awnings printed on one side only  window signs painted on glass used at the street level and on upper floors signs that were historically mounted on a buildings exterior advertised the primary business or service typically this use occupied a streetlevel space and sometimes upper floors as well in the case of a large structure that included several businesses on upper floors the name of the building itself was displayed on an exterior sign and tenants relied on a directory placed at the street level signs were designed to fit within architectural features and in many cases were mounted flush above the storefront just over moldings others were located between columns or centered in panels on a building face this method enabled the viewer to see the design and character of individual structures generally signs allowed in old town fall into one of three categories primary secondary and temporary  a primary sign represents the owners largest sign expense and is likely the most important of the sign types only one primary sign is allowed per business per building  secondary signs are utilized in addition to the primary building sign and generally tied to an architectural feature typically a secondary sign is an awning projecting or window sign the secondary sign is generally intended to capture the attention of a pedestrian walking on the sidewalk while the primary signs audience is typically driving past in a vehicle  tertiary signs are also intended for pedestrian view and may consist of hanging sandwich board or restaurant menu cases these signs are allowed for each tenant of a building f design of sign types 1 awning canopy or marquee signs awning and canopy structures should be of a visually uniform style on a building for example it would be inappropriate to have metal canopies canvas awnings and bullnosestyle awnings on the same facade or along two facades sharing a corner however different styles of awning or canopy structures could be located on opposite facades where they cannot be seen at the same time 2 wall signs in many cases turnofthe century building types common in lewisville have a sign band this is the ideal location for the primary building sign the sign band is typically located above the transom and below the secondfloor windows when utilizing the sign band as the sign placement location it is important to respect the borders the sign should not overlap or crowd the top bottom or ends of the sign band when feasible place a wall sign so that it aligns with others on the block 3 window signs and displays while window displays are not reviewed by the otdrc their use is very important to retailers the attractiveness of a display is likely the highest contributing factor to whether or not a pedestrian will enter a store and its design should be carefully planned the otdrc will recognize and assume oversight of signs within a store that are obviously intended to be viewed window use of reflective tinted or coated glass is not appropriate for windows and doors of ground floor commercial buildings in old town additionally window coverings should not be used to obscure transparency 4 hanging signs a small hanging sign may be easier for a pedestrian to read than other sign types and is encouraged hanging signs should be located near the business entrance just above the door or to the side of it a hanging sign should be mounted perpendicular with the building facade 5 projecting signs projecting signs should be larger than hanging signs mounted higher and centered on the facade or positioned at the corner of a building for buildings located at a street intersection a projecting sign not exceeding 30 square feet may be considered at the corner facing the street intersection provided there are no projecting signs on the building facades facing the intersecting streets 6 multitenant wall signs where several businesses share a building the signs should be coordinated if several smaller signs are used they should be located in harmony with the building architecture taking into account bay spacing windows or other elements that establish an architectural rhythm use similar forms or backgrounds for the signs to tie them together visually and make them easier to read consistency among the signs should be balanced with sign originality to maintain legibility and character 7 lowprofilemonument signs lowprofilemonument signs should match the architectural style and material of buildings on the same lot  1exh a 4113 footnotes  2  apa brief contextsensitive signage design 3  allston village design guidelines allston ma  4

eightmile corridor contains unique character areas including water urban and park the following corridor character principles are intended to provide a thematic vision for public infrastructure along the corridor and its subareas this section is organized to present intent statements for spatial elements contained within the corridor followed by design principles for each of the character subareas the principles should be used to provide guidance during the decisionmaking process when evaluating detailed concepts for proposed treatments within the corridor these principles were used in the development of the ih35e corridor identity plan which adopted the three character zone designations and determined the appropriate limits for each within the corridor the physical design elements for the corridor were then developed in terms of the aesthetic character which was then applied to typical interchange locations along the corridor a vocabulary of common elements was established for the entire corridor including lighting banner poles wayfinding plantings cross street gateway identifiers pedestrian protection barriers decorative crosswalk pavement and bridge abutment wall treatments unique character zone defining elements were developed for pedestrian paving patterns custom retaining wall graphics pedestrian protection wall forms and textures and planting palette the corridor experience the eightmile drive along the ih35e corridor provides a range of experiences that can be interpreted in the physical design of the spatial elements throughout the corridor this corridor contains modulation compression of the rightofway in areas where the highway is depressed and openness as the highway crests to expansive views of the region on a smaller scale the corridor passes under bridges which will serve as landmarks and along a variety of walled conditions through the journey the corridor also passes along watercourses and open spaces that are amenities to local neighborhoods these experiences provide inspiration that can inform the design of elements at the scale of the entire corridor and at smaller neighborhood scales unifying character theme one of the most impressive natural resources along this corridor is lake lewisville the lake is a psychological and physical place of respite and recreation and is a regional attraction in the dallas metropolitan area during work sessions with the projects advisory committee the lake was identified as the most recognizable asset to the city and the theme of water was proposed as a unifying theme for the corridor the purpose of providing a unifying theme is to provide a consistent brand for the city and to inform drivers of the range of experiences and opportunities contained in this corridor subarea character themes due to the length of the corridor the range of experiences it offers and the character of its adjacent communities subarea themes are proposed for the north central and south portions of the corridor subarea themes will help to break down scale of the corridor and provide neighborhood identification water should be a defining characteristic in the north section and used as a unifying theme northwater the subarea themes for the north section of the corridor are water and recreation combined with the vacant parcels available for redevelopment along the corridor the water theme could serve as an organizing element for future development lifestyle oriented development could reflect the unique attributes of living working and recreating around water the design elements along this northern reach need to come together to draw visitors off the highway thereby capturing greater market share  gateways and landmarks should be focused at garden ridge boulevard and valley ridge boulevard both primary entrances into the lake area higher density nodal development should be focused around these gateways to draw in visitors  water should be a defining characteristic in the treatment of walls bridges lighting and art species such as sun fish and large mouth bass could be utilized as relief along retaining walls to remind visitors of the lake lewisville recreational amenity the central section of the corridor is tied to old town lewisville centralurban the theme of the central section of the corridor ties to historic old town lewisville though located approximately one mile from the center of old town ih35e currently has little relationship to old town and the medical uses in between design elements should be consistent with the historic architecture of old town  gateways and landmarks need to be located at both south mill street and west main street to signify entrance into the historic heart of the community tying newer land uses along the highway with the history of old town  design treatments for walls bridges lighting building architecture and art should emphasize the areas history brick and warm materials need to reflect the historic nature of old town hebron parkway could benefit from a gateway in the southern section southpark the southern section of the ih35e corridor will remain an important center of retail hospitality and corporate office space the theme for this area should focus on its location as a gateway and destination and capitalize on its unique assets such as timber creek  a gateway is needed at hebron parkway to distinguish this area as a center of activity and connectivity between uses east and west of the highway this bridge could exhibit a unique architectural style such as an arched truss bridge tall lighted elements along this bridge could denote this as a special area and create a nighttime place while preserving views north and south during the day  due to the complexity of the intersection of sh121 to allow for all necessary vehicle movements this area will contain a high percentage of retaining walls special attention will be required to reduce the impact of the walls variety of surface treatments including massing breaks color changes and texture variations additional surface treatments could include the incorporation of public art to display shallow relief images with colored material unifying character theme spatial elements the experience and character of the corridor will be communicated design and treatment of its spatial elements following are design principles for the primary spatial elements that will be experienced throughout the corridor each of the spatial elements described below should be designed to complement the unifying theme and respective subarea themes along the ih35e corridor each spatial element is defined below intent statements describe how each element is characterized in the corridor principles are included that should be incorporated in the design of each element a landmarks and gateways take the form of natural features and design elements and include bridges intersection treatments development form and significant open space areas intents  landmarks identify and brand the city of lewisville and its neighborhoods  landmarks form a mental map for wayfinding purposes and can be created or manmade means  gateways identify particular areas within the city or particular neighborhoods landmarks can enhance wayfinding gateways should be at least 8 feet tall principles a1 to achieve a consistent treatment where gateways are provided gateways should be designed as elements that either span across a highway or path or are symmetrical treatments located on each side of the highway rightofway or path and require users to either pass under or pass to promote the diversity that exists in lewisville landmark locations are identified within the primary catalysts of subareas 2 5 and 7 a3 to diversify community image landmark and gateway treatments should contain a minimum of three 3 exterior materials a4 to promote visual clarity gateway treatments should be a minimum of eightfeet 8 tall at any dimension from the ground or base condition a5 to incorporate nodal development landmarks and gateway treatments should be integrated with intersection design at identified nodes b development patterns describe how buildings roads and open space are organized together in a particular area these patterns contribute significantly to the character of the highway intents  development is composed of compact centers or nodes of mixed use development  environments are designed to be comfortable to pedestrians and bicyclists  networks of transportation modes interconnect development and open space  land use and transportation are intricately linked to create active engaging places lowdensity development top and node development bottom principles b1 to reduce sprawl create development nodes that capture a higher number of vehicle trips accessing the corridor than traditional development b2 to promote active places create centers of mixeduse developments near a variety of residential densities b3 to promote active places site design for major projects should allow for increased densities over time b4 to reduce the occurrence of strip development new development should be nodal in character and concentrate development along the highway at planned areas that are separated by open space b5 to leverage transportation access the tallest and densest development patterns should occur within 700 feet to onequarter mile radius of planned nodes most nodes are situated at interchanges b6 to improve development character parking locations should be less prominent and located to the rear of buildings or in parking structures b7 to promote active streets pedestrianoriented uses should be located on ground floors of buildings b8 to facilitate more active places sidewalks should be wider in planned development nodes than in other lower density areas b9 to provide amenities for pedestrians sidewalks should incorporate street trees benches kiosks and plazas lowdensity development top and node development bottom b10 to promote active streets autooriented uses including service stations and drive should be discouraged within onequarter mile radius of planned nodes b11 to provide a pedestrianfriendly street network street block sizes should not exceed 600000 square feet c rightofway treatments include bridges walls fencing landscaping and lighting intents  rightofway treatments embody the unifying and subarea themes described in this plan  aesthetic treatments are visibly consistent for public and private lands when viewed from the corridor principles c1 to improve aesthetic quality bridges should contain a minimum of three 3 exterior materials and include accent lighting in addition to standard lighting for safety c2 to improve aesthetic quality no chain link fencing is allowed within direct view of the corridor or fiftyfeet 50 outside the state owned rightofway a bridge integrating a gateway treatment and architectural pedestrian railing patterns can break down the scale of walls c3 to improve the aesthetic quality fencing treatments should incorporate live droughttolerant vegetation where direct transparency for safety is not required c4 to improve the aesthetic quality landscape treatments including flowering plants should be provided adjacent to identified gateways and landmark areas c5 to reduce a canyon effect in the corridor vertical surfaces of walls should not exceed twenty feet 20 without a twelve inch 12 minimum horizontal break c6 to break down the scale of walls patterns should be created that are a maximum of four feet 4 in any direction c7 to promote a pedestrianoriented environment pedestrian routes should be buffered from fastmoving traffic and expanses of parking d natural spaces along the highway are primarily passive in form and include open space pedestrian pathways waterways wetlands and stormwater drainage areas intents  natural spaces complement and separate areas of nodal development and enhance the natural surroundings  natural spaces represent interconnected systems and are organized to facilitate systemwide drainage  view corridors provide expansive views out of the corridor and identify landmarks when appropriate principles d1 to facilitate pedestrian connectivity natural spaces should create linear systems particularly eastwest along the corridor d2 to maintain a sustainable landscape only native plantings should be provided d3 to promote expansive views low plantings should be provided in open spaces designated to frame long views d4 to improve water quality native landscape materials should be utilized to provide primary filtration of stormwater prior to entering sewers low plantings preserve expansive views native plantings maintain a sustainable landscape e access locations include the locations of curb cuts and intersections on frontage roads arterial streets and intersections within the corridor intents  frontage roads facilitate local circulation parallel to the highway and provide access to the local street system  local streets provide the majority of access to private property along the corridor principles e1 to promote access street patterns should form an interconnected grid that simplifies access for all transportation modes e2 to improve multimodal circulation bridges should include pedestrian paths and bicycle lanes e3 to increase capacity of the frontage road system curb cuts should be minimized retaining walls with unique character and treatments f nighttime treatments include the organization and design of safety lighting and accent lighting on spatial elements including landmarks key building and landscape treatments bridge and wall treatments and open spaces intents  corridor treatments should be designed for daytime and nighttime users  effect lighting attempts to replicate the daytime experience for nighttime users  lighting for safety is integrated with effect lighting and provides a consistent design theme principles f1 to improve the aesthetic quality accent lighting should be included in rightofway treatments f2 to express the design theme in each subarea safety lighting should be incorporated with effect lighting f3 to promote walking during nighttime pedestrian scaled lighting should be included on all walkways with onequarter mile of defined nodes pedestrian scale lighting promotes walking g street design includes both traffic and pedestrian zones intents  the traffic zone encompasses vehicular and bicycle movements and can also include medians crosswalks and onstreet parking  the pedestrian zone includes all elements from the back of curb principles traffic zone g1 vehicular lane width will vary based on the street type and traffic volume on highways such as ih35e 12foot lanes may be most appropriate arterials with heavier volumes of traffic may require 11 to 12 foot lanes on local streets 10 to 11 foot lanes are encouraged to help reduce speed and narrow the overall traffic zone width g2 bicycles may be accommodated either wider outside lane or striped bicycle lane bicycle lane widths should be between four and six feet when placed adjacent to onstreet parking an additional 1 to 2 feet of bicycle lane should be provided g3 medians should provide refuge areas for pedestrians and include special planting paving treatments or public art installations at each end to create a visual amenity traffic zones need to balance vehicular and bicycle modes g4 crosswalks should include inset materials or textures including brick pavers or stamped concrete which provides visual amenity and functional traffic calming for intersections g5 onstreet parking is typically 8 to 10 feet wide allowing for parallel parking adjacent to the vehicular lane onstreet parking is typically placed on corridors with lower speed limits and streets with active pedestrian and development to help calm traffic and serve surrounding land uses principles pedestrian zone g6 sidewalks on frontage roads and arterial streets are encouraged to be detached from the curb and setback from the street a minimum of eight feet 8 sidewalk widths should be a minimum of six feet 6 and can exceed twelve feet 12 depending on planned pedestrian activity sidewalks on local streets should be a minimum of six feet 6 and either be attached or detached depending on other amenities provided g7 curb cuts should be subject to conditions specified by an access management strategy for arterial roads curb cuts are only encouraged at combined business entries and for parcels that cannot be accessed from a local road curb cuts on all streets should be designed to be as narrow as possible while providing for safe traffic movements and access benches and sidewalk treatments contribute to street character g8 street trees are encouraged within the amenity zone the trunk should be setback from the street a minimum of three feet 3 to provide a clear area from the street and to allow the canopy to mature g9 planter boxes can be located in the amenity area and provide a buffer along busy streets and create a more intimate pedestrian space planters can be seasonal or permanent g10 lighting along sidewalks should be provided to indicate safe pedestrian pathways pedestrian scale lighting can be incorporated with traffic lighting poles or provided as independent elements g11 benchesseating on arterials should be provided at bus stops and near intersections in green areas to provide an amenity for people waiting to cross the street or board transit additionally seating is encouraged in green areas with access to public open space or large parking areas g12 bus stops should provide overhead shelter from sun snow and rain and provide side shelter from wind and rain side panels should provide a high degree of transparency and be clear of visual obstructions g13 bicycle racks along streets should be provided adjacent to active streets containing neighborhood serving businesses when provided racks should be located in the amenity zone  003218ord   1exh 2 6418 appendix b  design guidelines design guidelines great places are defined in large party by great streets jane jacobs said it well streets and their sidewalks the main public places of a city are its most vital organs these design guidelines are intended to enable the city to work together with the development and business communities in achieving the vision for ih35e corridor that vision includes four framework themes  revitalizing the corridor will require enhancing the established character public and private realm improvements  establishing memorable destinations will require creating authentic and diverse public places while expanding the range of attractions and economic development opportunities that the corridor offers  integrating the neighborhoods will require a mix of infill housing and services for local neighbors  achieving a more accessible corridor will require improving the transportation system to minimize barriers and provide regional transportation alternatives the design guidelines are divided into two types guidelines and standards the guidelines contained in this document are general statements describing ideal development along the corridor the standards are basic requirements for any development or redevelopment along the ih35e corridor the use of these two types of statements is intended to give flexibility to the developer andor applicant to respond and contribute to the corridor vision in advance of a submittal to give the city of lewisville a basis on which to make judgments so that its determinations are not arbitrary and to give certainty to the city of lewisville and its citizens that the corridor vision is met and that the quality described is maintained the images in this section reflect examples from across the country which exemplify the written standards as time passes and the city and its partners in the public and private sector advance in achieving the corridor vision conditions along the corridor will change the standards will be added to and amended over time the guidelines and standards serve as a tool to ensure that the corridor vision and quality of corridor redevelopment remains consistently high authority these guidelines shall be approved as part of the ih35e corridor redevelopment plan according to the provisions of the general development review the review process follows the approved development process as stipulated in the city of lewisvilles adopted general development gdo the required standards of the corridor design guidelines and standards are in addition to the specific requirements of the gdo these guidelines and standards supersede all other city design guidelines except as noted a design review committee drc should be established by the city for review of projects along the ih35e corridor this committee should be responsible for the controls governing the design guidelines and standards this drc should have the responsibility to review all development within the boundaries of the corridor overlay area review of engineering requirements such as drainage  utilities  police fire and emergency service access is the responsibility of city staff the drc would have the responsibility of reviewing all design outside of the right of way while city staff has the responsibility to review the streets engineering traffic functions utility and public safety requirements the drc should be composed of both public and private individuals representatives of the private development community bring value in providing their perspective amendments these guidelines may only be amended by city council with a recommendation from the planning commission format the format of the following design guidelines consists of development conditions defined by design principle statements and design standards development conditions are described for site plan architecture landscape and signage guidelines describe the design intent for each listed condition and should be incorporated into design treatments of each listed condition standards describe the specific treatments that if incorporated require no further drc review however if standards cannot be achieved due to outstanding conditions the drc may evaluate specific condition proposed treatments against the stated guidelines if the drc approves the proposed treatments no further drc review is required appeals may be made to the planning commission a site plan a1 building orientation guidelines a1g1 the front facades and main entries of buildings should be oriented toward streets and plazas a1g2 building orientation should provide
