proportion and roof shape athe secretary of the interiors standards for the treatment of historic properties the standards are neither technical nor prescriptive but are intended to promote responsible preservation practices that help protect our nations irreplaceable cultural resources for example they cannot in and of themselves be used to make essential decisions about which features of the historic building should be saved and which can be changed but once a treatment is selected the standards provide philosophical consistency to the work the four treatment approaches are preservation rehabilitation restoration and reconstruction outlined below in hierarchical order and explained 1the first treatment preservation places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric maintenance and repair it reflects a buildings continuum over time occupancies and the respectful changes and alterations that are made 2rehabilitation the second treatment emphasizes the retention and repair of historic materials but more latitude is provided for replacement because it is assumed the property is more deteriorated prior to work both preservation and rehabilitation standards focus attention on the preservation of those materials features finishes spaces and spatial relationships that together give a property its historic character 3restoration the third treatment focuses on the retention of materials from the most significant time in a propertys history while permitting the removal of materials from other periods 4reconstruction the fourth treatment establishes limited opportunities to recreate a nonsurviving site landscape building structure or object in all new materials bstandards for preservation 1a property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that maximizes the retention of distinctive materials features spaces and spatial relationships where a treatment and use have not been identified a property will be

use occurs the amount of sdcs payable shall be determined by the following rules 1sdcs previously paid on property if sdcs had been previously paid for the property a credit in the amount of the sdcs that would be payable for the existing structure and use under the current rate schedule shall be provided for purposes of this section existing structure and use means the structure and use for which sdcs have been paid at the time of redevelopment if the sdcs payable for the new structure andor use exceed the amount of the credit the difference shall be paid to the city this rule applies regardless of the length of time between the end of the prior use and the redevelopment redevelopment to a use that results in a lower sdc amount does not reduce the amount of credit to be provided at the time of any future redevelopments any credits provided under subsection c of this section shall be deducted from the credits authorized by this section examples asdcs had been paid for three dwelling units on a property and the property is redeveloped with five dwelling units a credit for three dwelling units worth of sdcs will be provided so the amount payable would be the amount for two dwelling units bsdcs had been paid for two dwelling units and the property is redeveloped with a large retail use with both residential units eliminated the sdcs would be the difference between the sdcs payable for the new commercial structure and use and the sdcs that would be charged for two dwelling units csdcs were paid based on restaurant use but then the property was converted to another retail use with lower sdcs the property is then reconverted back to restaurant use using exactly the same configuration as the original restaurant at the time of the conversion to retail use no sdcs are payable because the amount payable is less than the credit the credit for restaurant use remains with the property so at the time of reconversion to restaurant use no additional sdcs are payable because the credit remained in effect and the credit for the original use is exactly the same as the amount that is owed thus no payment is required even if the sdc rates have increased in the interim 2sdcs not previously paid avacant land if sdcs have not been previously paid for the property a credit in the amount of the sdc charges under the current rate schedule shall be provided for any structure on the property during the 10 years immediately prior to the filing of the building permit application no sdc credit shall be provided under this subsection if there has been no structure on

following example is provided as an illustration of how the credit for qualified public improvements under subsection b7a of this section is applied a developer plans to build an offsite qualified public transportation improvement the developer must apply for the credit before starting the improvement if the city approves the credit and the developer completes the project and proves that the qualified costs total $400000 for the qualified transportation public improvement that is 100 percent sdc eligible under the sdc project list the developer would be entitled to a credit of $400000 on acceptance of the completed capital improvement if the amount of transportation improvement fees payable is less than $400000 no transportation improvement fees would be paid and a credit for the difference would be provided to be usable for future development of the property if the amount of transportation improvement fees is more than $400000 the developer would pay the difference between $400000 and the amount of the credit 8the credit for the cost of qualified public improvements is in addition to other methods of financing public improvements and may be combined with other means of

standards promulgated by epa and found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405 are incorporated into and are enforceable under this title when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the city athe city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the following criteria 1the industrial user employs or demonstrates that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit 2the industrial user uses control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard without using dilution as a substitute for treatment 3sufficient information is provided to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions 4not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge 5consistent compliance with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits ban industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the city whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates upon notification of a revised production rate city will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented under this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit cwhere the authority chooses to establish equivalent mass limits it will 1calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2when notified of a revised production rate reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent control mechanism terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to 40 cfr 4036d and this title the industrial user must also be in compliance with 40 cfr 40317 regarding the prohibition of bypass   state

development in the cb zone must follow one of the two tracks for obtaining design review approval 1track 1  administrative review of compliance with design standards track 1 requires applicants to meet objective development and design standards design standards are quantifiable and measurable these applications are reviewed type ii process which reduces the amount of time that it takes to get the project reviewed track 1 provides an efficient time saving alternative to track 2 2track 2  cb zone design review of compliance with design guidelines track 2 similarly requires applicants to meet objective development standards but does not require some or all of the design standards in the track 2 process applications are reviewed type iii process before the planning commission during their review the planning commission will determine whether an application meets the design guidelines unlike design standards design guidelines are discretionary in track 2 the intent statements serve as the criteria for determining if the intent of the design standard is being met in track 2 applicants are required to identify how their proposed sitebuilding plan meets the intent statements of the design standards and why specific objective standards cannot be met fapplication requirements if the development is nonexempt the applicant shall file an application for cb zone design review with the

development of a cohesive exciting and vibrant street life approach all streetfacing elevations must have front doors that face the street and meet at least one of the following options courtyardplaza option embellish the pedestrian zone by creating accessible courtyardsplazas as extension of the sidewalk the public realm incorporate pedestrian amenities such as street trees outdoor seating display areas public art humanscale lighting and decorative pavers street edge option orient the primary entrance to the building along the streetfacing property line fostering a continuous and cohesive edge and defining inside from outside recessed entry option createenhance semipublic transition areas between the sidewalk public realm and the recessed entry door private realm define this area with lighting that draws attention to groundfloor window displays signage and the buildings architectural details supplement the lighting with special paving treatments that emphasize the entry tile etched concrete andor brick asphalt is prohibited arcade option design an arcade that meets the following requirements the columns and piers that support the building above are six to 10 feet deep between the front property line and the parallel building wall the columns and piers consist of openings that are a minimum of six feet wide the columns and piers are a minimum of 18 inches from the property

arcade option meets the groundfloor window standard  provided that the groundfloor building facade behind the arcade meets the 50 percent length and 60 percent wall glazing requirement buildings with two or more frontages are only required to meet the arcade option along one street facade however if the arcade is proposed on both street frontages the minimum spacing for openings is required along the entire opening 2human scale intent building facades must be designed in a manner that is aesthetically appealing comfortable to pedestrians and compatible with the character of the surrounding built environment as a way of emphasizing human scale approach provide visual interest for pedestrians by incorporating building details at the ground floor that relate to the surrounding built environment and are at a human scale this is to be accomplished by meeting two or more of the following options incorporating building lighting between 10 and 15 feet from the sidewalk to the bottom of the light fixture incorporating suspended signs blade signs between eight and 12 feet from the sidewalk to the bottom of the suspended sign incorporating horizontal and vertical elements at the ground floorthe base of the building that are familiar to pedestrians and are at human scale sign frieze storefront cornice window mullions piers that frame storefronts engaged columns arcades brick coursings awnings and welllit transoms incorporating a rhythm of awnings andor canopies pedestrianoriented lighting is required between structural bays  lighting must follow a consistent spacing pattern 3physical visual and experiential connections intent incorporating interesting features into a buildingsite to emphasize the role that physical visual and experiential connections give to creating meaningful places approach embellish the buildings with two or more of the following elements a variety of building materials stone brick concrete wood metal and glass use of colors that are contextual to bend and the larger pacific northwest landscape serve to embellish the building and the public realm traditional central business zones like bends cb zone often consist of tripart buildings where the base middle and top of the building are defined by color texture and materials architectural elements such as cornices arcades porticos and transom windows tripart building facades that emphasize a clear base middle and top traditional style storefront buildings typically include an uninterrupted band commonly referred to as a bulkhead kickplate doors window base or a base panel around the base of the building this band is approximately 16 inches above the sidewalk and serves to anchor the building to the site this band is most often constructed of wood concrete brick stone or metal using tape or paint for the bulkhead is prohibited display windows in traditional storefront buildings are typically terminated in the base band or bulkhead the bulkhead window frame and windowsill hold the window and help to further accentuate relief in the building facade the top of the storefront is architecturally capped by horizontal elements including sign bands storefront cornices and transoms these features serve as a transition device from the base of the building to the middle of the building 4cohesive elements intent incorporate cohesive and repetitive elements into the building as a means of enhancing the pedestrian realm and giving meaning to the building approach incorporate three or more of the following repetitive building elements building lighting columns engaged columnspilasters and arcades suspended signs blade signs canopies andor awnings transoms balconies architects and designers are encouraged to think creatively above and beyond the groundfloor window requirements specified in the design standards besides implementing cohesive elements architects and designers should consider the interplay of shadows and light and vertical and horizontal architectural features on neighboring buildings 5integrate building parapets and rooftops intent treat the top of the building the point where the edifice meets the sky as part of the larger facade composition and where possible accentuate the ornamentation found on existing traditional cb zone buildings fully screen all rooftop mechanical equipment from the adjacent sidewalk approach create visual interest at the top of the building by incorporating one of the following options integrating elements at the roofline such as detailed eaves projected cornices and articulated parapets incorporating rooftop forms other than flat roofs that add visual interest to the facade sloped roof heights from eave to peak should not exceed the height from grade to the eave the roof should not be taller than the building wall supporting the roof designing rooftop gardens for the purpose of managing stormwater runoff into bends rivers and streams andor as a place for people to gather screening for rooftop mechanical equipment is to be opaque rooftop equipment is required to be set back from the parapet or building edge a minimum of 10 feet screened mechanical equipment is exempt from the height requirement 6weather protection projections intent weather protection shall be provided along buildings adjacent to pedestrian walkways approach provide weather protection for pedestrians along 50 percent of the groundfloor facade that is required to be on the property line and at all streetfacing entrances awnings marquees balconies overhangs umbrellas fabric tensile structures building appendages or other weather protection projections are required to extend five feet over the sidewalk 7reinforce the corner intent create dynamic public gathering spaces where streets intersect by embellishing the corner of the building approach incorporate one or more of the following elements place the highest andor the most visible part of the building within 25 feet of the corner use architectural features such as cupolas turrets and hipped or pitched roofs to add prominence to the corner location locate the mainprimary entry to the building within 25 feet of the corner or at the corner itself emphasize the corners of the building as a gathering place by extending paving materials that front the building to the property line the following elements typically define the corner entry round or chamfered corners with double doors doors with large amounts of glass awningscanopies and more defined vertical elements columns 8pedestrianoriented ground floor intent ensure that the ground floor of the primary street facade is distinguished from the upper floors and that there is the sense of interaction between activities in the building and activities on the sidewalk create storefronts and entries that are visible transparent and easily accessible from the street approach emphasize the importance of the ground floor especially the primary streetfacing entry by incorporating three or more of the following elements extraheight entry lobby space continuous welllit transom windows enhanced distinctive doorway treatments decorative lighting projecting or recessing the entry bays incorporating artwork into the facade that is visible to pedestrians on the sidewalk incorporating unified paving materials textures and color paving material in recessed entriesvestibules should help emphasize the transition from the sidewalk to the building 9alley facade treatment intent design alley facades that share a corner with streetfacing facades to be inviting and safe for pedestrians approach incorporate the following facade elements wrap the required street facing fenestration into the alley a minimum of 10 feet add exterior lighting along the entire length of the alleyfacing facade to enhance visibility and safety windows facing the alley must be transparent to ensure that the alley is monitored by people inside the building eyes on the street 10urban materials intent ensure that building materials are compatible with welldesigned surrounding buildings and where possible embrace the natural features geology of the region approach incorporate one or more of the following elements at the ground floor use materials that give the base of the building a sense of permanence with the use of brick metal terra cotta stone concrete block or stucco clearly distinguish the ground floor from the upper floors by implementing strong horizontal elements such as a frieze or a cornice andor changing materials andor arranging the upper windows which are different in size than the storefront windows in a consistent and rhythmic pattern ensure that the design of the upper floors is cohesive with that of the ground floor extension of actual guidelines brick expansion joints and downspouts and implied guidelines cornices transoms balconies and window mullions do not use materials that appear synthetic and are not compatible with materials materials that are indigenous to the region found on many of bends existing buildings undesirable materials and treatments include mirrored glass vinyl siding cementitious siding falsebrick veneer and synthetic stucco jgeneral provisions 1floor area ratios floor area ratios fars regulate the amount of use the intensity allowed on a site fars also work with the height setback and building coverage standards to control the overall bulk of development fars are calculated by dividing the building floor area by the size of the development area 2groundfloor windows in the cb zone groundfloor streetfacing windows are intended to provide a pleasant rich and diverse pedestrian experience by connecting activities occurring within a structure to adjacent sidewalk areas encourage continuity of retail and service uses create an exciting pedestrian environment create a visual dialogue between activities in the building and activities on the sidewalk windows must be at least 50 percent of the length and 60 percent of the ground level wall area ground level wall areas include all exterior wall areas up to 10 feet above the finished grade 3height height limits are intended to control the overall scale of buildings the maximum building height within the cb zone emphasizes pedestrians and a mix of uses exceptions to maximum height projection allowed projections and architectural elements that do not add habitable interior floor area to a building such as chimneys spires steeples clock towers skylights atriums elevator shaft housings stair enclosures trellises railings flag poles signs mechanical equipment and screens antennas and other similar items not used for human occupancy shall be allowed to exceed the maximum allowable building height limit by 10 feet 4landscaped areas landscaping is not required in the cb zone except for the fivefoot buffer next to residential zones landscaping is intended to soften the effects of built and paved areas it also helps reduce stormwater runoff by providing a surface into which stormwater can percolate 5main entrance fronting the main entrance of a building to the street enhances pedestrian access between the use inside the building and activities on the sidewalk this orientation also enables building occupants to see what is happening in the street such as arriving transit service kpedestrian standards the pedestrian standards encourage a safe attractive and usable pedestrian circulation system in all developments they ensure a direct pedestrian connection between the street and buildings on the site and between buildings and other activities within the site in addition they provide for connections between adjacent sites where feasible a sidewalk circulation system must be hardsurfaced and be at least six feet wide where the system crosses driveways parking areas and loading areas the system must be clearly identifiable use of elevation changes speed bumps a different paving material or other similar methods the onsite pedestrian circulation system must be illuminated to a level where employees residents and customers can use the system at night land between a building and the street property line must be landscaped andor hardsurfaced for use by pedestrians lsetbacks setbacks promote streetscapes that are consistent with the desired character of the zones the cb zone promotes buildings close to the sidewalk to reinforce a pedestrian orientation and builtup streetscape the setback requirements for areas that abut residential zones promote commercial development that will maintain light air and privacy in residential zones the following items are allowed to encroach into setbacks canopies marquees and awnings uncovered stairways and wheelchair ramps that lead to the streetfacing facade uncovered decks and stairways that are no more than two and onehalf feet above ground mechanical structures such as heat pumps air conditioners and emergency generators are not allowed        formerly  mixeduse zoning districts me mr po mu and mn purpose and applicability permitted and conditional uses development standards site layout and building

plan image figure a the area covered by the lava ridge refinement plan is approximately 700 acres of partially developed land on the northeast edge of bend it is bounded on the north by cooley road to the east by the urban growth boundary to the south by empire boulevard and to the west by the railroad the purpose of the lava ridge refinement plan is to create overlay zoning standards for the residential and commercial districts within the refinement plan area the refinement plan objectives are identify and coordinate street and utility locations develop a street plan that will allow individual property owner to develop independently and still create an interconnected street system and compatible uses designated neighborhood open space and provide a mechanism for construction and maintenance of designated parks determine density locations and ranges that will allow flexibility for individual property owners establish design standards for street sidewalks and building locations to create streetscapes that are safe and accessible for pedestrians the plan promotes the development of neighborhoods based on traditional planning principles a network of connected streets some narrower than the current standard will help to reduce cutwhile distributing local traffic more evenly neighborhood parks are provided particularly in higher density areas neighborhood commercial at

manufactured home park redevelopment overlay  manufactured home park redevelopment overlay  purpose and applicability apurpose manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks provide a significant amount of the citys affordable housing when a manufactured home park redevelops this type of affordable housing stock is lost leaving the residents of those parks with few options the purpose of the manufactured home park redevelopment overlay is to implement city by providing incentives to the park owners to continue the use of the land as a manufactured home park and when redevelopment does occur by providing a mechanism for capturing a portion of the redevelopment potential as replacement affordable housing the manufactured home park redevelopment overlay creates overlay development standards for increased residential housing and where appropriate commercial and mixeduse development and designated open space within existing manufactured home park boundaries the overlay development standards will provide a variety of housing types for a variety of markets  promote pedestrian and other multimodal transportation options  ensure compatibility of uses within

and retaining walls  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote community health safety and welfare by protecting natural vegetation and setting development standards for landscaping street trees fences and walls together these elements of the natural and built environment contribute to the visual quality environmental health and character of the community trees provide climate control during summer months and wind screening during winter trees reduce stormwater runoff and are a valuable component of the citys infrastructure trees and other plants also buffer pedestrians from traffic walls fences trees and other landscape materials provide vital screening and buffering between land uses landscaped areas help to control surface water drainage by capturing rainwater within their canopies and can improve air and water quality   landscape conservation landscape conservation prevents the indiscriminate removal of significant trees and other vegetation including vegetation associated with streams wetlands and other protected natural resource areas this section crossreferences bdc  and  which regulate development of areas of special interest the purpose of this section is to incorporate significant native vegetation into the landscapes of development the use of existing mature native vegetation within developments is a preferred alternative to removal of vegetation and replanting mature landscaping provides summer shade and wind breaks allows for water conservation due to larger plants having established root systems and assists with erosion control within disturbed construction sites aapplicability the standards in this section shall apply to all development sites containing significant vegetation as defined below except for residential development on residential district lots that were created subdivision or partition plat filed with deschutes county prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this code bsignificant vegetation significant vegetation means individual trees with a specific trunk diameter as measured four feet above the ground known as dbh diameter at breast height  shall be inventoried during the site design process and protected during construction unless otherwise approved for removal site plan review process for the purpose of this section deciduous trees measuring six inches or greater and coniferous trees measuring 10 inches or greater shall be considered significant vegetation cmapping and protection required a tree protection plan shall be prepared and submitted with the development application significant vegetation shall be inventoried and mapped as required by bdc site plan review and design review bdc  waterway overlay zone woz and  upland areas of special interest overlay zone trees shall be mapped individually and identified by species and size dbh a protection area shall be defined around the edge of all branches dripline of each tree driplines may overlap between trees or stand of trees the city also may require an inventory survey or assessment prepared by a qualified professional when necessary to determine tree health vegetation boundaries building setbacks and other protection or mitigation requirements dprotection standards significant trees identified as meeting the criteria in subsection b of this section shall be retained unless approved by the city to be removed for development preservation shall be considered impracticable when it would prevent development of public streets public utilities needed housing or land uses permitted by the applicable land use district the term prevent in this standard means that the development cannot be designed to avoid the significant trees an inability to achieve maximum permitted density by complying with this subsection shall not in itself be considered to prevent development building envelopes commensurate with the lot coverage standard of the zone shall be depicted on the tree protection plan trees outside the envelope shall be protected unless they prevent development in instances where applying exceptions to certain development standards would make tree preservation practical the city may allow one or more of the following exceptions to the development standards when individual trees with a dbh of 24 inches or larger or stands of trees that are in good health as determined by a qualified professional are preserved by a proposed development with an approved tree preservation plan reductions of setbacks up to 25 percent reduction of required onsite parking up to 10 percent increased lot coverage up to 15 percent reduced landscape coverage up to five percent 1protection of significant trees the applicant must submit a tree protection plan on a site plan map drawn to scale that includes the following provisions where appropriate ainventory of significant vegetation depict all significant vegetation by dbh and species showing property lines twofoot contours and

exact locations of all utility trenches  erect physical barriers around all trees to be retained or groups of trees around the work site barriers that extend beyond the dripline of the tree are preferred dsoil compaction the tree protection plan shall depict typical details of methods for protecting the critical root zone if barriers are not feasible to keep away vehicles and foot traffic use six to eight inches of wood chips spread over the root zone or bridge root area overlaid by plates of steel or other suitable material egrade changes if a grade change is unavoidable retaining walls shall be used to protect the root system fsevering roots avoid cutting anchoring roots if possible tunneling for smaller household utility lines may be an option for tree preservation when root cuts are unavoidable the cuts shall be made with a pruning saw gaboveground injuries to trees do not use trees for posting signs electrical wires and pulleys keep trees free of nails screws and other fastening devices prevent trunk injuries by surrounding trunk with oneinch by fourinch wooden slats and securing in place with gauge wire around slats hsoil contamination altering the soil chemistry can result in weakened trees making them more susceptible to insects and disease prevent adverse effects on soil chemistry by spreading heavy plastic tarping where concrete is to be mixed or sheet rock cut  do not clean paintbrushes and tools over tree roots  dispose of chemical wastes properly and do not drain onto soil ialtering the natural drainage course when the natural drainage of a site is altered watering for existing trees must be augmented by an irrigation system prior to site grading prepare a site drainage plan sometimes surface water containment can sustain existing stands of trees without artificial irrigation 2the city may approve the provision for substituting the retention of smaller trees in lieu of significant trees if it can be determined by a qualified professional that the small trees have equal or greater measurable benefits as specified in the purpose of this section andor that the significant trees will not survive 3all existing trees in good health as determined by a qualified professional which are located within the front yard setback or within an undeveloped public rightofway shall be conserved whenever practical 4when the removal of significant trees cannot be avoided the city may require as part of the required landscaping plan for the development site the replacement of trees in size and number equivalent to the square inch measurement at dbh econstruction all areas of significant vegetation shall be protected prior to during and after construction grading operation of vehicles and heavy equipment and storage of supplies and construction materials are prohibited within significant vegetation areas except as approved in writing by the city for installation of utilities or streets such approval shall only be granted after the city concludes in writing that there is no other reasonable alternative to avoid the protected area and any required mitigation is provided in conformance with bdc c mitigation for the removal of vegetation the written approval shall include the specific facts that support the conclusion fperformance bond to ensure that the significant trees identified development review process will be retained and protected the review authority may require the developer to post a performance bond in an amount determined by the size of the trees being preserved as shown below tree size bond amount 4  6 inches dbh $1000 6  10 inches dbh $1500 10  16 inches dbh $3000 greater than 16 inches dbh $5000 the amount of the required performance bond shall be determined by totaling the number of trees being preserved based on size and bonding value in the above table the developer may utilize one of the following methods to assure full and faithful performance 1a surety bond executed by a surety company authorized to transact business in the state of oregon in a form approved by the city attorney 2a cash deposit in a city account at an approved lending institution 3an irrevocable standby letter of credit from a federally insured banking institution or savings and loan operating in oregon that unconditionally promises to pay the funds pledged upon demand by the city such obligation must be unaffected by the financial status of the person who has obtained the letter of credit 4an assurance provider arrangement between the developer the city and a federally insured financial institution which assures the city that funds to mitigate the loss or damage of significant trees identified development review process for preservation and protection will be provided by the federally insured financial institution to the city in the event the developer does not perform in conformance with the land use development agreement and the federally insured financial institution must be satisfactory to the city 5the city may place a second position lien on the subject property the lien shall accrue interest at the rate of six percent until such time the lien amount has been collected the lien amount shall be paid to the city in full prior to the final occupancy of a building or final plat recordation of a subdivision or partition plat gtermination of bond if the developer fails to carry out the provisions of the agreement the city shall call upon the bond or letter of credit or cash deposit or property lien or assurance provider arrangement to finance any cost or expenses resulting from said failure if the amount of the deposit letter of credit bond or property lien or assurance provider arrangement exceeds the cost and expense incurred by mitigating the loss or damage of the significant trees the city shall deposit the remainder into a city account for the purpose of tree preservation education tree planting and maintenance if the amount of the deposit letter of credit bond or assurance provider arrangement is less than the cost and expense incurred by the city for the improvements and repairs the developer shall be liable to the city for

use the land efficiently while maintaining the visual character of the community this chapter recognizes that each development has unique parking needs by providing a flexible approach for determining parking space requirements ie minimum and performancebased standards this chapter also provides standards for bicycle parking because many people use bicycles for recreation commuting and general transportation children as well as adults need safe and adequate spaces to park their bicycles throughout the community   applicability all development within the city of bend shall comply with the

including transportation facilities  sewer water and other utilities  and drainage features and activities one of the primary purposes of this chapter is to provide standards for attractive and safe streets that can accommodate vehicle traffic from planned growth and provide a range of transportation options including options for driving walking bicycling transit and other transportation modes this chapter is intended to guide development implementation of the city of bend standards and specifications bpublic improvements needed for development development shall not occur unless the public improvements serving the development comply with the public facility requirements established or incorporated by this chapter unless compliance is exempted by this code or unless the applicable standard is modified or waived under bdc  ccompliance with standards all public improvements constructed as part of a development or to comply with a condition of development approval shall comply with all applicable standards including but not limited to any standards and specifications adopted by the city applicable to public works or public improvements the provisions of this chapter prevail over any inconsistent standard or specification unless the applicable standard is modified or waived under bdc  dconditions of development approval no development shall occur unless required public facilities are in place or guaranteed improvements required to be constructed by the developer as a condition of development approval when not voluntarily accepted by the applicant shall be roughly proportional to the impact of development on public facilities and services findings in the development approval shall indicate how the required improvements are related to and roughly proportional to the impact the city may deny an application if required public improvements are not in place or the city may impose conditions of approval tying the timing of construction andor occupancy of a

aauthority to grant waiver or modification waivers andor modifications of the standards of this chapter andor the city of bend standards and specifications may be granted as part of a development approval only if the criteria of subsection b of this section are met a waiver for sidewalks for the woodriver village subdivision is not permitted under this subsection see bdc  payment in lieu of sidewalk construction bcriteria the review authority after considering the recommendation of the city engineer may waive or modify the standards of this title and the city of bend standards and specifications based on a determination that 1 the waiver or modification will not harm or will be beneficial to the public in general  2 the waiver and modification are not inconsistent with the general purpose of ensuring adequate public facilities  and 3 one or more of the following conditions are met 1the modification or waiver is necessary to eliminate or reduce impacts on existing drainage patterns or natural features such as riparian areas significant trees or vegetation or steep slopes 2an existing structure such as a substantial retaining wall makes widening a street or rightofway or required placement of lines impractical or undesirable 3street access to an existing lot would be eliminated without the waiver or modification 4building on an existing lot would be infeasible without the waiver or modification 5the standard is a street or rightofway standard and existing structures on the same side of the block make future widening of the remainder of the street or rightofway unlikely and the additional width on the project site would not be beneficial for sidewalks or parking without the extension for the rest of the block 6the modification or waiver is needed to allow development of or street access to the property because of topographical constraints 7the existing infrastructure a does not meet current standards b is and will remain functionally equivalent to current standards and c there is little likelihood that current standards will be met in the area 8the installation of the required improvements would likely cause unacceptable significant adverse environmental impacts and the waivermodification would avoid such impacts 9there is insufficient rightofway to allow a full width street crosssection and additional rightofway cannot be provided 10there is no street or rightofway adjacent to the property and easement access has been obtained across private property 11required street frontage improvements for individual singlefamily dwellings could best be accomplished by planned areawide improvements at a future date 12the city has conflicting or inconsistent standards and the proposal would comply with one set of adopted standards standards are conflicting or inconsistent only when it is not possible to comply with both in most situations the more recently adopted standard should be followed and the older standard may be waived maximization of the number of lots or parcels in a land division is not a reason to allow a waiver or modification cother requirements not waived any waivers under this section do not exempt the developer from submitting plans which meet all other applicable specifications dapplication requirements the application for a waiver or modification shall be in writing submitted as part of a development application the city council may adopt a fee for a waivermodification application by resolution the application shall specify which requirements of this chapter andor the city of bend standards and specifications are at issue and which of the conditions listed above are met the application shall contain a statement explaining why the deviation from the required standards is necessary and why the waiver or modification sought will not harm or will be beneficial to the general public econditions the city may impose a condition of approval requiring a signed agreement not to remonstrate against the formation of a local improvement district           payment in lieu of sidewalk construction revised 919 aproperties within the woodriver village subdivision must make a payment in lieu of constructing a sidewalk per lot which is not required to construct a sidewalk as a condition of development approval the payment will be established in the citys fee resolution the payment requirement is limited to the woodriver village subdivision and is based on the unique characteristics of the woodriver village subdivision as follows 1the subdivision was approved in

bonus a developer may be eligible for a density bonus when a percentage of the proposed dwelling units are affordable the percentage of affordable units is based on the maximum number of dwelling units that would be allowed under the comprehensive plan designation for the subject site the corresponding density bonus in table c is an increase in dwelling units over the maximum residential density that can be rented or sold as affordable units or at market rate the maximum density must be calculated in compliance with bdc c1 for purposes of calculating maximum density fractional units are rounded down to the next whole unit for purposes of calculating the number of affordable units and density bonus units fractional units are rounded up to the next whole unit for example a 10000 square foot lot designated rh is permitted nine units maximum density is rounded down of the nine units the developer proposes 20 percent of the units to be affordable nine units  20 percent   18 units which is rounded up to two units therefore of the nine units two must be affordable since the applicant is proposing 20 percent of the units as affordable the developer may receive a corresponding density bonus of 20 percent nine units  20 percent   18 units which is rounded up to two additional units therefore the proposed project may have eleven units two of which must be
