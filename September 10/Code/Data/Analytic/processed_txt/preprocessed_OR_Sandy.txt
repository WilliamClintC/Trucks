utility exists for the benefit of any person within the city who desires public storm drainage facilities available for the diversion collection andor disposal of storm drainage and other runoff water from the persons property and represents a municipal service in a developed urban environment which is essential to the public health safety and welfare b persons who use the public storm drainage facilities ought to be charged fees that reflect the costs of the use relative to the management maintenance extension and construction of the public storm drainage facility as a public utility in the city c accordingly the structure of the storm drainage utility is intended to be a fee for service and not a charge against property although this structure is intended to 36 constitute a service fee

engineering geology under the provisions of ors  to  appendix b guidelines for preparing engineering geologic reports in oregon adopted by the oregon state board of geologist examiners this is a suggested guide for the preparation of an engineering geologic report in oregon the engineering geologic report should include sufficient facts and interpretation regarding geologic materials processes and history to allow evaluation of the suitability of the site for the proposed use because of the wide variation in size and complexity of projects and scope of work the guidelines are intended to be flexible and should be tailored to the specific project the guidelines are intended to be fairly complete  however not all items would be applicable to small projects or lowrisk sites in addition some items may be addressed in separate reports prepared by a geotechnical engineer geophysicist structural engineer or hydrologist the guidelines are based on a publication developed by the guidelines committee of the utah the association of engineering geologists a series of guidelines published by the california division of mines and geology in the cdmg note series and the bulletin of the association of engineering geologists slosson 1984 general information the following items should be addressed  client or party that commissioned the report  names of geologists who did the mapping and other investigation on which the report is based and dates when the work was done  location and size of area and its general setting with respect to major or regional geographic and

which shows sufficient detail to adequately define the geologic conditions present for many purposes available published geologic maps are unsuitable to provide a basis for understanding the site conditions so independent geologic mapping is needed if available published geologic maps are used to portray site conditions they must be updated to reflect geologic or topographic changes which have occurred since map publication it may be necessary for the geologist to extend mapping into adjacent areas to adequately define significant geologic conditions  mapping should be done on a suitable topographic base or aerial photograph at an appropriate scale with satisfactory horizontal and vertical control the date and source of the base should be included on each map or photo  the geologist doing the investigation and preparing the map should report the nature of bedrock and surficial materials the structural features and relationships and the threedimensional distribution of earth materials exposed and inferred within the area a clear distinction should be made between observed and inferred features and relationships  the report should include one or more appropriately positioned and scaled cross sections to show subsurface relationships that cannot be adequately described in words alone fence or block diagrams may also be appropriate geologic descriptions the report should contain brief but complete descriptions of all natural materials and structural features recognized or inferred within the subject area where interpretations are added to the recording of direct observations the basis for such interpretations should be clearly stated describe all field mapping and exploration procedures surface geologic reconnaissance drilling trenching geophysical

normally applied to a particular district  adjustments adjustments are a type i or type ii procedure that provide a means to vary the development standards normally applied in a particular district this option exists for those circumstances where uniform  unvarying rules would prevent a more efficient use of a lot a typical example is permitting a structure to be located closer to a property boundary than normally allowed by the zoning district regulations adjustments apply only to individual lots and therefore cannot be used by applicants seeking to vary development standards for lots to be created subdivision process modifications to land divisions standards should be sought type ii or type iii variance process or where appropriate the planned development process an adjustment is intended to a allow more efficient use of land b provide flexibility and innovation in site planning and architectural design on individual lots c permit building location andor construction techniques that conserve energy d minimize procedural delays and ensure due process in the review of unique development situations e provide relief from the strict adherence of land division development standards where sitespecific physical or functional land development conditions warrant a variance  type i adjustments in issuing a permit the director may grant or deny an adjustment under the type i procedure if the request involves only the expansion or reduction by not more than 10% of one or more quantifiable provisions of this code  type ii adjustments except in the case of a nonconforming development or use the director may grant or deny an adjustment under the type ii procedure if the request involves only the expansion or reduction by not more than 20% of one or more quantifiable provisions of this code  type i and ii adjustment criteria a the proposed development will not be contrary to the purposes of this chapter policies of the comprehensive plan and any other applicable policies and standards adopted by the city  1766  2 b the proposed development will not substantially reduce the amount of privacy enjoyed by users of nearby structures when compared to the same development located as specified by this   c the proposed development will not adversely affect existing physical systems and natural systems such as traffic drainage dramatic land forms or parks  and d architectural features of the proposed development will be compatible to the design character of existing structures on adjoining properties and on the proposed development site  adjustment limitations adjustments may not be utilized to a reduce width of accessways required for flag lots created land partition or minor replat process b reduce the area reserved for private outdoor space andor usable open space by more than 10% c reduce project site amenities such as screening andor landscaping provisions by more than 10% d increase fence height inside clearvision areas  variances variances are a means of requesting a complete waiver or major adjustment to certain development standards they may be requested for a specific lot or as part of a land division application the type ii variance process is generally reserved for major adjustments on individual lots while variances to development standards proposed as part of a land division are processed as a type iii application requiring a public hearing  type ii and type iii variance criteria the authority to grant a variance does not include authority to approve a development that is designed arranged or intended for a use not otherwise approvable in the location the criteria are as follows a the circumstances necessitating the variance are not of the applicants making b the hardship does not arise from a violation of this approval will not allow otherwise prohibited uses in the district in which the property is located c granting of the variance will not adversely affect implementation of the comprehensive plan d the variance authorized will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or materially injurious to other property in the vicinity 1766  3 e the development will be the same as development permitted under this code and city standards to the greatest extent that is reasonably possible while permitting some economic use of the land f special circumstances or conditions apply to the property which do not apply generally to other properties in the same zone or vicinity and result from lot size or shape legally existing prior to the effective date of this  topography or other circumstances over which the applicant has no control  type iii special variances the planning commission may grant a special variance waiving a specified provision for under the type iii procedure if it finds that the provision is unreasonable and unwarranted due to the specific nature of the proposed development in submitting an application for a type iii special variance the proposed development explanation shall provide facts and evidence sufficient to enable the planning commission to make findings in compliance with the criteria set forth in this section while avoiding conflict with the comprehensive plan one of the following sets of criteria shall be applied as appropriate a the unique nature of the proposed development is such that 1 the intent and purpose of the regulations and of the provisions to be waived will not be violated  and 2 authorization of the special variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare and will not be injurious to other property in the area when compared with the effects of development otherwise permitted b the variance approved is the minimum variance needed to permit practical compliance with a requirement of another law or regulation c when restoration or replacement of a nonconforming development is necessary due to damage by fire flood or other casual or natural disaster the restoration or replacement will decrease the degree of the previous noncompliance to the greatest extent possible  application an application for an adjustment or variance shall be made on forms provided by the director and include the following where applicable a description of the land address lot block tract or similar description on which the proposed development is to take place b narrative addressing how the application meets the specified review criteria c site plan no larger than 11 in by 17 in include a reduced copy if drawn larger suitable for photocopy reproduction the site plan shall be drawn to scale and show 1

type prior to the decision date the review of a type i or ii adjustment or variance and any comments received may cause the director to elevate the request to a type iii variance in this case the director shall notify the applicant and any parties in writing giving the reasons that the application is found to qualify as a type iii variance requesting any additional information required by this requesting any additional fees applicable under the redefined application type upon receipt of new application materials and payment of the revised application fee the director shall schedule a public hearing and serve public notice as required in this period of approval approval of an adjustment or variance shall be effective for a 2year period from the date of approval unless substantial construction has taken place the director type i and type ii or planning commission type iii may grant a 1year extension if the applicant requests such an extension prior to expiration of the initial time limit 1768  1 revised by effective  chapter 1768  conditional uses  intent certain uses listed in each zoning district require special review to determine what their effects may be to the
