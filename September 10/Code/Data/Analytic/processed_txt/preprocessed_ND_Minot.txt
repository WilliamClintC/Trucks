thereof moreover the notice shall state that the proposed budget is available for inspection at the office of the city clerk subject to reasonable rules and regulations any interested person may address the council at the hearing with respect to any part of the budget if it deems it desirable the city council may continue the hearing from time to time but no public notice of the reopened hearing need be given except as is given with respect to meetings of the council generally  adoption of the official budget  subsequent amendments  effect thereof a insofar as section 2163 prescribes the format to be followed in setting forth the contents of the budget that format shall be observed by the council in establishing the official budget for the budget year however in all other respects the council may change any other aspect of the budget recommended by the city manager which changes may be made prior to during or after the public hearing provided for in section 2163 however final approval of the budget shall not be accomplished until the public hearing is finally closed without provision being made for a continuance thereof b the final adoption of the budget shall be by way of the annual budget ordinance which ordinance shall be passed on second reading no later than the second business day prior to october 10th c the annual tax levy ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance shall consist of the aggregate of the various tax levies set forth therein with respect to the funds established in the budget which aggregate tax levy shall be certified by the city auditor to the county auditor for collection as prescribed by state law d the annual appropriation ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance shall constitute an appropriation of the projected expenditures set forth therein except to the extent that prior appropriation of anticipated expenditures is waived in section 2165 hereof e from time to time the council may amend the budget ordinance in two 2 respects 1 it may transfer appropriations from one particular fund to another particular fund or it may add new line items within a fund or both in so doing it may act by way of resolution notwithstanding the fact that the original appropriations in question were made by way of ordinance it is the intent and understanding of the city council that this procedure was authorized by ndcc 404017 at the time of the adoption of the city of minot home rule charter that resolutions of the sort contemplated by this subparagraph are consequently an inherent aspect of the annual appropriation ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance as the term annual appropriation ordinance was understood at the time of the enactment of the home rule charter and that therefore these resolutions are not referable under article iv of the home rule charter 2 it may from time to time by way of an ordinance increase the aggregate total of appropriations during the course of the budget year in order to reflect changes in financial circumstances either not contemplated in the annual budget ordinance at the time of its adoption or which financial circumstances by their very nature are difficult to estimate with exactitude at the time of the enactment of the annual budget ordinance for example the creation of a new source of revenue such as a new city sales tax or income tax or the availability of funds new federal or state grant program would form the basis for an increase in appropriations pursuant to this subparagraph and the case would be likewise with respect to an unexpected significant increase in variable sources of income such as user fees or license and permit fees it is the intent and understanding of the city council that the procedure established in this subparagraph was not authorized by state law at the time of adoption of the home rule charter of the city of minot but rather this procedure represents an exercise of home rule powers that therefore this procedure cannot be viewed as an inherent aspect of the annual appropriation ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance so that consequently such an ordinance as provided for in this subparagraph amending the annual budget ordinance is referable under article iv of the home rule charter f the annual appropriation ordinance component of the annual budget ordinance shall be considered an ordinance implementing those powers or functions of city government funded therein which powers or functions are available to the city of minot only by virtue of its home rule powers insofar as implementation by ordinance of home rule powers is required under of the north dakota century the city of minot home rule charter  limitations on expenditures  exceptions  liability

subsequent amendments to the annual budget ordinance sufficient to pay such expenditure or liability except as provided for in subsections c and d below however as long as the rule in the prior sentence is observed an amount of authorized expenditure with respect to a particular line item or category of expenditures may be exceeded in order to accommodate or to reflect actual operating experience for an illustration of what is meant by line item or category of expenditures see section 2163e3 and 4 b no expenditure shall be made nor liability shall be incurred with respect to a particular purpose without prior city council approval unless that purpose is described with reasonable certainty by a particular line item description in the annual budget ordinance to which the expenditure or liability relates for purposes of this section a line item of miscellaneous shall serve as authority for miscellaneous expenditures without prior city council approval only to the extent the amount is originally established in the annual budget ordinance or an amendment thereto if city council approval under this subsection is required and is obtained then regardless of the form by which such approval is expressed the approval shall serve as an amendment to the budget ordinance under section 2164e1 c no appropriation in the annual budget ordinance or amendment thereto shall be necessary for expenditures 1 made from special assessment funds provided for in of the north dakota century in division 5 of this article  2 made with respect to payments from the city

those expenditures incurred by the enterprise funds and special revenue funds of the city which expenditures represent the cost of goods sold by the enterprises if it should develop in the course of the budget year that the sales to which the expenditures relate are higher than projected at the time of the adoption of the annual budget ordinance provided that however this paragraph shall constitute authority for such increased expenditures only if the variable costs associated with making sales in excess of the projected level of sales are less than the revenues derived therefrom e

section 2122 and subject to the exceptions set forth therein  provided that however 1 the city manager may authorize the incurring of liabilities or the making of expenditures to the extent that he is authorized to do so in division 2 of this article  2 the library board shall provide final authorization for the expenditure of library funds  and 3 the pension boards shall provide final

untraveled portion of the public rightofway creates a special hazard and matter of public concern because a sign by its very nature and purpose is designed and maintained to invite the notice and attention of passersby and consequently the closer a sign is placed to the traveled portion of the rightofway the greater the potential for distracting the attention of motorists or pedestrians or both thus increasing the risk of traffic accidents 2 in this regard a sign located within the public rightofway is qualitatively different from other projections or fixtures placed and maintained within the rightofway so that a prohibition on such sign placement and maintenance is justified by the health and safety interests of the community even though such interests may not or do not justify a flat prohibition on the construction and maintenance of any improvements whatsoever within the untraveled portion of the public rightofway indeed the authority to enact and to enforce such an all encumbancing prohibition is questionable given the holding of the north dakota supreme court in the case of hjelle v jc snyder & sons 133 nw 2d 265 which further justifies limiting the prohibition contained in this section to a ban on signs alone moreover given the holding of the north dakota supreme court in the case of neumann signs inc v hjelle 268 nw 2d 741 it appears that a prohibition on the erection and maintenance of signs within the untraveled portion of the public rightofway would not unconstitutionally infringe upon whatever property rights the adjoining property owner might enjoy under the hjelle v snyder case 3 concerns for reasonable investmentbacked expectations of profit justify making prospective only the prohibition herein on the placement and maintenance of signs within the untraveled portion of the public rightofway except that a limited degree of retroactivity to  is warranted in order to avoid a rush to erect new signs during the enactment process of this

population of the city or because of the revocation or voluntary surrender of a license or because any of the numerical limitation formulas under section 516 are amended there becomes available for issuance a license under the authority of this chapter and if it appears to the city council that it is reasonably likely that more than one 1 person might be interested in obtaining the license given the then current market demand in the city for licenses of that type the city shall advertise the availability of the license for a reasonable period of time and shall auction the license off openly or written bids to the highest bidder however the successful bidder must qualify under section 518 in order to obtain a license if more than one 1 license of a particular class has been available for

presumption that the market demand for licenses of that class does not exceed the number of licenses of that class available for issuance b a license shall authorize the carrying on of activity pursuant to its authority only with regard to licensed premises at one 1 particular location except to the extent allowed under section 518 however this subsection shall not be construed as prohibiting the periodic expansion and contraction of licensed premises at a particular location as the occasion demands such as when for example a motel licensee dispenses alcoholic beverages at a public assembly room within the motel during a convention or other special activity when otherwise such room is not ordinarily used for the service or consumption of alcoholic beverages c when the city annexes territory which contains an establishment which was licensed by the county to sell alcoholic beverages at retail immediately prior to the annexation the city will issue to its owner a city license to sell alcoholic beverages without regard to subsection a and even though one 1 of the numerical limitations on licensed imposed by section 516 is exceeded or a prior condition or excess licenses under that section is aggravated as a result of the issuance of the license under this section unless the city council lays down a special rule at the time of annexation whereby the new city license shall carry the same restrictions and terms as the old county license the new city license issued under this subsection shall be as similar to the prior county license as may be obtained under the then existing categories of city licenses a license issued under this subsection shall thereafter be counted as one 1 of the licenses subject to the numerical limitation imposed by section 516 so that for example if the issuance of a license under this subsection causes one 1 of the numerical limitations imposed by section 516 to be exceeded the license issued under this subsection will be counted against future population growth in determining when an additional license is available for issuance under the formula set forth in section 516 it is the intent to this subsection that no county licensee shall lose a license to sell alcoholic beverages simply because the licensee is annexed to the city but that city licenses which have county license ancestors over a period of time shall be treated the same as all other licenses for purposes of section 516 numerical limitations this subsection shall apply retroactively as well as prospectively except that as a onetime exception it shall not be construed to bar the issuance of any additional licenses which became available under section 516 after  and before  under the ordinance then in effect reserved adequate parking at the

for in this article under the powers of its home rule charter and particularly the police power of the state of north dakota as invoked by or charter and the constitutional and statutory provisions

constitutions and for that reason the city is not obligated to pay compensation to any private property owner who may be adversely affected by such restrictions nevertheless in the event a court of competent jurisdiction holds otherwise and is sustained upon appeal if any it is the intention of the city that rather than these restrictions being invalidated it instead be allowed to pay a fair and just compensation for whatever compensable damages as may be suffered by private property owners who are adversely affected by these restrictions in other words the city would prefer to settle an inverse condemnation claim or to have such claim adjudicated by the courts instead of allowing the restrictions to be invalidated because they accomplish an uncompensated taking forbidden by law

conduct a regularly carried on activity which may be parttime or which may be seasonal as distinguished from isolated and infrequent transactions occurring only two 2 or three 3 times a year drummer a person who as a part of a course or pattern of conduct solicits orders for goods or services from the ultimate consumer thereof or a person in the household of the ultimate consumer but which person does not himself or agent deliver the goods or perform the services which may be ordered and which person does not ordinarily operate out of a fixed place of business within the city of minot while soliciting orders fixed place of business physical premises used in the course of conducting a retail sales business to which premises the general public is invited for the purpose of examining and purchasing the stock of goods held for sale and at which premises the delivery of the purchased goods to the buyer takes place migrant merchant drummers peddlers or temporary shopkeepers peddler a person who as part of a course or pattern of conduct solicits orders for goods or services from the ultimate consumer thereof or a person in the household of the ultimate consumer which person himself or agent delivers the goods or performs the services for which he obtains orders and which person does not ordinarily operate out of a fixed place of business within the city of minot while soliciting orders temporary shopkeeper a person who solicits orders for goods or services from the ultimate consumer thereof or a person in the household of the ultimate consumer at or out of a fixed place of business within the city of minot irrespective of whether he or his agents delivers the goods or performs the services for which orders are placed however a person shall not be considered a temporary shopkeeper if at the time that he solicits orders for goods or services at a fixed place of business he has a possessory interest in the physical premises which constitute the fixed place of business either by way of a fee simple or by way of a leasehold interest therein which leasehold interest was valid for a minimum term of at least one hundred eighty 180 days at and from the time that the person commenced soliciting orders at the leased premises  legislative findings purpose and intent a the city council of the city of minot finds that it is necessary to regulate certain migrant merchants under the police power of the municipality in order to combat criminal activity or to reduce the opportunity for criminal activity to occur and to protect the citizens as consumers b the city council finds that there is a substantial likelihood that certain criminals or persons who might be tempted to perform criminal acts hold themselves out as bona fide drummers or peddlers for the sole purpose of going door to door in order to case a residence or business premises with an eye towards using the information so gathered to assist in the perpetration of a criminal act if the opportunity presents itself the council further finds that whether or not such activity does take place nevertheless some citizens have a legitimate fear or concern that it may be taking place and that it is appropriate to take reasonable steps to attempt to allay that concern finally the council finds that the citizens of minot who purchase goods or services from a migrant merchant are at a disadvantage in obtaining recourse from the migrant merchant if the goods or services are not delivered as promised or if the goods or services are not as warranted and represented because ordinarily the migrant merchant is not physically present in the city for purposes of making a claim against him or initiating a lawsuit against him when the occasion to do so arises nor is it convenient or easy to locate assets of his subject to the execution of a levy in the event a judgment is obtained against him c consequently it is the purpose and intent of the council by enacting this division to impose certain identification requirements on those persons acting as migrant merchants on the theory that if a person knows that his identification is known to the police he would be less likely to attempt to use the assumed role of being a drummer or peddler as a means of obtaining information helpful in a criminal enterprise likewise it is the intent and purpose of the council to require that migrant merchants post performance bonds in order to assist dissatisfied consumers in pursuing complaints against such persons arising out of the commercial transactions in which they may engage while within the city d the city council realizes that under the commerce clause of the united states constitution there exists limitations on the restrictions which lawfully may be imposed on a drummer who represents enterprises doing business in interstate commerce however it is the opinion and the finding of the council that the restrictions in this division do not constitute an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce because they are applicable to both interstate and intrastate commerce and they apply to residents of north dakota except those domiciled within the city and to residents of other states alike in an impartial manner and because they serve the legitimate governmental interests identified previously however it is the special intent of the council that in the event that a court determines that this division is unconstitutional as applied to some or all transactions in interstate commerce that the general severability provisions of section 14 be applied in such a manner as to uphold the balance of the division e this division is designed to exclude from its purview those migrant merchants who represent wholesalers distributors or manufacturers or the functional equivalent thereof because the council finds that those persons present less of a problem with respect to the concerns identified above and because the persons with whom representatives of wholesalers distributors and manufacturers are likely to deal are more able to and inclined to protect their own interests than is the average consumer f likewise the person who has established a bona fide domicile within the city of minot is excluded from the scope of operation of this division because the council finds that the establishment of ones domicile within the community in view of its relatively permanent status 1 tends to make ones identity known to a number of persons distributed throughout the city so that the purpose otherwise served by requiring an identification license under this division is thereby accomplished  2 tends to offer an impediment to ones removal from the city if one should perpetuate a criminal act thus enhancing the possibility of the police being able to make a successful arrest  3 tends to make it more likely that one will stand behind the goods and services which one sells because the city is relatively small and there exist many social business educational religious political and neighborhood ties and interconnections among the citizens which make the business reputation of a person in business or trade extremely sensitive to and vulnerable to the complaint of even one disgruntled consumer  and 4 tends to make it more likely that ones whereabouts will be discoverable in the event that a lawsuit arising out of a business transaction is necessary g merchants with longterm possessory interests in a fixed place of business within the city are excluded from the operation of this division because it is the finding of the city council that such persons are likely to have made a sizeable investment in their business which means that the chances of such persons being available for service of process with respect to a lawsuit arising out of a business transaction is correspondingly increased as is the chance that a successful plaintiff can collect a judgement against such persons h the council further finds that contribution solicitors present similar problems to those posed by migrant merchants with regard to the ability of a contribution solicitor to obtain information useful to accomplish or to attempt criminal acts and that consequently it is appropriate to require contribution solicitors to obtain a license for identification purposes except for those contribution solicitors who are domiciled within the city which latter class is exempted from the licensing requirement for substantially the same reasons that support the exemption from licensing of those migrant merchants who are domiciled within the city

new ch 20 as herein set out for the derivation of former ch 20 see the table commencing on page ct1 cross reference open receptacles containing alcoholic beverages in vehicles  514  bicycles ch 8  trains and buses blocking streets  296  vehicles for hire ch 30 article i  in general legislative intent and purpose it is of extreme importance to the safety and wellbeing of residents of and visitors to the city of minot that the use of motor vehicles within the city be strictly controlled to preserve persons and property from harm as well as to promote the convenience of drivers and pedestrians alike although the use of motor vehicles is comprehensively regulated in detail by state law nevertheless there is a need for municipal court enforcement of traffic safety regulations moreover the city has special problems with traffic control not specifically addressed in the state law consequently the city council does hereby assert the power and authority granted to it in titles 39 and 40 of the north dakota century order to adopt and enforce the following traffic regulations in so doing it is the legislative intent to parallel the provisions of state law to the maximum extent feasible however all of title 39 of the north dakota century not adopted in its entirety by this city for the following reasons 1 many parts of title 39 pertain to matters of statewide concern which are to be enforced primarily or exclusively by state officials such as by way of illustration the laws pertaining to motor vehicle dealer licensing or vehicle weight regulations with respect to interstate highways 2 some provisions of title 39 constitute a grant of authority to municipalities to regulate certain matters this city may assert such authority under and by virtue of such provisions by enacting the particular restrictions desired without the necessity of also enacting the general language granting such authority an example of such a provision is ndcc 390903 which permits local authorities to set speed limitations on certain streets another example is provided by ndcc 391035 3 which permits the regulation of certain turning movements 3 some provisions of title 39 pertain to municipal court procedure or requirements imposed on the municipal court or on municipal police officers to report certain matters to state officials the city has no power to alter the effect of such provisions and likewise it is a futile gesture to enact a city ordinance requiring what state law already requires particularly in view of the justifiable presumption that the local officials will do their duties examples of such provisions include most of pertaining to hearings on alleged traffic offenses and the decriminalization of traffic offenses and 390817 which requires the municipal court judge to report certain convictions to the state highway commissioner in view of the unworkability of enacting by reference all of title 39 ndcc as part of this ordinances it is the purpose of this chapter of the ordinances to identify and enact into local law for this city those sections of title 39 which define a substantive offense and which are to be enforced on a local level by this city furthermore as explained more fully hereafter such additional parts of title 39 are adopted herein by reference as are required to give meaning to the substantive offenses even

are imposed by this section conflict with those restrictions which are provided for in ndcc 392409 or ndcc 392909 which sections of the north dakota century adopted by reference in section 206 hereof then the provisions of this section shall govern d by public proclamation the mayor or in his absence the president of the city council or in the absence of both the city manager may suspend the

reserved article iii  rules of construction trial procedure and evidence definitions of terms and rules of construction a those portions of title 39 ndcc which are not specifically identified in section 206 hereof as being adopted herein by reference thereto are nevertheless adopted herein by reference to the extent such provisions meet any of the following criteria 1 the provision specifically or by implication defines or gives a technical meaning to any of the terms or words used within the state statute referred to in section 206 an example would be ndcc 390101 setting forth general definitions 2 the provision sets forth a rule of law or other information which gives meaning to the offense described in any of the sections adopted from state law in section 206 or the provision explains how the law may be complied with and the offense avoided for example ndcc 390411 which is adopted by reference thereto in section 206 hereof requires the display of license plates while operating a vehicle upon public highways other provisions of define a license plate explain in detail when one is required set forth the procedure to be followed in obtaining a license etc such other provisions in ndcc and elsewhere in title 39 are hereby adopted to the extent necessary to avoid a claim that the substantive offenses identified and adopted in section 206 standing by themselves and without further explanation or definition are so vague indefinite and uncertain as to be void for vagueness 3 the provision establishes a defense or exception to i any rule of law or ii provision defining an offense set forth in section 206 for example ndcc 390601 which is adopted by reference in section 206 generally requires that the operator of a vehicle on north dakota highways have in his possession a valid north dakota drivers license however ndcc 390602 establishes exceptions to that rule and thus it would be a valid defense to prosecution under 390601 if the defendant could show the courts that he falls within one of the exceptions set forth in 390602 b in addition to the definitions set forth in subsection a of this section the following words are given the following additional meanings 1 central business district shall mean that portion of the city of minot bounded on the west by broadway on the south by 4th avenue south on the east by 3rd street east

vehicle is moved from its original resting place a distance greater than its own length to park is to cause such status or process to come about with respect to any motor vehicle however parking does not include the ordinary stopping of a vehicle within the stream of traffic on the traveled portions of a street which is necessitated by obedience to traffic lights stop signs or in response to the movements of other vehicles and pedestrians and other similar causes 5 the word street when used in this chapter shall be all inclusive of every public throughfare including alleys avenues bridges

limitations or limitations with respect to the types of vehicles permitted upon certain streets shall be enforced until there shall have been erected the trafficcontrol device itself or a sign post so designed and located that it gives a warning to the reasonably observant person of common intelligence of the nature of the restriction to be enforced provided that however the restriction on uturns within the central business district shall apply without sign posting or without the erection of a trafficcontrol device prohibiting uturns likewise section 2022 shall be enforced without prior posting of signs the specific posting provisions of section 20242b shall govern over the foregoing more general provisions of this section      applicability of this chapter to bicycles in addition to

sign states that fines are doubled c the penalty for speeding offenses in which an element of the offense is that the speeding occurred within a given distance of a school shall be as provided for in ndcc 390610612 d except as provided in subsection e the fines imposed in subsection b shall be mandatory and not subject to reduction remission suspension or abatement e when a defendant does not avail himself of the procedures set forth in ndcc or 3906103 when charged with an offense and thereafter the defendant is properly convicted of committing the offense or when a particular penalty provision of state law is not mandatory the municipal court may impose the full range of penalties permitted by section 18 of this as provided in subsection b hereof and in section 2029f f the level of culpability required to sustain a conviction under this chapter of the ordinances shall be that the defendant acted or failed to act knowingly as that term is used in ndcc 1210202b unless the

violation of this chapter proof that a vehicle was operated or parked in a manner constituting a violation of this chapter shall give rise to the rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of

may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary presented by the prosecution in the course of establishing that the offense was in fact committed as when for example a person other than the registered owner is specifically charged with the offense  defenses a any defendant charged with an offense under this of the ordinances may raise as a defense any exception exculpatory rule of evidence or affirmative defense provided in title 39 or elsewhere in the north dakota century to which he would be entitled if the prosecution against him had been brought in state court as opposed to municipal court additionally the defendant may avail himself of any like defense set forth in this chapter of the ordinances b if the defendant raises a defense under subsection a hereof he shall have the initial burden of coming forward with sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case that the affirmative defense exception or exculpatory rule applies c if the defendant complies with subsection b hereof the city prosecutor shall then have the burden of persuasion with respect to the issue of fact raised thereby with such burden being the predominance of the evidence with respect to noncriminal charges and with such burden being evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal charges  secs 20572070  reserved article iv  impoundment of vehicles definitions  rules of interpretation a when used in this article the following terms have the meanings given to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates otherwise 1 city means a the officials and employees of the

on private property that such vehicle except when it is being actively worked on or cannibalized for parts is not readily visible from other nearby private property or from the nearby public right of way a because of the intervention of shrubbery or fences or topography or some combination or all of these  or b because 1 the vehicle is securely covered by an opaque and intact fabric cover which is designed to cover the vehicle to the middle of hubcaps and 2 the vehicle is situated on the property where it is located as far away from the most traveled public right of way abutting such property as is reasonably feasible 6 vehicle means any selfpropelled vehicle b nothing in paragraph 3 of subsection a shall be construed as requiring an extraordinary search of public records or a formal investigation to ascertain an address as opposed to a routine examination of the general indices maintained to provide access to such information c the city may at its discretion treat consent obtained from one owner of a vehicle or real property or notice given to one owner of a vehicle or real property as binding on all other owners of the same vehicle or real property thus for example notice provided to a car leasing company in respect to one of its leased vehicles will be deemed to be notice to the lessee of the vehicle which vehicle is identified in the notice and similarly an as another example notice given to or consent obtained from a tenant of real property shall be deemed notice to or consent from the landlord d when a vehicle which is located upon private property is subject to impoundment under this article and when after the exercise of reasonable diligence it cannot be ascertained who the owner of the vehicle is then it shall be presumed that the vehicle is owned the same as the land upon which it is located e when a period of time specified in this article is expressed in terms of a number of days less than eleven 11 such number shall be calculated by excluding the day of the event triggering the running of such time period such as for example the giving of a notice and by excluding likewise any intervening saturday sunday state holiday or federal holiday any period of days which ends on a saturday sunday state holiday or federal holiday shall be extended to the next following day which is neither a saturday sunday state holiday or federal

interest therein such as a lienholder if at the time of impoundment 1 the physical condition of the vehicle or its location regardless of whether it is on private property or public property and if it is on public property regardless whether it is lawfully parked or stopped thereon or both constitute a serious and immediate danger to the health or safety of any member of the public or to the safety of private or public property  or 2 the vehicle is located on a street highway or other public property and is not lawfully parked or stopped thereon in accordance with this ordinances and its location substantially and seriously interferes with a the normal flow or traffic  b ongoing street cleaning or snow removal operations including the use of a snow removal emergency route for the trucking of snow without regard to where the snow was loaded  c any other ongoing operations performed by municipal employees in the course of their duties  or 3 the vehicle is located upon a street

contemplated by the owner thereof such as for example fire windstorm or flood actual or impending the vehicle or its contents or both are in immediate danger of being damaged destroyed or stolen  4 prior notice would be otherwise required under this article but based upon the facts then known to the city it reasonably appears that such prior notice if given would be ineffectual because the owner is incompetent or incapacitated and after a reasonably diligent search no one can be found who is looking after the interests of the owner  5 prior notice would otherwise be required under this article but the identity of the owner or his lastknown address or both cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained  6 impoundment of the vehicle without prior notice to the owner thereof is otherwise authorized by law such as for example when the vehicle is known or reasonably believed to be the fruit or instrumentality of a crime and because of other circumstances subject to seizure as such without a warrant  7 the vehicle is parked in a noparking immediate towaway zone which zone is properly posted with signs as required by section 2052  8 the vehicle is parked within a fire lane

movement of other parked vehicles  or b within a loading zone beyond the time limitation applicable to the loading zone which loading zones the airport manager is hereby delegated the authority to designate provided that fair warning signs as to the time limitations have been posted b if a vehicle may be impounded under this section without prior notice to the owner thereof then it is immaterial that there may also be ground for impounding the vehicle under section 2073 and this section governs c whenever under the terms of this section the city may take action in respect to a vehicle without the consent of the owner of the vehicle then it is not obligated to provide prior notice of its intentions in that regard to the owner of the vehicle or to any other person having a nonownership interest therein such as for example a lienholder nevertheless at its discretion the city may endeavor to provide prior notice to such persons without however a failure to accomplish such

maximum extent feasible the analysis shall treat the work force of the city as a whole and shall disregard departmental boundaries the purposes of the classification analysis shall be to set forth various categories or classes each of which will consist of a number of job descriptions which are substantially similar to one another in terms of duties responsibilities authority minimum qualifications required skills required knowledge required character traits and such other matters as might be deemed relevant the various categories or classes shall be distinguished from one another to the extent feasible by suitable descriptive titles moreover the various categories or classes shall be arranged in a numerical ranking system which shall take into account and which shall reflect the relative importance difficulty and exclusivity of each category or classification with respect to all other categories or classifications the numerical ranking system shall use consecutive numbers

occupies a higher grade than the first e after the annual plan has been confirmed by the city council with or without modification as provided for in subsection a hereof it shall govern and establish the salaries to be paid to city employees during the fiscal year to which it pertains during that fiscal year no employee shall be paid in excess of the amount provided therein for the position which he occupies however nothing herein is to be construed as prohibiting an increase in pay to an employee resulting from a promotion received by him or attributable to attaining a higher step within a grade as long as the promotion or step increase occurs in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the rules and regulations established hereunder f changes in classification with respect to a particular job description may be initiated by the director as part of the preparation of the annual plan or the process may be initiated at any time by the employee holding the position in question  provided however that in the latter case the reclassification if any shall not take effect until approved by the commission and the city auditor certifies that sufficient unencumbered monies are available in the appropriate accounts in the budget for the fiscal year during which the reclassification occurs to pay for any resulting salary increase reclassification may be based upon either one 1 of two 2 grounds 1 the job description adequately describes the job but the relative ranking of the job is inappropriate when compared to other job descriptions in the same grade 2 the job description does not accurately reflect the knowledge and skills being used by the employee in the course of employment or it does not reflect the duties and responsibility actually being discharged by the employee  and if the job description were rewritten accordingly the job would be ranked at a different grade or the rewritten description would duplicate an existing description at a different grade g instead of granting a request for a reclassification of a position currently occupied by an employee the commission may instead if it deems it in the best interest of the service require of the director that the provisions of this chapter pertaining to promotions lateral transfers or demotions be followed instead including if necessary the declaration of a vacancy with respect to a position and the filling of that position by competitive examination so that the intent and purpose of this chapter may not be frustrated device of administratively reassigning duties in exercising its discretion under this subsection the commission shall consider whether and to what extent the reclassification request comes about as the result of a gradual evolutionary and unanticipated change

amongst themselves alone for the vacancy the commission shall make a determination among such present employees as to who meets the minimum qualifications for the position and pursuant to subsection c

commission shall submit to the appointing authority a list of names of present employees eligible for appointment to the vacancy in so doing it shall employ the formula set forth in subsection d of section 2442 in order to establish how many names to the list and shall list the names in accordance with their order of comparative ranking the highest first the appointing authority may fill the vacancy from the list or it may reject all names thereon if more than one vacancy is involved the appointing authority may fill one or more vacancies from the list and yet retain the right to reject the remaining names thereon with respect to the remaining vacancies if pursuant to this paragraph a present employee who bids for a vacant position is not selected for that position he may nevertheless compete for the same position with the applicants who compete for the position pursuant to section 2442 assuming that the position is not filled by another present employee or by the rehiring of a former employee but in that instance he is entitled to no special preference by virtue of being a present city employee 2 paragraph 1 shall not apply to those positions identified by the commission as entrance level positions nor to department head positions so that consequently city employees and nonemployees alike may apply for such positions on an equal footing 3 to the extent a vacancy is to be filled from among present employees preference shall be given to demotions over lateral transfers and to lateral transfers over promotions if the vacancy is to be filed by a demotion the following descending order of preference shall be observed demotions as part of a reduction in force demotions for the good of the service demotion of a probationary employee and voluntary demotions if the vacancy is to be filled by a lateral transfer the following descending order of preference will be observed lateral transfer as a part of a reduction in force lateral transfer for the good of the service lateral transfer of a probationary employee voluntary lateral transfer and lateral transfer for disciplinary reasons 4 notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraphs 1 and 2 above the appointing authority must fill a vacancy by demotion or lateral transfer if that action is required by section 2450 pertaining to reduction in force or if an applicant seeks a voluntary demotion or voluntary transfer to a position when no one with higher priority under this subsection seeks the same position and all affected department heads consent c the commission shall promulgate suitable regulations rules and procedures to implement the system of priorities set forth in subsection b these regulations shall also set forth a means whereby comparative rankings can be established among employees in the same category who are eligible for a vacant position such as for example when more than one employee is seeking a lateral transfer to a vacancy the comparative ranking system shall take into account each employees performance evaluations and length of service and may take into account the results of tests or criteria similar to those provided for in section 2442c d if a vacancy is filled by the rehiring of a former employee or the hiring of a new employee the procedures set forth in sections 2443 and 2442 respectively shall be followed e in all cases where a vacancy becomes available for filling the director shall see that suitable public notice of the vacancy is given the notice will include the title of the position if any the job description for the position which may be summarized the classification of and the minimum and maximum salary attributable to the position and appropriate information as to how an interested applicant may obtain further particulars the public notice shall be made in the manner most reasonable under the circumstances for example if it appears to the director that it is very likely that the position will be filled by a present city employee then at least initially the notice need only be posted on city bulletin boards and distributed among city employees without publication of the notice in a newspaper of general circulation    hiring new employees a if a vacancy in the service is not filled by a present employee or by the rehiring of an employee who is eligible for rehiring as a matter of right then the appointing authority may choose an employee from among names of applicants submitted to him by the director in accordance with the following procedures or he may choose to leave the position vacant b the appointing authority shall indicate to the director whether he wishes to choose an employee from the existing eligibility list established with respect to the position if any or whether he wishes the director to create a new eligibility list for that position c an eligibility list shall be established with respect to a position as follows the commission will establish and approve appropriate tests and criteria to be used to evaluate employment applicants with respect to each position based upon the contents of the job description pertaining thereto including specifically the minimum qualifications stated therein the tests may be written oral physical or in the form of a demonstration of skill or any combination of these the tests and criteria shall be designed to evaluate elements of training experience aptitude knowledge character personality skill physical fitness or other qualifications in any event the tests and criteria to be administered must be reasonably designed to relate positively to actual job performance with respect to the position for which the tests are given and the criteria applied in order that the tests shall not serve as a means whereby job applicants are unlawfully discriminated against on the grounds of race color religion sex age or national origin d the commission shall rank applicants one against the other based upon the results of the tests referred to in subsection c and the list of the names of the applicants set forth in the order of their respective rankings with the highest ranked first shall constitute the eligibility list for the position for which the tests were administered the appointing authority may consider for appointment three 3 names on the list for the first vacancy to be filled plus two 2 names for each vacancy thereafter but the names subject to consideration for appointment must be selected in consecutive numerical order commencing with the first e the commission may provide with respect to certain classes of positions that no tests of the type provided for in subsection c be administered as when for example the position requires as a prerequisite that the applicant possess a professional degree or professional credentials likewise the commission may provide that certain positions be filled by the appointing authority on the basis of personal interviews only because the nature of the position does not easily permit the applicant to be evaluated in an objective manner but rather selection must take into account intangible aspects of character and personality f if in the judgement of the commission it will promote the efficiency of the service to maintain permanent eligibility lists with respect to some positions it may do so without prejudice however to the right of the appointing authority at any time to require that a new eligibility list be established with respect to a position wherein there is a vacancy which the appointing authority wishes to fill the permanent eligibility list may either be frozen or floating that is a frozen list is one to which no new names are added until some predetermined event occurs such as the number of the names on the list dropping to a certain prescribed level or after the passage of a prescribed period of time a floating list is one in which names are added and ranked from time to time as persons submit applications for employment and take examinations which procedure the commission may authorize even though no vacancies may exist in the positions for which employment is sought if the commission does establish a permanent eligibility list it may strike names therefrom at any time upon its determination that good cause exists to do so the nature of such good cause shall be established by the commission by appropriate rules and regulations but at a minimum these rules and regulations will provide that the name of a person on a permanent eligibility list shall be struck if that person 1 obtains city employment 2 refuses an offer of city employment 3 can no longer be contacted after a reasonably diligent effort to do so 4 can no longer meet minimum qualifications for the position to which the list refers 5 requests elimination from the list or g the director shall have the authority to prescribe the contents of job application forms as part of the initial job application process he may make a determination whether the applicant meets certain minimum employment standards which by way of rules and regulations established by the commission shall be imposed upon all job applicants irrespective of the position applied for the minimum employment standards may include by way of example a requirement that the applicant be literate in the english language or that the applicant shall never have been convicted of a felony however such standards must be reasonably job related so that they do not serve as a means of unlawful discrimination against job applicants on the grounds of race color religion sex age or national origin an applicant who cannot meet all the minimum employment standards shall not be considered further for employment nor shall he be permitted to take employment tests with respect to a position until such time as he can meet the minimum employment standards h any person not an employee of the city may appeal to the commission from a decision made under the authority of this section by the director or by the appointing authority which decision is adverse to the party making the appeal or which is otherwise claimed to prejudice him    reemployment the director shall maintain a register of employees who are entitled to reemployment as a matter of right comprised of those persons who were discharged from city employment solely on the basis of a reduction in force the register shall set forth the position which each employee thereon last held thereafter the director shall recall to employment persons whose names appear on the list as appropriate vacancies occur the commission shall by rules and regulations established by it determine the order in which employees shall be recalled to employment which rules and regulations may be based upon respective performance evaluations respective lengths of service respective dates of discharge or any combination of these an employee who is eligible for recall as a matter of right shall not be recalled to fill a vacancy if a present employee of the city who is afforded preference to the position under 2441 b is willing to fill the position the commission by rules and regulations may provide for the removal of names from the reemployment register in the same manner and for the same reasons that names are removed from an eligibility list    veterans preference a any applicant for a position who is a veteran of the armed forces to the united states who was not dishonorably discharged therefrom and who served in such forces during a period of war shall have five 5 points added to his test results provided for in 2441c or 2442c unless he is disabled by a serviceconnected disability in which case he shall have ten 10 points added to the test results b period of war means any of those time periods specified in ndcc 370140    nondiscrimination it is the policy of this city not to discriminate unlawfully against any person in regard to employment on the grounds of race color religion sex age or national origin  special appointments a not withstanding anything in sections 2441 to the contrary the appointing authority exercising his sole authority alone may hire a person to fill a vacancy in any position as long as he does so subject to the limitations set forth in the following subsections b a person may be hired to fill a vacancy in any position as a provisional employee that is for a period of time consisting of not more than ninety 90 consecutive days no person shall be hired as a provisional employee more than twice with respect to the same position c a person may be hired as a noncareer employee to fill a vacancy in a position which is specifically identified and approved by the city council in the budget as being a noncareer position d nothing in

in force  3 the action is required in order to provide a vacant position for another employee to fill who is being demoted for the good of the service or who is being demoted under this section  4 the employee fails a required postemployment physical examination  or 5 there exists with respect to the probationary employee sufficient grounds which would warrant the dismissal or lateral transfer of

dismissal demotion or lateral transfer the affected employee has the right to request that the commission consider the matter anew at a hearing held for that purpose at such hearing the appointing authority will have the burden with going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion with respect to whether there are adequate grounds for dismissal lateral transfer or demotion under
