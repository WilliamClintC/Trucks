that 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 crime statistics show that all types of crimes especially sexrelated crimes occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located see eg studies of the cities of phoenix arizona  indianapolis indiana  and austin texas 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows see eg

and from an infected mother to her newborn 12 according to the best scientific evidence available aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts see eg findings of the us department of health and human services centers for disease control and prevention 13 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities see eg final report of the attorney generals commission on pornography 1986 at 377 14 numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids including semen and urine are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adultoriented films see eg final report of the attorney generals commission on pornography 1986 at 377 15 nude

establishments increases the likelihood of drug dealing and drug use see eg kev inc v kitsap county 793 f2d 105 1056 9th cir 1986 17 the findings noted in paragraphs numbered 1 16 raise substantial governmental concerns 18 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  1431 general

coinoperated slugoperated or for any form of consideration or electronically electrically or mechanically controlled still or motionpicture machines projectors video or laser disc players or other imageproducing 19 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 20 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this chapter 24 the barring of such individuals from operation or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of 10 years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of this township will be promoted by the enactment of chapter  1431
