cans etching acid or other marking devices used in connection with writing graffiti on walls public and private buildings statues monuments and other structures has become a major problem in the town of islip requiring serious punishment for the perpetrators the unabated proliferation of graffiti is a physical blight upon the landscape of the town and is destroying the aesthetic qualities of its communities the defacing of such public property and the use of foul language in graffiti writing is harmful to the general public and is violative of the good and welfare of the people of the town of islip the town of islip has seen an increase in the use of graffiti used by gangs to intimidate instill fear and harm others within our community any persons using graffiti to specifically intimidate and instill fear on others based on their race color religion disability sexual orientation national origin or ancestry will not be tolerated within the town of islip therefore town board intervention is necessary and advisable to regulate the distribution and sale of aerosol cans and similar products used in writing graffiti punishment by fine or imprisonment insofar as offenders are concerned has failed to stop this type of vandalism it is the intent of the town board that any person guilty of writing graffiti on public or private buildings or structures should be punished so that the punishment shall fit the crime the town board accordingly recommends to the judiciary when an offender has been convicted of violating this chapter that he be sentenced to remove graffiti under the supervision of those agencies designated by the judiciary to supervise offenders sentenced to community service in addition to any other penalty provided by this chapter b the town board further finds based upon past experience that such defacement of property is most often committed by persons under 18 years of age using aerosol spray paint cans broadtipped indelible markers and etching acid  that such persons rarely have a legitimate need for such aerosol cans markers or etching acid  that where such a need exists such aerosol cans markers or etching acid may be furnished by a parent or

otherwise known as fire island is of paramount importance to the citizens of the town of islip although referred to as an island it is in reality a barrier sandbar approximately 31 miles long and only 200 yards to 12 mile wide this barrier sandbar is the only buffer between the atlantic ocean and the south shore of long island the barrier beach not only protects the south shore of long island but by its existence creates the great south bay whose unique ecological characteristics make it one of the prime hard clam and oyster producing areas in the world the harvesting of these clams and oysters is a major industry within the town finally the preservation of the unique character of the barrier beach in the center of the densest metropolitan area in the united states is of paramount

enhancing the community identity of the various hamlets which comprise the town of islip major elements of this identity involve the residential uses architecture and streetscape which have traditionally developed along the major roadways and which serve as scenic gateway to the business districts of these communities b the town board also finds that redevelopment of these properties under the existing business zoning would undermine these elements by the elimination or significant modification to the residential structure replacement of front lawn and vegetation by parking commercial driveways and signage all of which would destroy the present visual quality of these gateways the resulting advance of strip commercial development also undermines the unique functional and visual role these business districts play in preserving community identity such development would add a significant amount of traffic along roadways which are already congested thereby reducing service and safety c it is the intent of the town board to create a zoning district which would be an economically viable alternative to the existing designation but which would not result in the

handheld incident light meters full cutoff fco  a classification for a luminaire designed and installed where no light is emitted at or above a horizontal plane running lowest point on the luminaire in addition the luminous intensity as measured in candelas emitted at any angle from 80 up to 90 cannot exceed a numerical value equal to 10% of the lumen rating of the lamp as reported in a photometric report from the manufacturer as produced by an independent lab a cutoff or semicutoff design allows a restricted amount of light emitted above the horizontal and a noncutoff provides no restriction against light emitted above the horizontal fully shielded  a luminaire constructed lamped and installed in such a manner that all light emitted by it either directly from the lamp or a

rate listed in the table for the use that is most similar to the proposed use these rates reflect a reduced parking demand because of the decreased motor vehicle tripmaking associated with the availability of public transportation serving the psprd  and 2 add together the parking spaces required for each of the component uses to obtain the aggregate number of parking spaces required for all proposed uses e no parking shall be required for the following uses if the commissioner of the department of planning and development or the planning board determines they are accessory to a primary
