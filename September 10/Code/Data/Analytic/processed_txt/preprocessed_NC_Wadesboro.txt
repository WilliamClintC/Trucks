of time industrial dischargers which discharge hydraulic volumes equal to or greater than 15 percent of the treatment works design capacity may be required to provide flow equalization facilities designed in accordance with the current edition of epa process manual for upgrading existing wastewater treatment plants b users in industrial categories subject to effluent guidelines issued under b of the federal act which are discharging incompatible pollutants to publicly owned treatment works are required to adopt best practicable control technology currently available as defined by the administrator pursuant to b of the federal act where the countys treatment works was designed to and does achieve substantial removal of pollutants other than the four pollutants listed in the definition for compatible pollutants in section 36102 bod tss ph and fecal coliform bacteria the approving authority may not require the user to achieve best practicable control technology currently available since this would lead to an uneconomical duplication of treatment facilities while the term substantial removal is not subject to precise definition it generally contemplates removals in the order of 80 percent or greater  minor incidental removals in the order of ten percent to 30 percent are not considered substantial for some industrial categories it may be necessary to define pretreatment guidelines for problems that may arise as a result of the discharge into the countys treatment works however any adjustments required for particular industrial categories should be considered in connection with the countys requirements rather than in the national pretreatment standard in no case shall any user be allowed to exceed the limits stated in subsection a1 of this section limitations on wastewater strength in this division may be supplemented with more stringent limitations pursuant to section 36146 if the town determines that the limitations in this section

subsection 36154a 82 monitoring facilities a users who propose to discharge or who in the judgment of the approving authority likely could discharge wastewater with constituents and characteristics different from that produced by a domestic premises may be required to install a monitoring facility b when more than one user can discharge into a common building sewer the approving authority may require installation of a separate monitoring facility for each user also when in the judgment of the approving authority there is a significant difference in the wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user the approving authority may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate discharge c monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed operated and maintained by the user at the users expense the purpose of the facility is to enable inspection sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced by a user if sampling or metering equipment is required by the town it shall be provided installed and operated at the users expense the monitoring facility will

offices of the town all industries using the countys treatment works are subject to industrial waste surcharges on discharges the characteristics of which exceed the limits set in subsection c of this section for certain pollutants b types of charges and fees the charges and fees as established in the towns schedules of charges and fees may include but not be limited to 1 user classification charges 2 fees for extra monitoring  ie that which requires costs above the average cost of assessing an average or representative analysis 3 fees for permit applications include regular monitor charges on permit 4 appeal fees 5 charges and fees based on wastewater constituents and characteristics 6 ad valorem tax 7 industrial waste surcharges 8 user charge payments c basis for determination of surcharges 1 charges and fees shall be based upon a minimum basic charge for each premises computed on the basis of wastewater from a domestic premises with the following characteristics bod  250 mgl tss  250 mgl oil and grease total  40 mgl cod  625 mgl ammonia nitrogen  15 mgl 2 the charges and fees established for permit users shall be based upon the measured or estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater discharge of that user which may include but not be limited to bod cod ammonia oil and grease chlorine demand and volume d method of determining surcharges the charges for excesses of the constituents listed in subsection c of this section will be based upon the mass emission rate of those constituents and determined as follows 1 mass emission rate mer o   mg  c  834 where mer is the mass emission rate in pounds of a particular constituent mg is the millions of gallons of wastewater discharged and c is the concentration in mgl of the particular constituency being charged for as an example bod cod etc and 834 is equal to the number of poundsone gallon of water 2 the amount of the charge in dollars will be calculated as follows ao  r  mer o where ao is equal to the amount of the charge in dollars and r is equal to the rate of charge per pound of constituent and mer o is equal to the pounds of a constituent an example of surcharge x corporation is a producer of canned foods they discharged 1000000 gallons of wastewater in the month of january analysis found that the wastewater had the following characteristics bod  400 mgl  tss  950 mgl there were no other limitations exceeded in this example there were 100 employees employed at the cannery the limits of bod and tss are 250 mgl the mer of bod is equal to merbod   400250 x 834 x 1 mg   150 x 834 x 1   1251 lbs of bod or  thousand lbs bod if the charge for bod is r  $70001000 lbs bod then the total charge for bod is equal to as ao  r  mer ao  $7000 x  ao $7847 for tss the charge would be computed as follows mertss  950250  834  img   700  834  1   5838 lbs tss or  thousand lbs tss at a charge of $7000thousand lbs the charge for tss    $7000   $40866 total surcharge for january   bod charge  $7847   tss charge  $37866   the higher charge which   $37866 3 where a single discharge is such that more than one constituent is excessive and subject to surcharge the actual surcharge will be based on the most costly constituent rather than on the total of excessive constituents e method of determining charge rates 1 the county council will annually review the actual cost of operation and maintenance of the countys wastewater treatment plant and adjust the surcharge rates and the volume user charge rate per 1000 gallons to reflect the true cost of constituent treatment the adjustments if any will become effective following the first day of each new fiscal year the town council may review these rates and adjust the towns rates accordingly at any time it deems adjustments are in the best interest of the town 2 the town council sets the following rates effective from the date of the ordinance from which this division is derived cod $ ____________ per 1000 pounds in excess of 625 mgl bod 5 $ ____________ per 1000 pounds in excess of 250 mgl tss $ ____________ per 1000 pounds in excess of 250 mgl total oil and grease $ ____________ per 1000 pounds in excess of 40 mgl f sampling procedures and analysis 1 all samples and determinations of wastewater characteristics shall be as representative of the waste discharge as possible the costs of regular sampling and analysis will be included in the permit of class type the town may take additional samples after a significant process change which significantly affects the quantity of strength of the wastewater discharged the frequency of sampling shall be as follows daily average flow thousand gallons per day minimum required frequency of tests for surcharge parameters 010 01 per year 1020 1 per year 2030 1 per six months 3040 1 per three months 4050 1 per month over 50 2 per month  more frequent sampling may be done at any time at the option of the town for any industry where pretreatment is required or that has discharged incompatible wastes in the past 2 upon request by the person concerned the town shall make available split samples of the composite sample collected if the person feels the results are not representative of their wastes the town may resample at a cost to the person per day in the amount as provided in the town schedule of fees and charges which will include sampling and analysis for bod tss cod ph chlorine demand and oil and grease or heavy metals if necessary g sampling small industries small industries with inadequate sampling facilities may in the event that waste characteristics do not vary more than 25 percent be charged an estimated or average surcharge for that industry 89 enforcement a duties of user upon unlawful discharges 1 any user who discharges
