council have on numerous occasions and with increasing frequency been confronted with requests to site communications towers and antennas the purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting of towers and antennas the goals of this ordinance are to i encourage the location of towers on public property and in nonresidential areas and to minimize the total number of towers throughout the city ii encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites iii encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal iv encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas and v enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services throughout the city quickly effectively and efficiently accordingly the city council finds that the promulgation of this ordinance is warranted and necessary 1to manage the location of towers and antennas in the city and encourage the use of public property for the placement thereof  2to protect residential areas and land users from potential adverse impacts of towers including support structure failure and falling ice  3to minimize adverse visual impacts of towers design siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  4to accommodate the growing need for towers  5to promote and encourage shared usecolocation of existing and new towers as a primary option rather than construction of additional single use towers and to reduce the number of such structures needed in the future 6to consider the public health and safety of towers to the extent allowed by the telecommunications act of 199 7to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from antenna support structure failure and falling ice proper siting of antenna support structure new uses all towers existing on the date of passage of this ordinance shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist routine maintenance shall be permitted on such existing towers new construction other than routine maintenance on existing towers shall comply with the requirements of this ordinance adopted 2000  industry site selection criteria in siting a new site the industry requires a location that is technically compatible with the established network general area is to be identified based upon engineering constraints and the desired area of service specific locations within that general area will be evaluated using the following criteria which are not listed in order of priority 1topography as it relates to line of site transmissions for optimum efficiency in telephone service 2availability of road access 3availability of electric power 4availability of land based telephone lines or microwave link capability 5leasable lands and landlords who want facilities to be located on their properties consistent with zoning regulations 6screening potential of existing vegetation structures and topographic features 7zoning that will allow low power mobile radio service facilities 8compatibility with adjacent land users 9the least number of sites to cover the desired area 10the greatest amount of coverage consistent with physical requirements 11opportunities to mitigate possible visual impact 12availability of suitable existing structures for antenna mounting adopted 2000  city site selection criteria as a fundamental element of this chapter the telecommunications company proposing to construct an antenna support structure or mount an antenna on an existing structure is required to demonstrate using technological evidence that the antenna must go where it is proposed in order to satisfy its function in the companys grid system further the company must demonstrate by technological evidence that the height requested is the minimum height necessary to fulfill the cell sites function within the grid system applications for necessary permits will only be processed when the applicant demonstrates that it is either an fcc licensed telecommunications provider or has in place agreements with an fcc licensed telecommunications provider for use or lease of the support structure low power mobile radio service facilities should be located and designed to minimize any adverse effect that they may have on residential property values sites should be placed in locations where the existing topography vegetation buildings or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening sites should be located on bare ground without visual mitigation only in districts zoned cg li mu hi and r and b based on the design standards articulated in this chapter location and design of sites in all districts should consider the impact of the site on the surrounding neighborhood and the visual impact within the zone district in residential districts and residential land use areas the minimum lot size for commercial communications towers shall be three acres adopted 2000  priorities 1the following establishes the order of priorities for locating new communications facilities aplace antennas on appropriate existing structures such as buildings communications towers water towers and smokestacks in appropriately zoned districts bplace antennas and stealth towers on city property in the li and hi and cg zone a private property owner who leases space for a telecommunication tower is the only one who receives compensation even though numerous other property owners in the area and the citizenry in general are adversely affected requiring all telecommunication towers to be located on government property with all lease payments being paid to lindon city instead of individual property owners evenly distributes the income from the lease payments to all the citizens of lindon government services thus indirectly compensating all of the citizens of lindon for the impact all citizens experience the public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of telecommunication towers and to mitigate their impact can best be facilitated by requiring the location of telecommunication and antenna support structures on property owned leased or used by lindon city as a highest priority whenever feasible the city council may waive the requirements of this subsection to allow antennas and towers to be placed on school district property if based on technological or engineering data provided by the applicant the city council determines the location of telecommunication towers or antenna support structures on city or school district property is not feasible or practicable as required by this subsection then the priorities set forth in the following subsections c shall apply cplace antennas and towers on city property or at the discretion of the city council on school district property in the mu and r&b zones dplace antennas and towers on other private nonresidential property eplace antennas and towers in other residential districts only if locations for which a need has been demonstrated are not available on existing structures or in nonresidential districts and only on or in existing churches parks utility facilities or other public facilities an applicant for a new antenna support structure to be located in a residential zoning district shall demonstrate that a diligent effort has been made to locate the proposed communications facilities on a government structure a private institutional structure or other appropriate existing structures within a nonresidential zoning district and that due to valid considerations including physical constraints and economic or technological feasibility no appropriate location is available the telecommunications company is required to demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures within a one mile radius of the site proposed asked for permission to install the antenna on those locations and was denied for reasons other than economic ones the information submitted by the applicant shall include a map of the area to be served by the tower its relationship to other antenna sites in the applicants network and an evaluation of existing buildings taller than twenty feet communications towers and water tanks within one mile of the proposed tower 2priority of userspriority for the use of cityowned land for antennas and towers will be given to the following entities in descending order alindon city  bpublic safety agencies including law enforcement fire and ambulance services which are not part of lindon city such as the pleasant grove police department and private entities with a public safety agreement with lindon city  cother governmental agencies for uses which are not related to public safety  and dentities providing licensed commercial wireless telecommunication services including cellular personal communications services pcs specialized mobilized radio smr enhanced specialized mobilized radio esmr paging and similar services marketed to the general public 3minimum requirementsthe placement of antennas or towers on cityowned property must comply with the following requirements athe antennas or tower will not interfere with the purpose for which the cityowned property is intended bthe antennas or tower will have no adverse impact on surrounding private property therefore all new towers that are constructed shall be stealth towers cthe applicant is willing to obtain adequate liability insurance and commit to a lease agreement which includes equitable compensation for the use of public land and other necessary provisions and safeguards the fees shall be established by the city council after considering comparable rates in other cities potential expenses risks to the city and other appropriate factors dthe applicant will submit a letter of credit performance bond or other security acceptable to the city to cover the costs of antenna or tower removal ethe antennas or tower will not interfere with other users who have a higher priority as discussed in 1 fremoval may be required by the city the terms and conditions of which will be determined on a lease by lease basis gthe applicant must reimburse the city for any costs which it incurs because of the presence of the applicants antennas or tower hthe user must obtain all necessary land use approvals and ithe applicant will cooperate with the citys objective to promote colocations and thus limit the number of separate antenna sites requested 4special requirementsthe use of certain cityowned property such as water tower sites and parks for antennas or towers brings with it special concerns due to the unique nature of these sites the placement of antennas or towers on these special cityowned sites will be allowed only when the following additional requirements are met awater tower or reservoir sites  the citys water towers and reservoirs represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak capacity reserves protection of the quality of the citys water supply is of prime importance to the city as access to the citys water storage systems increases so too increases the potential for contamination of the public water supply for these reasons the placement of antennas or towers on water tower or reservoir sites will be allowed only when the city is fully satisfied that the following requirements are met ithe applicants access to the facility will not increase the risks of contamination to the citys water supply  iithere is sufficient room on the structure andor on the grounds to accommodate the applicants facility iiithe presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or reservoir maintenance cost to the city  and iv the presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health of workers maintaining the water tower or reservoir bparks  the presence of certain antennas and towers represent a potential conflict with the purpose of some cityowned parks in no case shall towers be allowed in designated conservation areas unless they are to be installed in areas which currently contain tower facilities antennas or towers will be considered only in the following parks after the recommendation of the parks recreation and arts commission and approval of the city council ipublic parks of a sufficient scale and character that are adjacent to an existing commercial or industrial use  iicommercial recreation areas and major play fields  and iii park maintenance facilities 5application process all applicants who wish to locate an antenna or tower on cityowned property must submit to the city manager a completed application and detailed plan that complies with the submittal requirements of this chapter the zoning ordinance subdivision ordinance comprehensive master plan and other regulations and ordinances of the city along with other pertinent information requested by the city the applicant must also apply for a conditional use permit all applications for conditional use permits require council review 6termination the city council may terminate any lease if it determines that any one of the following conditions exist aa potential user with a higher priority cannot find another adequate location and the potential use would be incompatible with the existing use  ba users frequency broadcast unreasonably interferes with other users of higher priority regardless of whether or not this interference was adequately predicted in the technical analysis or ca user violates any of the standards in this ordinance or the conditions attached to the citys lease or other authorization before taking any action the city will provide notice to the user of the intended termination and the reasons for it and provide opportunity for the user to address the city council regarding the proposed action this procedure need not be followed in emergency situations 7reservation of right notwithstanding the above the city council reserves the right to deny for any reason the use of any or all cityowned property by any one or all applicants amended 2002  amended 2000  colocation use of public property to minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation of towers colocation of antennas by more than one 1 carrier on existing or new towers and location of such antennas on public property shall take precedent over the construction of new singleuse towers as indicated below 1proposed antennas may and are encouraged to colocate onto existing towers provided such colocation is accomplished in a manner consistent with the policy site criteria and landscapescreening provisions contained in this chapter then such colocations are permitted by right and new or additional special use approval is not required except that any permit license lease or franchise requirements must be satisfied 2the conditional use requirement for an antenna may be waived in nonresidential zones if the applicant locates the antenna on an existing structure other than an existing tower and or if the antenna is proposed to be located on suitable public property such as a water tower government building or other public tower or pole suitability of public property shall be determined in the citys sole discretion the applicant must submit detailed plans to the planning department for an administrative review to determine if the conditional use permit process and public hearing can be waived no building permit will be issued until approval is granted administrative review 3the city may deny the application to construct a new tower if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an existing structure andor public property 4in order to reduce the number of antenna support structures needed in the city in the future any new proposed support structure shall be designed to accommodate antenna for more than one 1 user unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic technical or physical reasons 5unless colocation has been demonstrated to be infeasible the site plan shall delineate an area near the base of the tower to be used for the placement of additional equipment buildings for other users the site plan for towers in excess of one hundred 100 feet must propose space for two 2 comparable tower users while the site plan for towers under one hundred 100 feet must propose space for one 1 comparable tower user to provide further incentive for colocation as a primary option an existing tower may be modified or reconstructed to accommodate the colocation of an additional antenna provided the additional antenna shall be of the same type as that on the existing tower this is permitted by right for existing towers in all zoning districts subject to the following criteria being met aheight an existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height not to exceed twenty 20 feet over the towers existing height to accommodate the colocation of an additional antenna the height change may occur only once per tower bonsite location a tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the colocation of an additional antenna may be moved onsite within fifty 50 feet of its existing location so long as it remains within the same zone and complies with the other provisions of this chapter after the tower is rebuilt to accommodate colocation only one 1 tower may remain on site adopted 2000  design criteria 1as provided above new towers shall be designed to accommodate antenna for more than one 1 user unless the applicant demonstrates why such design is not feasible for economic technical or physical reasons 2facilities should be architecturally compatible with the surrounding buildings and land uses in the zoning district or otherwise integrated design to blend in with the existing characteristics of the site to the extent practical therefore all new towers that are constructed shall be stealth towers unless the applicant justifies to the council in its sole discretion that a stealth tower is not technically feasible asetback tower setbacks shall be measured from the base of the tower to the property line of the parcel on which it is located unless there are unusual geographical limitations as determined in the citys sole discretion in residential districts and residential land use areas where permitted towers shall be set back from all property lines a distance equal to three hundred percent 300% of tower height as measured from ground level towers shall comply with the minimum setback requirements of the area in which they are located in all other zoning districts bcolor towers shall have a color generally matching the surroundings or background that minimizes their visibility and must be approved by the city unless a different color is required by fcc or faa clights signals and signs no signals lights or signs shall be permitted on towers unless required by the fcc or faa should lighting be required at the time of construction of the tower in cases where there are residential users located within a distance which is three hundred percent 300% of the height of the tower from the tower then approval of dual mode lighting shall be requested from the faa dequipment structures ground level equipment and buildings and the tower base shall be screened from public streets and residentially zoned properties the standards for the equipment and buildings are as follows ithe maximum floor area is three hundred 300 feet and the maximum height is twelve 12 feet iiground level buildings shall be screened from adjacent properties by landscape plantings fencing or other appropriate means as specified herein or in the city equipment buildings mounted on a roof shall have a finish similar to the exterior building walls equipment for roof mounted antenna may also be located within the building on which the antenna is mounted equipment buildings antenna and related equipment shall occupy no more than twentyfive percent 25% of the total roof area of a building antenna or equipment buildings not meeting these standards require a special exception the use must be approved on a comprehensive sketch plan or final development plan as applicable 3federal requirements all towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the faa the fcc and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas if such standards and regulations are changed then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this chapter shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within three 3 months of the effective date of such standards and regulations unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antenna at the owners expense 4building   safety standards to ensure the structural integrity of towers the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards in applicable city building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the electronics industries association eia as amended from time to time if upon inspection the city concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower the owner shall have thirty 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards if the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within the thirty 30 days the city may remove the tower at the owners expense 5structural design towers shall be constructed to the eia standards which may be amended from time to time and all applicable construction or building codes further any improvements or additions to existing towers shall require submission of site plans stamped and verified by a professional engineer which demonstrate compliance with eia standards and all other good industry practices in effect at the time of said improvement or addition the plans shall be submitted to and reviewed at the

shall be constructed painted or fully screened to match as closely as possible the color and texture of the building and wall on which it is mounted dthe antenna may be attached to an existing conforming mechanical equipment enclosure which projects above the roof of the building but may not project any higher than the enclosure eif an accessory equipment shelter is present it must blend with the surrounding buildings in architectural character and color fthe structure must be architecturally and visually color size bulk compatible with surrounding existing buildings structures and vegetation or uses or those likely to exist under the terms of the underlying zoning such facilities will be considered architecturally and visually compatible if they are camouflaged to disguise the facility gsite location and development shall preserve the preexisting character of the site as much as possible existing vegetation should be preserved or improved and disturbance of the existing topography of the site should be minimized unless such disturbance would result in less visual impact of the site on the surrounding area the effectiveness of visual mitigation techniques must be evaluated by city in citys sole discretion taking into consideration the site as built hon buildings thirty 30 feet or less in height the antenna may be mounted on the roof if the following conditions are satisfied ithe city finds that it is not technically possible or aesthetically desirable to mount the antenna on a wall iino portion of the antenna or base station causes the height of the

code kno antenna owner or lessee or officer or employee thereof shall fail to cooperate in good faith to accommodate other competitors in their attempts to use the same building for other antennas if a dispute arises about the feasibility of accommodating another competitor the city administrator may require a third party technical study at the expense of either or both parties to resolve the dispute lno antenna owner or lessee shall fail to assure that the antenna complies at all times with the then current applicable american national standards institute or fcc standards whichever is more stringent after installation but prior to putting the antenna in service each antenna owner shall provide a certification by an independent professional engineer to that effect mno antenna shall

dissemination of ideas commercial residential solicitation generally entails a higher incidence of consumer fraud and unfair sales practices than political religious or other noncommercial doortodoor solicitation involving the dissemination of ideas substantial numbers of city residents do not desire to listen to or otherwise receive commercial solicitations additionally some residents are particularly vulnerable to consumer fraud and unfair consumer sales practices by commercial residential solicitors 5as highlighted by recent serious crimes perpetrated in an adjoining municipality by a doortodoor solicitor the transient nature of the business of residential solicitation makes it difficult to prosecute or to obtain redress for intrusions upon residential privacy and fraudulent or otherwise unfair consumer sales practices by residential solicitors because such solicitors are typically nonresidents of the city and often leave the city immediately upon completion of their commercial solicitation in the city furthermore many companies that employ residential solicitors do not conduct accurate thorough and timely criminal background checks on prospective solicitors

tactics in an effort to complete an economic transaction commercial residential solicitation entails a heightened risk of intrusion upon residential privacy consumer fraud and unfair consumer sales practices albeit by a minority of those engaged in this business the city wishes to reassure residents to the extent reasonably possible and consistent with the first amendment that the residential commercial solicitors who work within the city have not been the subject of criminal actions consumer protection actions or other legal orders or actions reasonably related to the risk of such solicitors intruding upon residential privacy or committing consumer fraud or other unfair consumer sales practices by instituting a residential solicitation registration procedure 7the council finds that the potential and actual harm to citizens from residential solicitation is real and that the provisions hereinafter set forth will to a material degree alleviate and avoid such harm the council has determined that the means chosen as hereinafter stated are reasonable and are closely fitted to achieve the desired objective of protecting citizens from intrusions upon residential privacy

lots 1purpose flag lots are intended to allow reasonable utilization of property that has sufficient acreage for development but lacks the required street frontage flag lots may be considered on parcels where the extension of public streets cannot or should not be extended due to the disruption of sensitive lands and natural features or potential of significant impacts to the surrounding neighborhood that would be caused by a public street although standard frontage requirements and public roadways are encouraged the intent of this ordinance is to allow flag lots if the development is the most harmonious to the existing subdivision layout andor is the least disruptive configuration for the neighborhood additionally flag lots may be considered for properties that have topographic constraints off lot configuration constraints caused by the built environment etc for which access by a public road is not feasible it is not the intent of this ordinance to promote flat lots in order to merely maximize the number of potential lots within a subdivision or to alleviate subdividing hardships that are self imposed 2flag lots are only permitted when one of the following two circumstances exists aat the time of application development using standard public streets is not possible the property has specific constraints that limit access public street frontage andor construction of a standard public roadway these abnormal constraints may be restrictive topography constraints caused by built environment irregular lot configuration ownership limitations environmental constraints such as wetlands springs ditches or canals etc bdevelopment using standard public streets is possible but not in the best interest of the public 3in order to demonstrate that this circumstance exists the applicant shall provide conceptual development plans showing the development with and without the proposed flag lot that demonstrate that each of the following characteristics is present athe design of the flag lot is harmonious and compatible with the configuration of the overall subdivision andor neighborhood and will not adversely affect the living environment of the surrounding area bstandard public street construction would cause disruption to the neighborhood in a significant physical or aesthetic manner therefore making the flag lot access preferable to a public street cdevelopment of the flag lot will decrease public infrastructure while still providing infill development and efficient use of the land that is compatible with lindon city development standards 4assuming an application meets the criteria in #2 above no more than one flag lot shall be permitted at the time of an initial subdivision application unless at their sole discretion the planning commission and city council determine that additional flag lots within a development provide for the most compatible overall design within a neighborhood as stated in the purpose of this ordinance it is not the intent of the city to promote flag lots in order for developers to merely maximize the number of potential lots within a subdivision 5a flag lot must be a minimum of 20000 square feet and the remaining parcel from which the flag was created must meet or exceed the minimum lot area requirements of the zone in which it is located the square footage calculation of such lots shall not include the area of any driveway access flag pole for the flag lot 6frontage driveway and development procedures apply as follows athe lot shall have at least twentyfive 25 feet of frontage on a dedicated public street which frontage serves as access only to the subject lot the 25 foot width shall be maintained for the full length of the flag pole portion of the platted lot bprior to recording the subdivision plat the developer shall post a bond with the city to cover installation of the driveway and utilities to the end of the flag pole portion of the lot cprior to issuance of a building permit for a dwelling on the flag lot installation of road base for the driveway and utilities shall be installed to at least the end of the flag pole portion of the lot dthe driveway serving the flag lot must have a surface traversable by a fire truck that is at least twenty 20 feet wide of which 16 feet must be paved with a hard surface prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the proposed dwelling where a fire hydrant is located along the flag pole portion of the lot the width of the lot adjacent to the fire hydrant must be thirtyone 31 feet wide rather than 25 feet wide and the surface traversable by a fire truck must be at least 26 feet wide rather than twenty 20 feet wide eprior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a dwelling on a flag lot the edges of the driveway area flag pole that are not paved shall be landscaped and properly maintained such landscaping shall not hinder emergency vehicle access to the property fan adequate emergency vehicle turnaround at the end of the driveway shall be constructed as approve by the fire chief an accessible fire hydrant shall be located within 200 feet of any dwelling on the flag lot possible adverse impacts of excessive driveway lengths shall be considered by the planning commission city council and emergency services gno parking or storage of any kind shall be allowed on the designated driveway ha flag lot driveway shall not serve more than one lot and shall have no more than one dwelling unit and an accessory apartment per lot other than accessory apartments r2 overlay projects are not permitted on flag lots iadjoining lots shall not be permitted to have access from a flag lot driveway 7construction of residences and accessory buildings on flag lots shall be limited to a maximum building height of 35 feet from finished grade building height restrictions shall be noted on the subdivision plat 8in order to further regulate the height of proposed structures fill at the perimeter of buildings on the flag lot shall be limited to no more than 4 feet above the street grade from which the property has access properties that have a preexisting grade that is higher than 4 feet above the street level are exempted from this fill limitation the planning director and city engineer may waive or modify the 4 foot fill limitation in specific instances where the fill limitation is found to be overly burdensome to the property owner ex the limited fill would prohibit utility connections to the dwelling or the limited fill creates drainage problems that cant be reasonably mitigated etc 9the address of the dwelling on the flag lot shall be clearly displayed and visible from the public road and shall be maintained in a way to differentiate the flag lot from any adjacent properties 10setbacks for the residence on the flag lot shall be defined as follows front yard setback shall be 30 feet rear yard setback shall be 30 feet and side yard setbacks shall be 15 feet on each side yard of the dwelling unit minimum setbacks shall be noted on the subdivision plat 11for purposes of determining the setbacks of the flag lot the front property line shall be the nearest line that is most parallel with the street from which the driveway accesses orientation of the dwelling is not regulated 12accessory structures for flag lots may be permitted in accordance with applicable section of the lindon city but shall be limited to 25 maximum height no accessory buildings shall be permitted on the flag pole portion of the driveway of the flag lot 13flag lots shall only be permitted in the r112 and r120 zones 14unless otherwise approved by the planning commission and city council all flag lot driveway access points on a public road must have at least two legal parcels located between any other flag lot driveway on the same side of the street flag lots may only be adjacent to each other if the flag lots are accessed from different roadways or at least two legal parcels are located between any other flag lot driveway on the same side of the street 15in addition to the minimum requirements above the planning commission and city council may impose additional conditions on flag lots including but not limited to the following  afencing and screening requirements binstallation of one or more fire hydrants or other safety related items cinstallation of curb andor gutter along private drives dother conditions that increase the compatibility of the proposed project with existing conditions and surroundings 16due

amended 2001  phased subdivisions 1purpose the intent of this section is to allow for incremental recordation of final plats and posting of public improvement bonds by allowing these steps in the subdividing process to be phased lindon city can approve a subdivisions master plan while relieving the applicant of the requirement of coming before the land use authority for each proposed phase this also reduces application processing time resulting in cost savings for the city additionally phasing may grant opportunity for traditional upfront costs of subdividing to be spread out over time thus granting an applicant a greater ability to see a project completion 2this section provides the steps required for phased subdivisions but is not intended to contain a comprehensive listing of all
