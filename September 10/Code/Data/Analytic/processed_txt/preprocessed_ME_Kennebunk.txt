state law and the state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a strncture be relocated in a manner that causes the strncture to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the applicable review board shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish the relocation when it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or wetland setback area in order to relocate a structure the applicable review board shall require replanting of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation in addition the area from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation replanting shall be required as follows a trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one native tree minimum 2 dbh for every tree removed if more than five trees are planted no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% of the number of trees planted replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or wetland than the trees that were removed other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or destroyed in order to relocate a strncture must be reestablished an area at least the same size as the area where vegetation andor ground cover was disturbed damaged or removed must be reestablished within the setback area the vegetation andor ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation andor ground cover that was disturbed destroyed or removed b where feasible when a strncture is relocated on a parcel the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which may consist of grasses shrubs trees or a combination thereof 3 reconstrnction or replacement any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from a water body tributary stream or wetland and which is removed or damaged or destroyed regardless of the cause by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within eighteen 18 months of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water body tributary stream or wetland setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the applicable review board in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity if the reconstructed or replacement structure is less than the required setback it shall not be any larger than the original structure except as allowed pmsuant to cl above as determined by the nonconforming floor area and volume of the reconstructed or replaced structure at its new location tfthe total amount of floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated 01 reconstructed beyond the required setback area no portion of the relocated or reconstructed structure shall be replaced or constructed at less than the setback requirement for a new structme when it is necessary to remove vegetation in order to replace or reconstruct a structure vegetation shall be replanted

value or damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place if a permit is obtained from the officer within one year of such damage destruction or removal in determining whether the building reconstruction 01 replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the applicable review board shall consider in addition to the criteria in c2 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 4 change of use of a nonconforming structure the use of a nonconforming structure may not be changed to another use unless the planning board or site review board if change is pmt of a site plan application after receiving a written application determines that the new use will have no

adjacent properties 2 building design  the town encourages high quality architectural design that is inspired by kennebunks traditional building style the following standards shall be addressed as part of the proposed building design architecture  the goal of these standards is to produce architecture that draws its inspiration from traditional new england vernacular traditional building styles and materials shall be used in a way to accommodate contemporary building needs buildings shall present an inviting humanscaled faade to the street internal drives parking areas and abutting properties scale of buildings  the scale of a building depends on its overall size the mass of it in relationship to the open space around it and the sizes of its doors windows porches and balconies the scale gives a building presence that is it makes it seem so big or small awkward or graceful overpowering or unimportant the scale of a building should be visually compatible with its site and with its neighborhood linear commercial structures eg shopping centers multitenant office buildings and other large commercial structures shall be visually unified use of complimentary architectural forms similar materials and colors variations in rooflines detailing and building heights and coordinated signage facades greater than 100 feet in length shall be designed with faade and roofline elements that reduce their scale and add architectural interest where the plane of a wall is broken the offset shall be proportional to the buildings height and length projections used to break up the mass of the building shall extend to the ground height  heights of new buildings and reconstruction of existing buildings should be visually compatible with the heights of the buildings in the neighborhood a sudden dramatic change in the building height can have a jarring effect on the overall look of the street if a buildings proposed height is 50% or higher than neighboring buildings the applicant shall incorporate architectural features in the buildings design that limit the visual impact of the proposed building roof shape  the shape and proportion of the roof shall be articulated so as to lend visual interest and reduce the apparent size of new buildings and should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with neighboring buildings  mixed uses and nonresidential uses national franchises  national franchises  eg restaurants service stations retail stores  are welcome and permitted forms of land use otherwise permitted in some of the zoning districts covering the route one corridor since the design of these buildings can contribute to a loss of identity for kennebunk by repeating the generic architectural forms that are repeated throughout the country buildings that are stylized to the point where the structure is a form of advertising are not permitted faade design and materials  the first impression that a building gives is very important all buildings shall present an inviting human scaled faade to the street internal drives parking areas and surrounding neighborhoods buildings with rt 1 frontage shall have at least one entrance to the building along the route 1 frontage  all sides of a building should receive design consideration blank walls facing public or private streets residential neighborhoods or abutting properties are prohibited where side or rear facades are visible from adjacent properties or roadways they shall be designed to complement the architectural treatment of the primary faade to give scale and visual interest  the pattern of solids and voids windows and doors in the front faade of a new or altered building should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with that of its neighbors  materials used on facades help to provide added character to a building  clapboards shingles brick etc  and therefore should be visually compatible to those of other buildings around it for facades of buildings visible from a public way preference shall be given to clapboard brick shingle and other materials commonly used in local architecture cinder block highly reflective metal siding stucco type siding are discouraged canopies  canopies should incorporate features to help them fit the scale and architectural character of the building a pitched roof or other traditional roof form shall be used and the fascia of the canopy shall be short in height generally not to exceed two feet primary entrance  the primary building entrance shall face the street unless the applicant can demonstrate that the circumstances of a given application merit an alternative orientation the entrance shall be identified use of architectural details that may include awnings or roofs for shelter recessing decorative lighting trim or railings in addition to pedestrian walkways connecting to parking areas and public sidewalks street corners  buildings located on street corners are important because these high visibility locations help define the character of both streets therefore the building facades along both streets shall be articulated no parking vehicular travel ways or service areas shall be located between the building and the property lines along both streets signage  the size scale materials illumination colors style and location of signs on the site have a visual impact on the streetscape signs shall state clearly the name of the business without overwhelming either the architecture or the streetscape multiuse sites shall prepare a signage master plan that provides size design and locations of the signs for all the proposed business spaces proposed for the site as well as any shared or joint identification signage proposed  mixed uses and nonresidential uses color  colors used on building exteriors should integrate a buildings various design elements or features the use of bright colors should be avoided softer muted or earthtoned colors are preferred colors should be compatible with the architectural character of surrounding buildings and neighborhood unless such surrounding buildings are not in conformance with these design standards to view examples of acceptable paint choices please see historic colors of america palette by california paints lighting  the proposed lighting plan shall be consistent with the

architectural design that is inspired by kennebunks traditional building style the following standards shall be addressed as part of the proposed building design architecture  the goal of these standards is to produce architecture that draws its inspiration from traditional new england vernacular traditional building styles and materials shall be used in a way to accommodate contemporary building needs buildings shall present an inviting humanscaled fa9ade to the street internal drives parking areas and abutting propertie s scale of buildings the scale of a building depends on its overall size the mass of it in relationship to the open space around it and the sizes of its doors windows porches and balconies the scale gives a building presence that is it makes it seem so big or small awkward or graceful overpowering or unimportant the scale of a building should be visually compatible with its site and with its neighborhood linear commercial structures eg shopping centers multitenant office building s and other large commercial structures shall be visually unified use of complimentary architectural forms similar materials and colors variations in rooflines detailing and building heights and coordinated signage facades greater than 100 feet in length shall be designed with fa9ade and roofline elements that reduce their scale and add architectural interest where the plane of a wall is broken the offset shall be proportional to the buildin gs height and length projections used to break up the mass of the building shall extend to the ground height heights of new buildings and reconstruction of existing building s should be visually compatible with the heights of the buildings in the neighborhood a sudden dramatic change in the building height can have a jarring effect on the overall look of the street if a buildings proposed height is 50% or higher than neighboring buildings  the applicant shall incorporate architectural features in the buildings design that limit the visual impact of the proposed building 8 roof shape the shape and proportion of the roof shall be articulated so as to lend visual interest and reduce the apparent size of new buildings and should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with neighboring buildings national franchises national franchises eg restaurants service stations retail stores  are welcome and permitted forms of land use otherwise permitted in some of the zoning districts covering the route one corridor since the design of these buildings can contribute to a loss of identity for kennebunk by repeating the generic architectural forms that are repeated throughout the country buildings that are stylized to the point where the structure is a form of advertising are not permitted fa ade design and materials  the first impression that a building gives is very important all buildings shall present an inviting human scaled fa9ade to the street internal drives parking areas and surrounding neighborhoods buildings with rt i frontage shall have at least one entrance to the building along the route 1 frontage  all sides of a building should receive design consideration blank walls facing public or private streets residential neighborhoods or abutting properties are prohibited where side or rear facades are visible from adjacent properties or roadways they shall be designed to complement the architectural treatment of the primary fa9ade to give scale and visual interest  the pattern of solids and voids windows and doors in the front fa9ade of a new or altered building should be visually compatible with the architectural style of the building and with that of its neighbors  materials used on facades help to provide added character to a building clapboards shingles brick  etc and therefore should be visually compatible to those of other buildings around it for facades of buildings visible from a public way preference shall be given to clapboard brick shingle and other materials commonly used in local architecture cinder block  highly reflective metal siding stucco type siding are discouraged canopies  canopies should incorporate features to help them fit the scale and architectural character of the building a pitched roof or other traditional roof form shall be used and the fascia of the canopy shall be short in height generally not to exceed two feet primary entrance  the primary building entrance shall face the street unless the applicant can demonstrate that the circumstances of a given application merit an alternative orientation the entrance shall be identified use of architectural details that may include awnings or roofs for shelter recessing decorative lighting trim or railings  in addition to pedestrian walkways connecting to parking areas and public sidewalks street corners  buildings located on street comers are important because these high visibility locations help define the character of both streets therefore the building facades along both streets shall be articulated no parking vehicular travel ways or service areas shall be located between the building and the property lines along both streets 9 as passed to town vote by bd of selectmen signage  the size scale materials illumination colors style and location of signs on the site have a visual impact on the streetscape signs shall state clearly the name of the business without overwhelming either the architecture or the streetscape multiuse sites shall prepare a signage master plan that provides size design and locations of the signs for all the proposed business spaces proposed for the site as well as any shared or joint identification signage proposed color colors used on building exteriors should integrate a buildings various design elements or features the use of bright colors should be avoided softer muted or earthtoned colors are preferred colors should be compatible with the architectural character of surrounding buildings and neighborhood unless such surrounding buildings are not in conformance with these design standards to view examples of acceptable paint choices please see

communities but as mark twain once said we take stock of a city like we take stock of a man the clothes or appearance are the externals by which we judge ln other words community appearance is also important unfortunately many arnerican communities have gotten used to ugliness accepting it as inevitable to progress just look around billboards cluttered com mercial strips and lookalike fast food restaurants are all too common across america there is an immense but too often ignored relationship between a communitys char acter and its economic well being attractive well planned communities always were designed one at a time st michaels maryland looked somewhat similar to nearby oxford but not quite like chestertown and a whole lot different from taos new mexico or beaufort south carolina regional style predominated and local variation provided uniqueness today however the subtle differences between places are fading and the bigger regional distinctions hardly exist now if you were dropped along a road outside of almost any american city you wouldnt have the slightest idea where you were because it all looks exactly the same ls it albany or allentown provi dence or pittsburgh  balti more or binningham who can tell attract more visitors and commercial strips and cookiecutter corporate high quality investment than designs can homogenize the visual character of a ugly ones unfortunately community by imposing a uniform look current zoning standards and today building materials can be imported from anywhere hills can be flattened and streams relocated we can environmental regulation s do lillle lo address visual quali ty community character or urban design  as a result many communities are slowly losing their un ique sense of place placelessness no two towns are exactly alike each has a particular street layout and arrangement of buildings shaped over time in a particular geography by a part icular population the dynamic forces of place time and culture work to create endless variations on the theme of city town vil lage or rural area at least they used to in another era local culture and geography played a larger role in the shaping of towns build ings were constructed of local materials regional architectural styles predominated businesses were locally owned and building technology was limited  roads curved and dipped buildings were added onto signs transform the landscape vith great speed and build any thing that meets our budget or strikes our fanc} techno logical innovation and the global economy all make it easy for buildi ng plans drawn up at a corporate head quarters in new jersey to be applied over and over again in illinois california or maryland over the last 40 years americas commercial landscape has progressed from the unique to the uniform from the stylized to the standard ized a big reason for this is the proliferation of chain stores franchises and big box retailers about this booklet this booklet is designed to show how new commercial development can be made more amactive more efficient more profitable and more compat ible with local commu nity identity this booklet focuses on ways to improve the appearance design and siting of chain stores franchises  and big box retailers  ask franchises and chain stores to fit in vhich of these fast food franchises made an attempt to fit in with the local community o rranch i ses and cha i n stores in your buildings in our autooriented sodely and their look hometown have lo be in the same style building alike architecture contributes lo the homogenization of as those in new york north carolina or neva  american communities chain drugstores for example cla the answer is a resounding no of course not national franchises and chain stores can nnd do change their standard building design to fit in wilh the local character of the surrounding community but they we shape oru buildings and afterwards our buildings shape us winston chunhill are prolifera ting across the country hun dreds of large singlestory featureless buildings are being constructed on downtovl1comersoften after historic buildings have been razed likewise massive big box retailers have over whelmed many smaller communities only do this in communities sawy enough to insist on something better than offtheshelf cookiecutter archi lectu re experience shows that if you accept standard lookalike corporate design this is what you ll get on the other hand if your communit} insists on a customized site specific design that is what you will get to understand how see the lips and suggestions lhat follow the bottom line for most chain stores and franchises is securing access to profitable trade areas they evaluate locations based on lheir economic potential if they are asked to address local histo1ic presenation site planning or architectural concerns they will usually do so fastfood restaurants gas stations convenience stores and chain dmg stores are some of the most prominenl 2 bett e r models for commercial deelopment physically as well as economically but as more communi ties have recognized the economic value of preserving their sense of place lhere increasingly are examples of where these huge companies have adapted their designs or even their locations ro meet local standards today communities all across amer ica are working successfully with franchises chain stores and big box relailers to get buildings that fit in see the examples thal follow things you should knov  design review is one means of ensuring the compatibil ity of franchise design with local community character  more than 3000 cities towns and counties nation vide exercise some type of design review over new commercial construction  many others have voluntary design guidelines or use other techniques to get build ings to respect local communily identity 11 chesterfield county virginia santa barbara california and sedona  arizona have clone a particularly good job developing design standards that require franchises and chain stores to fit in with the character of the com munity  een without a formal design review ordinance a com munity can develop voluntary design guidelines  these can help lo foster n ew buildings in harmony with their chain stores and franchises should be good neigh sunoundings especially if combined with public edu hors but often they are not cation and incentives  a chain stores and franchises that respect community character can be found in every region of the country  many communities including rockville and chester town maryland have placed limits on the size of commercial buildings to ensure that national retailers are an appropriate scale  other communities limit the amount of land covered by the building in effect allowing more square footage in additional sto1ies gaithersburg maryland for example limits commercial buildings to 80000 square feet per floor thus encouraging multistory buildings  target kohls toysrus  and olher bigbox retailers have con structed attractive twostol buildings in gaithersburg a big boxes can also locate in downtowns or in existing buildings both walmart and target lme developed twostory build ings in several communities for exam ple vlalman recently opened a store in a mixeduse urban location in long beach california withoul the usual sea of parking in front instead the parking is in two nearby garages  toysrus has twosto1y down town bu ildings in many communities  a national survey found that a majority of consumers would prefer to shop in a town center with a mix of stores and ciyic buildings rather than in a strip shop ping center the bigger the store the bigger the parking lot and the wider the roads that lead to it in gaithersburg maryland the target is in a two story building which means it uses less land fits better with the community and is accessible on foot better models for contercial developmekt 3  better models for fast food

commercial strips are often ugly and congested eople like the convenience and low prices of dis count stores supermarkets and chain restaurants but the same people often complain about the ugli ness and traffic congestion associated with commercial strip development progress does not require turning every major road corridor into an endless parade of parking lots pole signs and bland strip shopping centers commercial strips can be redesign ed to make them more atcracrive less con gested and more convenient for shoppers and pedestrians communities can begin the process of reclaiming existing commercial snips by agreeing to a longterm design pro gram that gradually transforms strips into mixeduse town centers these steps can help 1 put a finn limit on the length of any commercial district  instead of a longer strip allow commercial expansion in greater depth this concentrates commer cial uses and encourages shared parking and walking between stores 2 limit curb cuts and consolidate entrances along the road to a few main driveways with internal service streets based on a block system to connect businesses this relieves traffic backups accidents and the need for expensive road widening 3 help unify the streetscape with continuous street trees highquality parkinglot landscaping and where town centers are more attrattive and less congested possible  planted medians in the main roadways to prevent unlimited lefthand turns 4 build sidewalks and crosswalks throughout the area to encourage shared parking public transporta  tion and walking between stores and to nearby homes and offices 5 build a street frontage by filling in the front of large parking lots with small closely spaced store fronts with parking behind or on the side 6 provide incentives for
