preserve the integrity of the historic district  2 to maintain the special character of the district as reflected in the scale mass location and style of buildings  3 to assess the historical and architectural value of buildings and structures their settings and their local or national significance in terms of the represented time period visible architecture construction materials or relationship to a historically recognized individual or event  4 to encourage designs for new buildings and structures additions to buildings and structures and the reuse of existing buildings and structures that complement and enhance the citys architectural and historic character and contribute to its sense of place  5 to foster portsmouths heritage and economic wellbeing conservation and

time therefore it is in the public interest to ensure architectural review and approval of all new structures and significant changes to existing structures within the district  a tension often exists between the publics interest in preserving and enhancing the citys historic fabric and sense of place and other interests that might damage that goal therefore the commissions role includes assisting
