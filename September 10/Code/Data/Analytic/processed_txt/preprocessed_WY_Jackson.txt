unevenaged multistoried stands of trees with oldgrowth attributes where there are trees suitable for perching these stands of trees are often located near waterbodies and watercourses which provide foraging opportunities nests are generally in one of the largest trees in the stand and in most instances are located so that the bald eagle is provided an unobstructed view of the surrounding area bald eagles frequently construct alternate nests within a breeding territory and may use these for nesting during other years in the teton county area bald eagles select nest sites which provide maximum foraging opportunity generally bald eagles return annually to nest in the same area this is the result of a unique combination of environmental factors that make a specific nesting habitat

trumpeter swans build their nests on islands or in extensive stands of emergent vegetation the same nest site is often used repeatedly by a swan pair unless disturbance or other factors cause abandonment important attributes of trumpeter swan nesting areas include proximity to feeding areas which have early iceoff and provide sufficient food for prenesting swan pairs  proximity to suitable nest building materials  availability and dispersion of feeding areas for cygnets 140 days old  and juxtaposition and interspersion of emergent vegetative cover relative to feeding areas for concealment escape and as a buffer to human disturbance k essential to protect nest areas for the viable maintenance of the trumpeter swan population it is essential that the trumpeter swan nesting areas be protected because without its maintenance the trumpeter swan would not be able to procreate and survive l winter swan habitat because the trumpeter swan does not migrate from teton county during winter as waterfowl normally do maintenance of its winter habitat is also crucial to its survival trumpeter swans like other waterfowl species require rooted aquatic vegetation for food this vegetation grows in soft sediment along shallow stream and creek bottoms and in shallow ponds and lakes during winter not all aquatic features are available to trumpeter swans due to surface freezing this limits the amount of winter habitat available to trumpeter swans this in combination with competition for food with other swans and waterfowl species makes winter a very critical time for trumpeter swans m trumpeter swan winter habitat trumpeter swan winter habitat generally consists of water areas of palustrineaquatic bed and unconsolidated shore and bottoms with soft subsurface substrates of greater than 2 inches in depth winter water depths of less than 43 feet watercourse channels of 50 feet or more banks with little or no shrubbery or tree cover and gradual slopes which

teton county it only inhabits the upper reaches of the snake river in wyoming and extreme eastern idaho jackson lake and the palisades reservoir b economic importance the cutthroat trout is a sport fish which attracts many fishermen to teton county without a healthy cutthroat trout population the county would lose significant tourist dollars c development has affected trout in earlier times it was relatively easy to maintain a strong and viable population of cutthroat trout because suitable spawning and nursery habitat could be found in most of the valleys springcreeks today however this is not the case because of the construction and maintenance of flood control levees along the snake river and concomitant water quality impacts caused by ranching irrigation and other agricultural practices have degraded this spawning habitat d cutthroat trout spawning area limited today cutthroat trout spawning in teton county is confined to small sections of a few springfed creeks flowing into the snake river e cutthroat trout spawning areas the cutthroat trout spawning sites generally fall within areas of palustrineunconsolidated shore and bottoms and upper perennialunconsolidated shore and bottoms preference is for cold welloxygenated gravelbottomed watercourses in these areas cutthroat trout build redds gravel nests to lay incubate and hatch their eggs redds are generally constructed in gravel substrate which ranges in size from 05  25 inches in diameter f spawning hatching and nursery cutthroat trout typically enter springcreeks between march and april with the spawning occurring between march and june depending upon the location fry emerge throughout late spring and early summer and reside in the creeks throughout their first year g essential spawning area

fish eagles distributed throughout the world the contrasting black white and yellow coloration of this raptor is visually striking an act of congress in 1782 officially adopted the bald eagle as the symbol of the united states representing freedom strength and beauty although individual eagles are truly powerful and impressive birds the species as a whole is very sensitive and susceptible to disturbance b federal recognition once listed as a federally endangered species bald eagle populations have rebounded from the brink of extinction although populations have steadied the federal government continues to protect the bald eagle under the bald and golden eagle protection act and the migratory bird treaty act c bald eagle population in gye is one of most important the bald eagle population residing in the greater yellowstone ecosystem of which teton county is a part is one of the most important bald eagle breeding populations in the united states d survival of bald eagles the survival of bald eagles depends in part on the availability of suitable habitat the abundance of food and reproductive success which is closely linked to the availability of forage and the lack of disturbance e important to protect bald eagle nesting areas because bald eagles are sensitive to human development and activity especially during time of breeding and nesting it is essential to protect bald eagle nesting areas to ensure the animals survival f bald eagle nest area generally bald eagle nesting areas occur in unevenaged multistoried stands of trees with oldgrowth attributes where there are trees suitable for perching these stands of trees are generally located near watercourses and waterbodies which provide foraging opportunities nests are generally in one of the largest trees in a given stand and in most instances are located so that the bird is provided an unobstructed view of the surrounding area bald eagles frequently construct alternate nests within a breeding territory and may use these for nesting during other years in the teton county area bald eagles select nest sites which provide maximum foraging opportunity generally bald eagles return annually to nest in the same area this is the result of a unique combination of environmental factors that make a specific nest area best suited for reproduction g crucial nesting habitat essential to survival the snake river floodplain between moose and palisades reservoir and its associated riparian zone represents crucial nesting habitat for the bald eagle it is crucial to the survival of bald eagles in teton county that this habitat be protected from the impacts of development the loss of this habitat would profoundly impact and detrimentally modify the behavior patterns of bald eagles including

use standards applicable in all zones | div 63 affordable workforce housing standards  purpose and findings   div 63 affordable workforce housing standards div 63  purpose and findings   663311 a purpose the purpose of these affordable workforce housing standards is to ensure that affordable workforce housing is provided to the local workforce by employee generating development proportionate with the need for affordable workforce housing it creates b legislative findings in adopting this the town council finds 1 a local workforce is a defining feature of community character an essential component of the community character and social economic and political fabric of teton county and the town of jackson over the years is the presence of those persons and families that work in the community live in the community attend schools in the community worship in the community and vote in the community maintenance of a local workforce is key to a balanced and sustainable local economy and resilient level of critical service provision 2 supply of local workforce housing is limited by affordability one of the primary factors that historically allowed this special community character in teton county and the town of jackson is that until the mid1990s the cost of housing was affordable to those persons living and working in the community beginning in the mid1980s a significant second home market emerged in jackson hole these home buyers came from different parts of the country and had substantially higher incomes than the local workforce they have contributed to a dramatic increase in land and construction costs in the community resulting in a substantial increase in the price of housing this increase in housing prices when coupled with slightly increasing or static local workforce wages accounting for inflation has made marketrate housing unaffordable to most of the local workforce forcing many to move outside the community review of state and national census and other wage and labor data demonstrate this trend a in 198 median sales prices of homes $90000 in teton county and the town of jackson were on target with the affordable housing price for a median income household $90667 from that point in time forward housing prices have increased so that they no longer align with what is affordable to median income households b by 200 the median sales price $565000 was nearly 3 times the price that was affordable to a median income household $196333 c in 200 the median sales price $1075000 was approximately 4 times the price affordable to a median income household $270000 654 town of jackson land development regulations use standards applicable in all zones | div 63 affordable workforce housing standards  purpose and findings   d while the great recession had an impact on housing prices even during the downturn housing was never affordable to most of the workforce in 201 the median sales price of housing $853150 was more than 26 times the price that is affordable to a median income household $320667 e by 201 the affordability gap had returned to pregreat recession levels with the median sales price $1130000 at 395 times the price that is affordable to a median income household $286000 3 local housing supply has not been added at the same rate as local jobs in conjunction with the decrease in affordability there is a shortage of local workforce housing because job growth has outpaced housing growth since 200 jobs have grown at an annual rate of 21% while the nubmer of housing units has only grown at an annual rate of 16% 4 as a result the percentage of the workforce living locally has declined these phenomena have resulted in a number of persons employed in the community and their families being forced to move outside the community to places like teton county idaho and lincoln county wyoming estimates indicate that in 1986 approximately 91% of the workforce lived locally in 1995 this number had decreased to approximately 80% by 2005 it was 68% by 201 it was estimated only 58% of the workforce resided locally 5 the decline in the local workforce has resulted in a deterioration of community character this decline in the percentage of the workforce living locally has resulted in an impairment of the social economic and political fabric of the community along with the communitys character estimates indicate this problem will continue to worsen in the future unless additional housing is provided within price and rental ranges that are affordable to the workforce more specifically a a local workforce household is more likely to reinvest socially civically and economically in the community as a greater percentage of the workforce commutes their children no longer attend schools in the community they no longer worship in the community and they no longer express their ideas at the ballot box b a local workforce results in a more balanced and sustainable local economy and resilient provision of critical services as the community becomes more reliant on commuters it also becomes more susceptible to weather events that adversely impact the local economy and the provision of critical community services c a local workforce also results in a healthier ecosystem a commuter workforce generates more traffic than a local workforce which results in greater impact to wildlife and the environment in general d the lack of local affordable workforce housing opportunities will result in the loss of generational continuity if there are few housing opportunities available that are affordable to the workforce there is little chance town of jackson land development regulations 655 use standards applicable in all zones | div 63 affordable workforce housing standards  applicability   children who grow up in the community can raise their own families in the community and continue to support and participate in the civic and social life of the community which they have been a part of their entire lives 6 as a result the community set a workforce housing goal to address the impacts from this loss of the local workforce in 2012 teton county and the town of jackson set a goal in the jacksonteton county comprehensive plan to ensure a variety of workforce housing opportunities exist in the community so that at least 65% of those employed locally live locally 7 to implement this goal development must provide mitigation for the need for affordable workforce housing it creates to assist in the implementation of this goal these standards require employee generating development to provide affordable workforce housing proportionate to the need it creates 8 for these reasons these affordable workforce housing standards are hereby adopted by the town council c technical support the technical support and analysis upon which these affordable workforce housing standards are established is based upon the teton county and town of jackson employee generation land use study  as amended which is incorporated herein by reference d authority the town council of the town of jackson has the authority to adopt these affordable workforce housing standards in accordance with of the wyoming constitution and et seq wyoming statutes and such other authorities and provisions that are established in the statutory and common law of the state of wyoming  applicability    these affordable workforce housing standards apply to any employee generating development unless exempted below a employee generating development employee generating development is a new building or use not currently in existence as further defined below 1 existence for the purpose of this standard existance shall mean a building or use existing on  or the building or use legally established since that date with the highest affordable workforce housing requirement the burden of identifying the existing building or use shall be the responsibility of the landowner the landowner shall provide the planning director photos permits licenses records or other documentation that establishes the existing building or use 656 town of jackson land development regulations use standards applicable in all zones | div 63 affordable workforce housing standards  applicability   example on  the use of a property was a restaurant bar in 2000 the use of the property changed to retail in 2010 the use of the property changed to office the exiting use for the purpose of this standard is restaurantbar because restaurantbar use has the highest affordable workforce housing requirement of the legal uses since  example an office space built as permitted in 2004 is considered existing for the purpose of this standard regardless of the employee mitigation provided in 2004 a this definition of existence shall not apply to an attached singlefamily unit or apartment for which housing mitigation has not been provided it shall apply to other residential uses example an existing apartment building built prior to 1995 is being razed to build a new apartment building because the apartment building being razed did not provide any affordable housing mitigation when it was built the new apartment building would be subject to this division as though the apartment building being razed did not exist 2 other types of development this division only applies to new building and use a nonbuilding physical development development option or subdivision is not employee generating development and not subject to this division except that f6 requires a planned resort master plan to include an estimation of the affordable workforce housing that will be required for the entire resort and a housing mitigation plan for the entire resort example this division does not apply to an application for a singlefamily subdivision this division will be applied to each lot in the subdivision at the time a building permit is submitted b approved unbuilt development 1 approval prior to  employee generating development approved prior to  which has not yet been developed shall also be subject to this division upon submittal of any required application to complete the development example there is no credit for an existing vacant lot a subdivision completed in 1992 approved construction of a detached singlefamily unit on each of the lots in the subdivision upon application for a building permit to build a unit on one of the lots in the subdivision this division shall apply example a planned unit development approved in 2004 allows commercial and residential development on a site but does not include a specific housing mitigation plan outlining the required number of affordable and employee housing units upon application for a development plan building permit or use permit under that pud this division shall apply town of jackson land development regulations 657 use standards applicable in all zones | div 63 affordable workforce housing standards  applicability   2 substantial amendment to prior approval in addition this division shall apply to all employee generating development not completed under an existing approval when that existing approval is substantially amended regardless of whether the amendment applies to the entire uncompleted portion of the approval and regardless of the approved housing mitigation plan or housing mitigation agreement a substantial amendment is any amendment that would increase the amount of affordable workforce housing required example a sketch plan was approved for a 3 building development and included a housing mitigation plan only 1 building has been built and only the required housing associated with the built building has been provided an amendment to the sketch plan is proposed to increase the size of 1 of the unbuilt buildings the amount of affordable workforce housing required to approve the amendment would be equal to the current requirement for both unbuilt buildings c exemptions the following are exempt from the standards of this division 1 housing department unit a residential unit subject to a deed restriction administered by the housing department 2 other workforce housing a residential unit subject to a deed restriction administered by the jackson hole community housing trust or habitat for humanity of the greater teton area  or an apartment in the nl5 zone 3 historic building use of a building included

historic building is used in its historic location floor area elsewhere on the site equal to the amount of historic floor area used onsite is also exempt example a 2000 square foot historic cabin being converted into a restaurant would be exempt from this division if the historic cabin has not been moved and is being used as a restaurant in its historic location another 2000 square feet of floor area elsewhere on the site are also exempt from this division if the historic cabin has been relocated from another location only the cabin itself is exempt 4 agriculture an agriculture use b 5
