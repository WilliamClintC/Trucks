determination is appropriate when the adjustment is necessary to maintain the park owners net operating income at the same level as the base year in accordance with the following 1 net operating income noi a net operating income equals gross income minus operating expenses b gross income equals the following i gross rents computed as gross rental income at one hundred percent occupancy  plus ii interest from security and cleaning deposits except to the extent that such interest is payable to the homeownersresidents  plus iii income from services garage and parking fees  plus iv all other income or consideration received or receivable for or in connection with the use or occupancy of rental spaces and housing services  minus v uncollected rents due to vacancy and bad debts to the extent the same are beyond the landlords control uncollected rents in excess of three percent of gross rents shall be presumed to be unreasonable unless established otherwise c operating expensesinclusions i operating expenses shall include the following license fees real property taxes utility costs insurance maintenance and management expenses contracted or owner performed including necessary and reasonable advertising accounting other managerial expenses normal repair and maintenance expenses allowable legal expenses and the amortized cost of capital improvements unless established otherwise management expenses are presumed to be six percent of gross income ii ownerperformed labor shall be counted at reasonable rates as established by city council regulation iii

unlawful detainer actions not in violation of applicable law to the extent the same are not recovered from homeownersresidents attorneys fees and costs incurred in proceedings before the hearing officer or in connection with civil actions against the hearing officer are not allowed as operating expenses unless required by law e base year for the purpose of this be 1995 f presumption of fair base year net operating income except as provided in paragraph g of this subdivision it shall be presumed that the net operating income produced by the property during the base year provided a fair return fair net operating income landlords shall be entitled to earn a just and reasonable return and to maintain and increase their base year net operating income in accordance with paragraph h of this subdivision g rebutting the presumption it may be determined that the base year net operating income yielded other than a fair return in which case the base year net operating income may be adjusted accordingly in order to make such a determination the hearing officer must make at least one of the following findings h the landlords operating and maintenance expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years in such instances adjustments may be made in calculating such expenses so that the base year operating expenses reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time in considering whether the base year net operating income yielded more or less than a fair net operating income the hearing officer shall consider the following factors a the landlord made substantial capital improvements during the base year which were not reflected in the base year rent levels  b substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by uninsured disaster or vandalism  c maintenance and repair were below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration of housing services  d other expenses were unreasonably high or low notwithstanding prudent business practice the rent on the base date was disproportionately high or low due to the fact that it was not established in an armslength transaction or other peculiar circumstances i fair net operating income approval by the hearing officer of a rent increase in the amount of sixty percent of the total percentage increase in the cpi over the base year shall be presumed to create a fair net operating income unless this presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing on the park owners application for a rent increase for example if the cpi has increased by ten percent since the base year the landlord shall be entitled to a net operating income which is six percent above the base year level a rent increase granted pursuant to this section shall not exceed the increase requested in the application for the purposes of this the current cpi shall be the cpi last reported as of the date of the application b substantive grounds for rent adjustment applied for by homeowner a homeowners application for an adjustment of the rent shall be approved when it is determined that a reduction in rent will not cause the park owner to be unable to receive a just and reasonable return on its investment such a determination is appropriate when the adjustment may be made without reducing the park owners net operating income from the base year level this may occur in the event that the park owners operating expenses have been reduced due to a decrease in costs or a reduction of services provided within the mobile home park however in no case shall an adjustment of the rent be approved such that the rent is lower than the base rent plus the current permissive rent increase pursuant to therefore in most circumstances a home owners application for adjustment to reduce rent may be approved only where a park owners application for a rent increase above the base rent and permissive rent increase was approved in a prior year     refusal of homeowner to pay illegal rent a homeowner may refuse to pay any rent in excess of the rent approved under this chapter the fact that such unpaid rent is in excess of the rent approved shall be a defense in any action brought to recover possession of a mobile home space for nonpayment or collection of rent     remedies any person who demands accepts or retains any payment of rent in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be liable in civil action to the person from whom such payment is demanded accepted or retained for damages up to an amount equal to three times the payments demanded accepted or retained together with reasonable attorneys fees and costs as determined by the court     repealer the ordinance codified in this chapter

suitable open space purposes such as for agricultural forestry outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only  nature of variance a the variance criteria set forth in this based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  variance  appeal board a in passing upon requests for variance the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for each $100 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variance issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration and federal emergency management agency  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variance shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the governing body need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the governing body believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in  to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a and are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of c and the purposes of this the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this 36 hillside

design guidelines to assist property owners and project designers in understanding the citys goals for attaining high quality development that is sensitive to the citys unique character  applicability these guidelines will be used during the land use permit process as additional project review criteria a the provisions of this whenever access andor parking are provided for a project regardless of whether the access or parking are required by this development addition relocation or construction requiring land use permit approval in compliance with land use and development permit procedures shall follow these guidelines where applicable b the following guidelines may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects as not all design criteria may be workableappropriate for each project in some circumstances a guideline may be relaxed in order to accomplish another more important guideline the overall objectives are to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed and to attain the best possible design within reason  general parking guidelines a location of parking areas aside from concerns for traffic safety and efficiency the appearance of parking lots from the standpoint of their visual impact is an important concern projects should be laid out so that parking lots are not the dominant feature of the development when viewed from the street generally it is not advisable to place the parking area along the front of the site because it creates a negative visual impact which detracts from the projects architectural image parking placed along the side or to the rear of a site or within a complex of buildings allows project architecture and the beauty of the landscaped open space to take precedence see figure 315 location of parking areas figure 315 location of parking areas b limiting pavement paving areas of the site for parking and other vehicle use beyond the minimum necessary to comply with the requirements of this development strongly discouraged the city requires significant landscaping adjacent to the perimeter of the parking area and along the street frontage to soften the appearance of paved areas  access and circulation a primary project entries should be designed as special statements reflective of the character of the project the goal should be to establish a distinctive and inviting image for the project textured paving flowering accents low walls shrubs and the use of specimen trees 36 box or larger should be used to generate visual interest at entry points to commercial centers b entry drives on larger projects 200 or more parking stalls should include a minimum five foot wide landscaped median to separate incoming and outgoing traffic see figure 316 entry drives for large  figure 316 entry drives for large driveways should be coordinated with existing or planned median openings driveways should also align with driveways on the opposite side of the roadway d the first parking stall that is perpendicular to an entry driveway or the first aisle juncture that is perpendicular should be a least 40 feet back from the curb to provide adequate vehicle queuing distance off the street with larger centers a longer setback distance may be required see figure 317 queuing area figure 317 queuing area e nonresidential projects are encouraged to provide crossaccess to adjacent nonresidential properties for convenience safety and efficient circulation a mutual access agreement shall be executed where cross access is provided a shared parking reduction may be allowed in compliance with adjustments to offstreet parking requirements  parking lot design a parking lots should be designed with a hierarchy of circulation major access drives with no parking  major circulation drives with little or no parking  and then parking aisles for direct access to parking spaces small projects may need to combine components of the hierarchy b proposed parking lots with compact spaces should be designed to disperse the compact spaces throughout the parking area c parking lots should include landscaping that accents the importance of the driveways from the street frames major circulation aisles and highlights pedestrian pathways see figure 318 circulation hierarchy and landscaping figure 318 circulation hierarchy and landscaping d dropoff points ie wider aisles located near entrances to major buildings and plaza areas should be provided for projects over 50000 square feet of building area e parking areas should be separated from buildings by either a raised walkway or landscape strip at least four feet wide situations where parking aisles or spaces directly abut the building are strongly discouraged see figure 319 separation of parking from structures figure 319 separation of parking from structures f intersections should be kept to a minimum and dead end aisles should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and then proper backup areas are required g parking lots should be broken up into segments or modules by means of intervening landscaping access driveways or structures to avoid large unbroken expanses of paved area h parking and circulation areas should be screened from public streets by combinations of low walls berms plant materials and changes in grade the height of the screen should not cause visibility problems at entrances or along pedestrian ways  pedestrian connections a pedestrian and bicycle access should be designed to physically and visually link the site to the public sidewalk and

of residential development design guidelines  purpose of residential design guidelines to assist project designers and property owners in understanding and implementing the citys goals for attaining high quality residential development and for preserving the small town character of the city these guidelines are not intended to promote one type of development over another their primary objective is to encourage well designed residential neighborhoods which a deemphasize the dominance of the automobile  b promote pedestrian and bicycle traffic corridors  c provide community open space throughout the development  d protect the natural environment  e promote mixed use where appropriate  and f cluster housing and other structures to establish more open space  applicability a the provisions of this to all tentative maps for residential projects b the review authority may exercise discretion in applying these guidelines to specific projects as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for each project in some circumstances a guideline may be relaxed in order to accomplish another more important guideline the overall objective is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the design guidelines are followed and to attain the best possible design within reason  development context and continuity the following guidelines address the edges of new residential projects that is how a new residential development should relate to its surroundings a develop neighborhoods new patterns of development should ensure that 1 they are compatible with the character of established or adjacent neighborhoods  2 groups of new projects together create true neighborhoods not isolated compounds  and 3 features of the natural landscape are preserved b continuous streets new residential subdivisions shall align public streets with those of adjacent developments avoiding the tendency to become enclaves apart from the rest of the community public streets shall be planned to be continuous residential developments where permitted by terrain and other natural features weaving the community together and simplifying traffic circulation through traffic should be accommodated in a manner that discourages the use of neighborhood roadways especially local streets c incorporation of open space new residential developments should incorporate open space public or private and any creeks or riparian areas in project design subdivision design should provide maximum access and visibility to these areas d frontage roads where a project adjoins a public park or open space frontage roads are a good means of providing visibility and public access to the open space while at the same time providing separation of residences from the open space see figure 51 use of frontage roads figure 51 use of frontage roads e fences 1 fences along ridges should be of open construction to allow for protection of scenic views 2 fencing adjacent to open space areas should be of a wood or wood substituterail type fencing should have a maximum height of six feet with horizontal rails or open wire sufficiently spaced to restrict trespassing and to provide security but to allow for animal movement deer etc across these areas see figure 52 appropriate fencing f gated neighborhoods gated neighborhoods isolate parts of the community from others and shall not be allowed figure 52 appropriate fencing  project site planning the following guidelines relate to the internal organization of residential subdivisions the intent of these guidelines is to ensure that the relationships between housing units and other onsite uses are attractive and create visual variety along project streets a new streets shall connect with adjacent existing streets to form a continuous neighborhood network b natural historic and cultural amenities eg views mature trees creeks riparian vegetation rock outcropping rock walls mining features etc should be preserved and incorporated into proposed projects to the greatest extent feasible see hillside development standards see figure 53 incorporating natural amenities figure 53 incorporating natural amenities c site design should not change natural drainage patterns site grading should be sensitive to existing landforms and topography so that the natural setting may be preserved to the greatest extent possible when modifications are necessary surface drainage with appropriate retention or detention facilities is preferred to underground systems d subdivisions for detached singlefamily homes should be designed with varied front yard setbacks long monotonous rows of homes set at the same setback are strongly discouraged see figure 54 varied entry setbacks figure 54 varied entry setbacks e singlefamily parcels should avoid a patterned cookie cutter look by employing a variety of lot sizes widths and shapes whenever possible except where this pattern has already been established in the neighborhood see figure 55 varied parcel design figure 55 varied parcel design f existing healthy mature trees should be preserved and incorporated into project landscaping to the greatest extent feasible g development on sloping sites should follow the natural contours of the land stepped building pads and larger setbacks should be used to preserve the general shape of natural land forms and to minimize grade differentials with adjacent streets and with adjoining properties see hillside development standards see figure 53 incorporating natural amenities h curbadjacent sidewalks create an undesirable urban appearance and are strongly discouraged detached sidewalks or pedestrian paths separated from the road with variablewidth parkways are preferred i new roads and roadway improvements should be located constructed and maintained in a manner that prevents adverse impacts to water quality and significant biological scenic and historic resources j permeable paving shall be utilized wherever feasible k alleys should be designed into the development plan whenever possible to allow for garages and vehicle access to be situated at the rear of houses  energy conservation and solar orientation the consideration of passive solar energy techniques in subdivision design is strongly encouraged where not in conflict with the objective of preserving the natural features of the site a street orientation streets that run generally east and west are encouraged because they increase the likelihood and desirability of houses sited with solar access to the south southwall glass is important to providing maximum passive solar heating where streets do run primarily east and west solar access can still be provided by creative lot configuration and siting of units on the lots see figure 56 solar orientation of parcels figure 56 solar orientation of parcels b setbacks placing a house near the north boundary of its lot allows a major portion of the open space to the south of each unit to be controlled by the owner of the house rather than by an adjacent neighbor flexibility in setback requirements may be considered to achieve adequate solar orientation when other aspects of the project are also designed to incorporate passive heating and cooling techniques see figure 57 setbacks for solar access figure 57 setbacks for solar access c siting in general houses should be sited so that southfacing glass is maximized east and westfacing glass is minimized units attached in preferred eastwest directions should not be staggered so as to block south glass collector surfaces also units should not be sited closer to northern units than solar access angles will allow see figure 58 south facing glass figure 58 south facing glass d orienting homes adjacent to mature trees for shade is a passive solar energy technique that is encouraged e integrating deep porches and overhangs in the design of homes is suggested for minimizing energy consumption and it also is compatible with the motherlode style  pedestrian and vehicular circulation in an effort to avoid residential subdivisions in the city of jackson having a typical urban or suburban appearance following design alternatives may be considered a gravel pedestrian ways when attempting to preserve trees and pedestrian traffic is anticipated to be light compacted gravel pedestrian ways may be incorporated for pedestrian circulation gravel walks should be a minimum of sixfeet wide and be designed to drain properly b reduced centerline radius to reduce vehicle speeds when rounding curves on neighborhood streets short radius curves should be incorporated into the project design where possible with minimum and maximum radii established by the city engineer and the citys improvement standards tentative map filing and processing  tentative map preparation application contents a general content requirements tentative map submittals shall include the application forms and all information and other
