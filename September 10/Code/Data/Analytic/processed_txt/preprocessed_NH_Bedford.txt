limitations is appropriate a users implementing process changes may request that compliance be determined based on mass limitations in lieu of concentration limitations such massbased limitations will be calculated from the permitted concentrationbased limitations and flows and shall be equivalent to or less than the mass discharge in effect at the time of the request the intent of a massbased limit is to encourage and allow pollution prevention andor water conservation measures that might cause a facility to increase pollutant concentrations in its discharge even though the total mass of the pollutant discharged does not increase and may in fact decrease decisions on granting requests for massbased compliance limitations will be based on userspecific information and current operating conditions of the wastewater collection system and will be at the discretion of the director implementation of massbased limitations may not contravene any requirements of federal or state laws andor

characteristics of these traditional neighborhoods include dwellings shops and workplaces generally located in close proximity to each other  1 appropriately sized buildings fronting on and aligned with streets in a disciplined manner generally uninterrupted by parking lots  2 generally regular geometric patterns of streets and blocks arranged to provide comprehensible and interesting routes of travel  3 a hierarchy of streets some narrow and convenient for a balanced mix of both pedestrians and automobiles while others wider to carry greater traffic and perhaps serve as the major ceremonial avenue boulevard or commercial main street  4 well configured squares greens gardens and parks woven into street and block patterns and dedicated to collective social activity recreation and visual enjoyment  5 a recognizable functionally diverse visually unified neighborhood or town center often focused on a major civic space such as a village green or square frequently also linked to a traditionally important crossroads or waterfront  and 6 a builtup neighborhood area with an overall size small enough to permit residents and workers if they so choose to walk or ride bicycles comfortably rather than being required to drive throughout much of the neighborhood 7 b the town recognizes for the purposes of this section of the zoning the desirability of promoting an ordinance
