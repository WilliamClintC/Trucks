zoning appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see definition upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 in passing upon such applications the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this  a the danger that materials may be swept onto other property to the injury of others  b the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion  67 c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage  d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e the necessity of the facility to a waterfront location in the case of a functionally dependent facility  f the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use  g the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and for that area  h the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  i the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site and  j the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges 4 upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result conditions for variances 1 variances shall be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary considering the flood hazard  and in the instance of a historical building a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building 2 variances shall only be issued upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause {ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship  and iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisance cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 3 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance and that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property 68 4 the building official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request 1 article i purpose authority and jurisdiction a purpose land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development once land has been cut up into streets lots and blocks and publicly recorded the correction of the defects is costly and difficult subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided the welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects it is therefore to the interest of the public the developer and the future owners that subdivision be conceived designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards the following subdivision standards guiding the planning commission are designed to provide for the harmonious development of the planning region to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision for traffic and also to secure adequate provision for light air recreation transportation water drainage and sewer and other sanitary facilities b authority these subdivision regulations are adopted and may be amended under authority granted by tennessee the planning commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in these statutes as prerequisite to the adoption of such standards having a certified copy of the major street and road plan in the office of the register of roane county tennessee on  c jurisdiction these regulations shall govern all subdivisions of land within the harriman planning region as established by resolution of the tennessee state planning commission within these regulations the term subdivision shall mean the division of a tract or parcel of land into two 2 or more lots sites or divisions for the purpose whether immediate or future of sale or building development and includes resubdivision and when appropriate to the context relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or are subdivided any owner of land within this area wishing to subdivide land shall submit to the planning commission a plat of the subdivision according to the procedures outlined in which plat shall conform to the minimum requirements set forth in improvements shall be installed as required by of these standards all property meeting the definition of subdivision which lies within the corporate limits of harriman tennessee in accordance with 134301 tennessee the following divisions of property are considered to be subdivisions and therefore must meet the provisions of these regulations a division where one 1 or more of the resulting lots is less than five 5 acres in size  divisions where a new means of access or public water or public sewer is required regardless of the size of any or all of the lots  further division of lots 2 created by previous subdivision activity  and
