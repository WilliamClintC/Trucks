either discontinued or reduced mitigated planning commission may approve then new panhandle lot without conditions for discontinuance or mitigation if it deems the conditionss would not promote reasonable compatibility with the neighborhood or would not be economically feasible under the circumstances no building permit shall be issued of the panhandle lot unless adequate assurance is provided to the city that all conditions imposed by the planning commission will be met g criteria for panhandle dwellings planning commission shall approve the development of a dwelling on a panhandle lot only if the proposed plan meets the following criteria 1 the architectural review officer shall review the application including the architectural plans to ensure that the proposed new

approve the creation of any proposed panhandle lot andor dwelling the planning commission shall consider each of the following conditions if the planning commission determines by a majority vote of the members attending the meeting that one or more of the conditions set forth below exist then such vote shall also constitute a decision of the planning commission to deny approval of the application for a panhandle lot madeira  land usage chapter 150 zoning 2 1 considering the lots structures building topography and uses of real estate in proximity to the proposed panhandle and the front lot the application does not depict a future development that is significantly compatible with surrounding areas  2 the natural or existing surface water drainage will likely be altered increased retained or diverted to such an extent that an adverse impact to other properties or to any public rightsofway will probably occur under some circumstances  3 the height elevation orientation location or architectural features of any proposed building or structure intended to be placed on either a panhandle or a front lot is unreasonably inconsistent with the orientation location or architectural features of existing buildings or structures in the vicinity  4 the location of the access point the length the width or the grade of a proposed driveway presents features that are not consistent with safety in any and all weather or will cause the creation of an impervious drivewayparking surface that will cover such a large area of open ground or require removal of significant trees or other landscaping that existing green spaces will suffer excessive reduction  5 proposed grading of site proposed walls fences terraces or the proposed location of other structures or buildings will unreasonably interfere with natural topographic patterns which contribute to the appearance of the existing site  and 6 the proposed panhandle lot if created would

purpose 1 a it is the intent of the special public interest transitional district hereinafter referred to as t district to designate a sensitive transitional area of the city for certain types of controlled development which development is consistent with the goals of the city as set forth herein the request for approval of a transitional district development plan within a t district may only be approved if it is initiated or authorized by the madeira  land usage chapter 150 zoning 2 property owners the area of t district is set forth on exhibit a attached to passed  b contrary to conventional development control strictly by type of use the t district provides a more flexible instrument which governs development by the criteria of intensity and impacts of a use rather than its general nature the meaning of use is intended to encompass both the activity intended and permitted to take place on the property as well as the improvements including structures landscaping mounding detention and drainage areas and parking intended or planned for the site as an alternative to the use of a property strictly in accordance with the underlying district designated for the parcel this allows for different types of compatible land use within the zone designated as a t district c the creation of the t district is meant to identify an area exhibit a within the city in which the planning commission may approve approve with modifications or deny specific detailed plans proposed by the property owner the transitional district development plan which meets the criteria established for the t district 2 the specific purposes of the t district are a to provide adequate buffering for the protection of residential districts from the adverse impacts of less restrictive uses which may be permitted in a t district  b to protect and enhance the environmental cultural aesthetic and historic assets of the community planning in the design and arrangement of buildings activities preservation of open or green space and the optimal utilization of natural site features  c to permit the creation of a transitional zone within the city that will provide for the orderly transition from an existing residence a district to the south to less restrictive districts located to the north of the transitional district this must be done in a manner that promotes harmony within the t district as well as providing transition between surrounding districts  and d to reconcile the existing different uses that are in place at the inception of the t district so that the long term value of the property within the district is enhanced without unreasonable harm occurring to the existing activities consideration shall be given to permitting reasonable residential use of the existing dwellings to continue b definitions for the purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning t district the district designated by council on the zoning map and attached to passed  as exhibit a and adopted in accordance with this code the t district is an overlay district which is superimposed upon the

overlay district by council superimposed on specific areas of a residential b district designated on exhibit a attached to passed  this specific t district is designed to address zoning issues in this location and is not intended to be applicable to other areas unless the zoning amended in accordance with the procedures set forth in the charter of the city d permitted buildings uses and other regulations madeira  land usage chapter 150 zoning 2 1 as a matter of right those buildings and uses permitted in the underlying residential b district shall be permitted in accordance with all applicable regulations of that underlying district until such time as buildings and uses authorized by a t district development plan are approved thereafter only those buildings and uses approved for a t district development plan shall be valid on the property the transition from original use to t district use shall be in accordance with the time table approved as part of the t district application failure to complete the improvements and obtain a final certificate of occupancy within the approved time frame including any authorized extensions shall cause the approval of the t district development plan to lapse and only buildings and uses permitted in the underlying district shall be permitted thereafter 2 the following buildings and uses shall only be permitted pursuant to a t district development plan subject to review and approval in accordance with the provisions of this chapter a offices for professional use such as attorneys doctors architects dentists and

permitted if approved by the planning commission as being consistent with the purposes and provisions of this chapter 4 all plans for the uses permitted in the t district shall be prepared to maximize buffering of adjacent districts to the south east and west additional trees and plantings shall be part of the landscaping plans based on consideration of the view from those adjoining districts the overall intent and focus of the final plan is to encourage the uses listed above but to minimize the visual impact to adjacent residential districts in that regard parking for such businesses should where feasible be designed for the front side of such buildings on the camargo road madeira  land usage chapter 150 zoning 2 side of the t district development architectural features which resemble or emphasize a residential look of buildings shall be required as approved by the aro and shall satisfy the specific requirements set forth in division e below common drives and access points to camargo road should be considered e standards for t district development plan review and approval 1 the active use of property and the design of the buildings in the t district shall only be approved if it meets the following general conditions as determined by planning commission a the active use and design do not significantly create an adverse influence on any abutting or surrounding properties  b the plan provides for an orderly transition from more restrictive residential to less restrictive districts  c the plan is designed to maximize the public interest and private benefit in a balanced manner  and d the plan permits and encourages improved development within the remaining sites in the t district 2 specific requirements and standards that must be clearly set forth in a t district development plan before it may be approved are as follows a architectural features shall incorporate such characteristics as are normally associated with singlefamily residential homes including the following exterior construction shall be similar to typical residential construction in such combination as approved by the aro as being consistent in character with surrounding residential areas the side of a building facing camargo road may differ in appearance for example it may be predominately glass  gabled or hipped roofs shall be required no flat roofs  the height of new buildings shall be limited to 35 feet consistent with other residential structures in the city  air conditioning units and waste disposal dumpsters must be specifically shielded by suitable fencinglandscaping as determined to be reasonable by the aro for purposes of shielding these items from adjacent residential areas these requirements shall not apply to an existing residential building which is converted to an office use provided the exterior features of the residential structure including air conditioning and other exterior equipment are maintained b a rear yard setback of 100 feet shall be maintained from the residential district located adjacent to the t district as depicted on exhibit a attached to passed  no structures including parking areas or driveways shall be placed within this 100foot setback area c new parking areas shall be placed where practical and feasible between the building and camargo road parking areas which must be placed to the side or rear of the buildings shall be softened by the placement of landscaping islands in order to reduce the visual mass of impervious surface and parked motor vehicles the number of madeira  land usage chapter 150 zoning 2 parking spaces required shall be four spaces per 1000 square feet of floor area of the building excluding areas devoted exclusively to mechanical physical plant equipment storage or common hallways however shared parking areas may be permitted if it is determined by the planning commission that the overall coverage of impervious areas could be reduced it would enhance the green areas available on the development plan and would permit the new building to be erected closer to camargo road the city is attempting to minimize required parking surfaces while ensuring that there is adequate parking d impervious surfaces shall not cover more than 70% of an area within the entirety of a t district development plan the required 100foot setback area of each lot is included in the t district development plan therefore in calculating the percentage of the area in the development plan that impervious surface will cover the green area within the 100foot setback shall be included as part of the total area of the plan impervious surface shall include all areas of ground within the development plan designated as a parking area but not including landscape islands buildings structures driveways and walkways e evergreen landscaping within the 100foot buffer area that is of sufficient height to block the line of sight view of any parking areas located in the rear or side of any building to be used in a t district development plan mounding may be included as part of the line of sight screening the line of sight shall be from a tenfoot height located in all points along the residential property line which abuts the t district development f no development plan shall be approved which incorporates a proposed property lines the primary purpose of which appears to be avoiding the requirements imposed by this chapter g exterior lighting shall be kept low and shall be reasonably shielded from adjacent residential districts h development plan shall provide a written acknowledgment that all landscaping screening mounding buffering structures drives and parking areas and buildings shall be maintained in first class condition and that failure to so maintain these items shall be a violation of this zoning enforceable in all ways available in law and equity as any other violation of the city zoning 3 no uses in addition to those permitted in the underlying zoning shall be permitted unless the developer demonstrates compliance with each of the above standards to the satisfaction of the planning commission 4 to secure the application of all relevant standards to a development in a t district the planning commission shall require that the following are specifically set forth in any t district development plan a front side and rear yard requirements density requirements height and bulk of building requirements and intensity of use  no minimum setbacks are required to be included in the development plan except there shall be sufficient setback for necessary madeira  land usage chapter 150 zoning 2 screening and that the 100foot setback depicted on exhibit a attached to passed  shall be maintained  b the use of materials

approve the t district development plan as submitted approve a modified plan with conditions or madeira  land usage chapter 150 zoning 2 deny approval of the plan five members of planning commission must vote in the affirmative to approve any such application either as submitted or modified approval of this plan shall be considered approval of a preliminary t district development plan approval of the preliminary development plan shall not constitute any authority to proceed with construction or development such approval shall only authorize the applicant to submit a proposed final development plan c a proposed final t district development plan shall be submitted within six months of the date of the planning commission meeting at which the preliminary plan was approved the planning commission may extend this period for a reasonable period upon a showing of good cause by the applicant the final plan must be substantially consistent with the preliminary plan in all respects if the

to determine whether proposed construction including renovation repair maintenance or other similar activities shall be reviewed administratively as an essentially minor application or by planning commission a preapplication meeting is recommended with the city manager or his or her designee to determine the submission requirements see division b5 below a review the city manager or his or her designee shall review the proposed construction and shall consult with the architectural review officer aro before he or she makes the decision whether the proposed construction is essentially minor b essentially minor designation construction shall be deemed designated essentially minor if it when completed will have primarily preserved the use function form scale and accessory uses that existed prior to the construction madeira  land usage chapter 167 residentialscale business overlay district regulations 289 77227432 c stage 1a determination of modification type the following factors shall be weighed and considered in determining whether the construction is essentially minor i will the proposed construction significantly alter the exterior appearance of the existing building or site design in one or more of the following ways a height  b setbacks  c footprint  d entrance  e fenestration  f envelope volume  g exterior materials or colors  and h landscaping or parking ii will the construction essentially preserve the form and use of the existing building and site iii is the estimated cost of the construction to the exterior of the building and site sufficient to justify that the modifications be compatible with the purpose  16703 of the residentialscale business overlay district regulations d stage 1b determination of modification magnitude i for the city manager or his or her designee to determine that a project is essentially minor management must find that a the construction will not increase the dimensions of a building or structure by more than 10% of the square footage of the existing building or structure exclusive of the alteration or expansion  b the project will not involve additional land other than the lot of record  c the cost of the exterior renovation of the structure does not exceed 25% of the assessed value of the building or structure to be altered prior to the renovations  and d the alterations do not require dimensional variances from the regulations of this chapter madeira  land usage chapter 167 residentialscale business overlay district regulations 290 77227432 ii if the city manager or his or her designee determines that the construction is essentially minor he or she shall so certify in writing a file containing the certification copies of the proposed construction and staff comments and recommendations shall be assembled and retained for not less than five years after completion of the proposed construction iii for the purposes of this chapter it shall be presumed that any additional construction proposed
