following floodplain management regulations as written were approved in draft form by the chief engineer of the division of water resources of the kansas department of agriculture on  bkansas statutory authorization the legislature of the state of kansas has in ksa 12741 et seq and specifically in ksa 12766 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare therefore the governing body of the city of tonganoxie ordains as follows    16302 findings of fact aflood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of tonganoxie kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bgeneral causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages cmethods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this article uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this article is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this article the base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one foot at any point 4delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood      16303 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in section 16302a  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 cfr 5922a3  and to meet the requirements of 44 cfr 603d and kar 5444 by applying the provisions of this article to arestrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  and brequire uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  and cprotect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard    general provisions 16304 lands to which article applies this article shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of tonganoxie identified as numbered and unnumbered a zones ae ao and ah zones on the index map dated  of the flood insurance rate map firm as amended and any future revisions thereto in all

safeguards and restrictions as the city of tonganoxie or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare health of the inhabitants of the

structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations    16306 abrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this article to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this article imposes greater restrictions the provisions of this article shall prevail all other ordinances

to be minimum requirements shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by kansas statutes    16308 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this article does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage this article shall not create a liability on the part of the city of tonganoxie any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder    16309 severability if any
