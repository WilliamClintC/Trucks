possible consistent with the costs involved it is the belief of this municipality that it is preferable to attempt to prevent losses before considering other techniques for handling loss exposures the reduction of losses depends primarily upon a careful review of all operations equipment and facilities to identify potential hazards and to eliminate or reduce them to their practical minimum this

to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities  by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise

received within twentyfour 24 hours 4 bypass is prohibited and the director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and iii the user submitted notices as required under paragraph 3 of this section 5 the director may approve an
