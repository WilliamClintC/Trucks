property classified in the t zone by the map adopted pursuant to be developed for any use which is permitted in any other zone subject to the provisions of    purpose the purpose of the provisions of this chapter is to provide for an interim transitional zone classification for certain properties for the reasons set forth in this chapter    findings the city council finds determines and declares as follows a that the citys staff and planning commission have recommended that former zone classifications of p and r2p should be eliminated and abolished  b that the determination was made as a result of staff and commission studies made as a part of the commissions recommendation relating to the revision of the citys zoning regulations and zoning map  c that there are approximately two hundred ninety parcels which are classified in either p or r2p zones as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter  d that the commission has initiated studies to determine the appropriate zone classification of each parcel so zoned  e that due to the number of parcels included with the zones each study cannot be completed in less than four to six months  f that pending the completion and classification of such properties in appropriate zone designation it is essential that the properties be placed in a transitional zone to permit the adoption of the new zoning regulations and map which will allow the development of such properties on a parcelbyparcel basis upon application and receipt of a conditional use permit for any use sought to be placed on any of the certain parcels  g that many of the properties now zoned in either the p or r2p zones are in fact in a transitional state and the classification and future use thereof will be determined in part by the classification placed on property immediately adjacent thereto and other planning considerations  h that the only feasible way to permit development of the properties pending the final review and study of the appropriate zone classification is by means of the enactment of the provisions of this chapter requiring a conditional use permit for any development of the properties  i that by reason of the notice given with reference to the planning commission hearing relating to revised zoning regulations and the zoning map the properties now classified in zone p or zone r2p could as a part of the review be reclassified by adoption of a revised zoning map the planning commission and council determined that separate reclassification proceedings were appropriate as to such properties to insure that the views of the owners of such properties could be considered and evaluated  j that the public interest convenience and necessity require enactment of the provisions of this chapter and its application to the properties referred to in this section k in addition to the findings above set forth the city council finds and determines that with respect to properties which are located adjacent to railroad rightsofway because of the unique characteristics of such properties and the relationship of such properties to contiguous properties traditional zoning does not function so as to allow the reasonable use of such properties consistent and compatible with adjacent properties as to such properties the t zone will provide a vehicle so as to permit proper and reasonable development of such properties  1986 prior code  9501   applicability the provisions of this chapter shall apply to each of those properties which are designated on the zoning map adopted by the letter t any

and intent the purpose of the provisions of this chapter is to preserve and enhance the architectural and historic integrity of the historic district no 1 also known as the hadleygreenleaf historic neighborhood and to ensure that any new development or alterations to existing structures in the district are compatible with the historic fabric of the district  part 1998   historic district defined the following characteristics define historic district no 1 a boundaries the boundaries of the historic district are defined as follows on the east lots fronting onto painter avenue along the east side of the street south to the north side of hadley street and north to the south side of broadway as illustrated in the accompanying map on the west the east side of greenleaf avenue extending south to the north side of hadley street and extending north to the south side of broadway on the north the south side of broadway extending west to the east side of greenleaf avenue and extending east to the properties fronting along the east side of painter avenue on the south the north side of hadley street extending west to the east side of greenleaf avenue and extending east to those lots fronting the east side of painter avenue b historic characteristics the features of the historic district no 1 which define its historic significance and the character of the area to be preserved include 1 land use historic district no 1 is a residential neighborhood originally the area was a singlefamily residential neighborhood and many of the original singlefamily homes remain some have been converted to multifamily use and some older homes have been replaced with new multifamily structures however the land use in the area is predominantly residential 2 architectural styles historic district no 1 includes examples of a variety of architectural styles including victorian cottages see exhibit 1 spanish or mediterranean revival exhibit 2 and modern structures however the predominant style is the craftsman bungalow exhibits 3 and 4 this style is characterized by buildings with gabled rather than flat roofs extended eaves with exposed rafters use of natural materials wood stone brick and an effort to tie the interior space to the environment inclusion of many windows wide doors or french doors porches and balconies and extensive landscaping 3 scale the scale of the structures which are over fifty years old is smaller than the more modern buildings buildings are generally two stories or less and cover less than half of the lot on which they are located there is a substantial amount of landscaped open space between structures exhibit 5 shows the scale of development on a typical street and exhibit 6 shows typical street landscaping 4 landscaping the landscaping of both private property and public rightsofway is extensive and mature the impression is of a wooded area with buildings tucked into the landscaping landscaping plans are informal and imitate nature as was common in the era when craftsman bungalows were constructed exhibit 7 is an example of the lush landscaping common in the area 5 public improvements public improvements in the area include paved local streets with curbs gutters and sidewalks separated from the street by a landscaped median each street has a mixture of street trees rather than a single type older streetlight fixtures remain along painter avenue but the rest of the area is served by lights attached to utility poles exhibit 8 illustrates the older streetlight style  part 1998   permitted uses land uses permitted in the historic district no 1 shall be those permitted in the underlying zone provided the construction or operation of such use is compatible with the requirements of this chapter in addition to such principal permitted uses accessory uses permitted by the underlying zone classification shall also be allowed  part 1998   development standards no plan for development alteration expansion or construction on properties located in the historic district shall be approved unless the same complies with the following development standards a site and setting if a property owner or a developer intends to utilize a historic resource as part of a development he should consider the context of the resources original site and the importance of the setting in the proposed development 1 in some instances a resource will occupy the full site and limit development opportunities to rehabilitation renovation or restoration for adaptive reuse 2 in instances where a resource occupies less than the full site greater flexibility will be available for new development that incorporates the resource into the project except that all new development alteration or expansion of existing structures shall maintain the required lot coverage and setbacks of the underlying zone b building height all new development or alteration or expansion of existing structures shall comply with the height limits of the underlying zone height of all structures at street level should be visually compatible with adjacent buildings use of setbacks at upper levels may be permitted to achieve maximum utilization of a property compatible with the appearance of the area c density and intensity of development the maximum dwelling unit density or building intensity permitted in the historic district shall be that permitted by the underlying zone so long as the resulting development is appropriate to the neighborhood the apparent physical size scale and height of all structures should relate to existing resources without overwhelming them exhibit 5 illustrates the range of height and scale existing in the area d offstreet parking the offstreet parking requirements for all development in historic district shall be those established for the underlying zone e design guidelines in considering whether a proposed development is compatible with the historic character of historic district no 1 property owners developers city staff historic resources commission and council members shall be guided by the following 1 proportion of openings the width and height of windows doors and entries should be visually compatible with buildings structures public ways and places in the surrounding area a long unbroken facade or small widelyspaced windows is not appropriate wooden doublehung or casement windows are typical of the area often placed in groups of two or more examples of the types of windows and doors and their placement in the facade can be seen in exhibits 1 2 3 4 9 and 10 the relationship of solid spaces ie walls to voids ie windows and doors in the facade of a building or structure should be visually compatible with buildings structures and public ways in the surrounding area 2 rhythm of spacing of buildings or structures on the street the relationship of a building or structure to the open space between it and adjoining buildings or structures should respect the surrounding environment the building mass of large architectural projects can be varied in form using setbacks for open space and landscaping when appropriate to provide necessary visual transitions between a lawn new building and the adjacent historic resources see exhibits 5 and 6 3 porches and entryways the relationship of entrances and other projections to sidewalks should be designed with the street scene provided by existing buildings structures and public ways as a guide to ensure that they are visually related examples of the types of porches and entries typical to the historic district are shown in exhibits 1 2 3 4 11 and 12 4 relationship of materials texture and color the relationship of materials texture and color of the facade of a building or structure should be chosen with the predominant materials used in existing buildings or structures in mind paint colors are exempt from review however colors of natural materials should be considered the choice of exterior colors and material textures should be tempered by the predominant colors and textures of the surrounding area in general the use of manmade materials metal plastic in facades should be limited because the majority of the historic structures in the historic district use natural materials and specifically wood brick or stone simplicity in the use of materials textures and colors is preferable exhibits 13 14 and 15 illustrate typical wood shingles and siding found on homes in the area 5 roof shapes the roof shape of a building is a major distinguishing visual element in most cases a simple roof form similar to that of the existing historic resources in the area should be used most homes in the area have pitched rather than flat roofs and the typical roofing material is composition shingle examples of rooflines typical of the area are shown in exhibits 1 2 3 4 16 17 and 18 notice that the roofline is frequently broken by dormers 6 design of accessory structures the proposed project should take into account the compatibility of landscaping fences and walls parking facilities utility and service areas walkways and other accessory structures these should be designed with the overall environment in mind and should be in visual keeping with related buildings structures and places 7 landscaping all mature trees removed to make way for new construction or alteration of an existing structure should be replaced with large box size trees of a type typical to the area and similar in form to the tree removed landscaping should be similar in design and type of plants used to that which occurs typically in the area exhibits 6 and 7 illustrate typical planting configurations in the area  part 1998   certificate of appropriateness required upon adoption of the historic
