having taken legislative notice of the evidence of conduct occurring in and around adult entertainment businesses located in other jurisdictions which the council hereby deems to be relevant to the experience in covington as reported in judicial opinions including but not limited to kev inc v kitsap county 793 f2d 1053 9th cir 1986 ino ino inc v city of bellevue 132 wn2c 103 1997 dcr inc v

ordinances regulating adult entertainment businesses including but not limited to the counties of king kitsap pierce snohomish and spokane and the cities of bellevue bothell everett federal way kent lake forest park redmond renton seattle shoreline and tukwila 1the operation of adult entertainment businesses has historically and regularly been accompanied by secondary effects that are detrimental to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of covington such secondary effects include significant criminal activity and activities injurious to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the community detrimental effects on nearby businesses and residential areas and a decline in property values in the area of the adult entertainment businesses this history of criminal and injurious activity includes prostitution narcotics and liquor law violations breaches of the peace assaults employment or involvement of minors sexual conduct between customers or between customers and entertainers the opportunity for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and the presence within the industry of individuals with hidden ownership interests and outstanding arrest warrants accordingly there is a compelling need and interest to regulate adult entertainment businesses as provided in this chapter to protect and promote the public health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of covington  2these activities occur regardless of whether adult entertainment is presented in conjunction with the sale of alcoholic beverages  3the resources available for responding to problems associated with adult entertainment businesses are limited and are most efficiently and effectively utilized licensing and regulatory program  4the license fees required in this chapter are necessary as reasonable fees imposed to help defray the costs of processing the license applications and the substantial expenses incurred by covington in regulating the adult entertainment industry  5adult entertainment businesses have historically engaged in practices that involve secreting ownership interests for such purposes as money laundering skimming profits and tax evasion these hidden ownership interests have on occasion been held by individuals and entities reputed to be involved in organized crime to detect and discourage the involvement of organized crime in the adult entertainment industry to effectively deploy its limited law enforcement resources and to effectively protect the public health safety morals and general welfare of its citizenry the city must be fully apprised of the actual and controlling interests of adult entertainment businesses and the identities and criminal backgrounds of persons responsible for he management and control of such businesses  6to detect and discourage the involvement of organized crime in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors to assure the correct identification of persons working in adult entertainment businesses to effectively deploy its limited law enforcement resources and to effectively protect the public health safety morals and general welfare of its citizenry the city must be fully apprised of the identity age and criminal background of managers in adult entertainment businesses  7it is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of an adult entertainment business during all hours of operation so there will be a person responsible for the overall operation of the business including the actions of customers entertainers and other employees to monitor the actions of these individuals a manager must be able to observe these individuals at all times  8to prevent the exploitation of minors to assure the correct identification of persons working in adult entertainment businesses to effectively deploy its limited law enforcement resources and to effectively protect the public health safety morals and general welfare of its citizenry the city must be fully apprised of the identity age and criminal background of entertainers in adult clubs  9proximity between entertainers and customers in adult clubs facilitates sexual conduct prostitution transactions involving controlled substances and other crimes to deter such conduct and assist law enforcement in detecting it king county before city incorporation has historically required that an entertainer exposing nudity must be separated from customers by performing on a stage at least 18 inches above the floor and at least six feet from the nearest patron and has prohibited entertainers from engaging in sexual conduct  10there is substantial evidence that such prohibitions are ineffective entertainers in adult clubs perform offstage erotic performances variously referred to as table couch or lap dances which typically involve exposure of nudity or sexual conduct between entertainers and customers or both and may also include acts of prostitution transactions involving controlled substances and other crimes to effectively deter such conduct and assist law enforcement in detecting it it is necessary that all erotic performances in an adult club occur on a stage which is at least 10 feet from the nearest customer such a requirement is in effect in the city of kent kitsap county and pierce county and has been upheld as a constitutional regulation that furthers the governmental interest in preventing sexual conduct and other criminal conduct while still allowing an entertainer to convey an erotic expression see colacurcio v city of kent 163 f3d 545 9th cir 1998 kev inc v kitsap county 793 f2d 1053 9th cir 1986 and dcr inc v pierce county 92 wnapp 660 1998 respectively 11to prevent sexual conduct from occurring between entertainers and customers customers must be prohibited from any stage where adult entertainment occurs and be prohibited from passing tips gratuities or other payments directly to entertainers performing on stage 12adult entertainment businesses have historically attempted to prevent law enforcement and licensing officials from detecting sexual conduct prostitution sale and distribution of controlled substances and other violations of law occurring on the premises by employing warning systems maintaining a low level of lighting and other techniques it is necessary to effectively enforce this chapter and to protect the public health safety morals and general welfare of the citys citizenry that adult entertainment businesses be required to maintain a minimum level of lighting that warning devices and systems be prohibited and that unannounced inspections be permitted by city licensing and law enforcement personnel  13adult arcades provide booths for individual viewing of live performances videos and films distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on nudity or sexual conduct existing standards of conduct and facility specifications have not deterred customers from engaging in sexual conduct in such businesses to detect and deter such conduct to require maintenance of clean and sanitary conditions and to reduce the potential for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases it is necessary to regulate the configuration and facility specifications of adult arcades as set forth in this chapter including but not limited to restricting the occupancy of a booth to one person  14an adult arcade might attempt to circumvent the limit of one person per booth by creating a small room labeled minitheater rather than a booth in which two three or a small number of individuals would be able to view videos and films distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on nudity or sexual conduct moreover traditionalsized theaters might also show such videos or films customers have used both traditional adult theaters and minitheaters within arcades as places to engage in sexual conduct existing standards of conduct and facility specifications have not deterred customers from engaging in sexual conduct in these businesses to detect and deter such conduct and reduce the potential for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases it is necessary to regulate the configuration and facility specifications as set forth in this chapter of spaces used by more than one individual to view adult entertainment in particular it is necessary to require that any group viewing area for such videos and films have a minimum of eight seats which may be accessed by customers without reservation in order to prevent or diminish a sense of privacy and intimacy which would be conducive to and enabling of sexual conduct between customers  15to assure that minors are not subjected to adult entertainment it is necessary to prohibit adult entertainment businesses from allowing adult entertainment performances or pictorial representations of adult entertainment performances displaying nudity or sexual conduct from being visible from outside the business  and 16to discourage customers of bars and other alcoholserving businesses from moving to adult entertainment businesses at  am for after hours activities and the increased likelihood of breaches of the peace and other criminal conduct that arise from those customers and to reduce the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses on minors and the community it is necessary to restrict the closing time of adult entertainment businesses   purpose and intent it is the purpose of this chapter to establish licensing operational and facility standards for adult entertainment businesses located in the city of covington to promote and protect the health safety morals and general welfare of covingtons residents this chapter is intended to prevent the secondary effects that have historically and regularly accompanied the operation of adult entertainment businesses including but not limited to the incidence of prostitution sexual conduct with the opportunity for transmission of sexually transmitted diseases employment or involvement of minors violation of controlled substance and alcoholic beverage laws assaults breaches of the peace and the

construction the program may contract for services with interested municipalities or special districts including but not limited to sewer and water districts school districts port districts or other governmental agencies       purpose it is the finding of the city that the surface water management program is necessary in order to promote public health safety and welfare by establishing and operating a comprehensive approach to surface and stormwater problems which would reduce flooding erosion and sedimentation prevent and mitigate habitat loss enhance groundwater recharge and prevent water quality degradation this comprehensive approach includes the following elements basin planning land use regulation construction of facilities maintenance public education and provision of surface and stormwater management services it is the finding of the city that the most cost effective and beneficial approach to surface and stormwater management is actions and protection of the natural drainage system in approaching surface and stormwater problems the surface water management program shall give priority to methods which provide protection or enhancement of the natural surface water drainage system over means which primarily involve construction of new drainage facilities or systems the purpose of the rates and charges established herein is to provide a method for payment of all or any part of the cost and expense of surface and stormwater management services or to pay or secure the payment of all or any portion of any issue of general obligation or revenue bonds issued for such services these rates and charges are necessary in order to promote the public health safety and welfare by minimizing uncontrolled surface and stormwater erosion and water pollution to preserve and utilize the many values of the citys natural drainage system including water quality open space fish and wildlife habitat recreation education urban separation and drainage facilities and to provide for the comprehensive management and administration of surface and stormwater   applicability developed parcels within the service area shall be billed each year for surface and stormwater management services pursuant to rcw    policy 1many of the difficulties found in the management of surface and stormwater problems are contributed to by the general lack of public knowledge about the relationship between human actions and surface and stormwater management in order to achieve a comprehensive approach to surface and stormwater management the city should provide general information to the public about land use and human activities which impact surface and stormwater management school districts can provide significant benefits to the city regarding surface and stormwater management programs and community activities related to protection and enhancement of the surface and stormwater management system these programs and activities can provide students with an understanding of human activities and land use practices that create surface and stormwater problems and involve students by learning from first hand exposure the difficulties of resolving surface and stormwater management problems after they occur 2it is the finding of the city that developed parcels contribute to an increase in surface and stormwater runoff to the surface and stormwater management system this increase in surface and stormwater runoff results in the need to establish rates and charges to finance the citys activities in surface and stormwater management developed parcels shall be subject to the rates and charges of the surface water management program based on their contribution to increased runoff the factors to be used to determine the degree of increased surface and stormwater runoff to the surface and stormwater management system from a particular parcel shall be the percentage of impervious surface coverage on the parcel and the total acreage of the parcel 3it is the finding of the city of covington that undeveloped parcels do not contribute as much as developed parcels to an increase in surface and stormwater runoff into the surface and stormwater management system undeveloped properties shall be exempt from the rates and charges of the surface water management program 4it is the finding of the city that maintained drainage facilities mitigates the increased runoff contribution of developed parcels by providing onsite drainage control parcels served by retentiondetention facilities which were required for development of the parcel or can be demonstrated as required by the property owner to provide detentionretention of surface and stormwater to the standards in cmc shall receive a discount as provided in the rates and charges of the surface water management program if the facility is maintained at the parcel owners expense to the standard established by the department that portion of the rates or charges allocated for payment of debt service on revenue or general obligation bonds issued to finance stormwater control facilities will not be discounted for retentiondetention facilities 5open space properties provide a benefit to the surface and stormwater management system by the retention of property in an undeveloped state open space properties shall receive a discount from the rates and charges to encourage the retention of property as open space 6the majority of the parcels in the service area are residential the variance between residential parcels in impervious surface coverage is relatively minor and reflect only minor differences in increased runoff contributions the administrative cost of calculating the service charge individually for each residential parcel and maintaining accurate information would be very high a flat charge for residential parcels is less costly to administer than calculating a separate charge for each parcel and is equitable because of the similarities in impervious surface coverage between residential parcels therefore residential parcels shall be charged a flat charge based upon an average amount of impervious surface 7very lightly developed nonresidential parcels which have an impervious surface coverage of 10 percent or less of the total parcel acreage are characterized by a very low intensity of development and generally encompass a large number of acres a greater number of acres of undeveloped land associated with an impervious surface results in significantly less impact to the surface and stormwater management system these parcels shall be charged a flat rate which will encourage the retention of large areas of very lightly developed land 8lightly to very heavily developed nonresidential parcels which have an impervious surface coverage of more than 10 percent have a substantial impact on the surface and stormwater management system the impact of these parcels on the surface and stormwater management system increases with the size of the parcels therefore lightly to very heavily developed properties shall be charged a rate determined by the percent of impervious surface coverage multiplied by the parcel acreage 9the city roads and state highway programs provide substantial annual programs for the construction and maintenance of drainage facilities and the roads systems and their associated drainage facilities serve as an integral part of the surface and stormwater management system city and state road drainage systems unlike the drainage systems on other properties are continually being upgraded to increase both conveyance capacity and control it is envisioned that the roads program will work cooperatively with the surface water management program to improve regional surface and stormwater management services as new information is available from basin plans and other sources city roads and state highways shall not be charged a rate in recognition of the benefit to the stormwater management services provided by the drainage facilities associated with the city roads and state highway programs  provided that those drainage facilities are constructed operated and maintained in accordance with this chapter 10comprehensive management of surface and stormwater runoff must include anticipation of future growth and development in the design and improvement of the surface and stormwater management system service charge revenue needs shall be based upon the present and future requirements of the surface and stormwater management system and these needs shall be considered when determining the rates and charges of the program 11basin plans are essential to establishing a comprehensive approach to a capital improvement program maintenance of facilities and regulation of new developments a plan should analyze the measures needed to control surface and stormwater runoff which results from existing and anticipated development within the basin a plan also should recommend the quantity and water quality runoff control measures required to further the purposes set forth in this chapter and community goals the institutional requirements and regulations including but not limited to land use management funding needs and incentives for preserving the natural surface water drainage system should be identified in the plan the proposed ordinances and regulations necessary to implement the plan shall be transmitted to the city council simultaneously with the plan 12areas with development related surface and stormwater problems require comprehensive management of surface and stormwater 13additional surface and stormwater runoff problems may be caused by new land use development if not properly mitigated both of natural systems and improvements the stormwater manuals and this chapter have been adopted by the city of covington to mitigate the impact of land use development further mitigation of these impacts is based on expertise which continues to evolve as new information on our natural systems is obtained and new techniques are discovered the surface water management program studies basin plans and other special studies will continuously provide valuable information on the existing problems and areas of the natural drainage system that need special protection the city has researched comprehensive plan development process methods to protect the natural drainage system buffering and setbacks to alleviate existing problems setback and buffering measures allow natural preservation of wetlands and stream corridors to occur alleviate erosion and water pollution and provide a safe environment for the small mammals and fish which inhabit sensitive areas based upon the findings in this subsection and as information and methods become available the director as appropriate will draft and submit to the council regulations and development standards to allow protection of the surface and stormwater management system including natural drainage systems 14the program will maintain longterm fiscal viability and fund solvency for all of its related funds the programs approach to financial reporting and disclosure will be comprehensive open and accessible 15the program shall prepare an annual multiyear capital improvement program which encompasses all of the programs activities related to the acquisition construction replacement or renovation of capital facilities or equipment the programs capital facilities will be planned and financed to ensure that the benefits of the facilities and the costs for them are balanced over time 16longterm debt will not be used to support operating expenses     rate structure 1the service charges shall be based on the relative contribution of increased surface and stormwater runoff from a given parcel to the surface and stormwater management system the percentage of impervious surfaces on the parcel and the total parcel acreage will be used to indicate the relative contribution of increased surface and stormwater runoff from the parcel to the surface and stormwater management system the relative contribution of increased surface and stormwater runoff from each parcel will determine that parcels share of the service charge revenue needs the service charge revenue needs of the program are based upon all or any part as determined by the city council of the cost of surface and stormwater management services or to pay or secure the payment of all or any portion of any issue of bonds issued for that purpose 2the public works department shall determine the service charge for each parcel within the service area by the following methodology residential and very lightly developed nonresidential parcels shall receive a flat rate service charge for the reasons set forth in cmc 7 light to very heavily developed parcels shall be classified into the appropriate rate category by their percentage of impervious surface coverage land use codes or data collected from parcel investigations or both will be used to determine each parcels percentage of impervious surface coverage after a parcel has been assigned to the appropriate rate category the service charge for the parcel will be calculated by multiplying the total acreage of the parcel times the rate for that category 3there are hereby imposed upon all developed properties in the service area annual service charges as set forth in the current fee resolution 4the city council will review the surface water management service charges annually to ensure the longterm fiscal viability of the program and to guarantee that debt covenants are met the program will use equitable and efficient methods to determine service charges amended at request of department 208      rate adjustments and appeals 1any person billed for service charges may file a request for rate adjustment with the department of public works within three years of the date from which the bill was sent however filing of such a request does not extend the period for payment of the charge 2requests for rate adjustment may be granted or approved by the director only when one of the following conditions exists athe parcel is owned and is the personal residence of a person or persons determined by the county assessor as qualified for a lowincome senior citizen property tax exemption authorized under rcw  parcels qualifying under this subsection 2a shall be exempt from all charges imposed in cmc 3  bthe acreage of the parcel charged is in error  cthe parcel is nonresidential and the actual impervious surface coverage of the parcel charged places it in a different rate category than the rate category assigned by the department  dthe parcel is nonresidential and the parcel meets the definition of open space in cmc  parcels qualifying under this subsection 2d will be charged only for the area of impervious surface and at the rate which the parcel is classified under using the total parcel acreage  ethe parcel is served by one or more retentiondetention facilities required pursuant to cmc or can be demonstrated by the property owner to provide detentionretention of surface and stormwater to the standards in cmc and is maintained at the expense of the parcel owner to the standards required by the department nonresidential parcels except in the light category qualifying under this subsection 2e shall be charged at the rate of one lower rate category than it is classified by its percentage of impervious surface coverage nonresidential parcels in the light rate category qualifying under this subsection 2e shall be charged at the rate as outlined in the current fee resolution residential parcels and parcels in the very light category qualifying under this subsection 2e shall be charged a rate as outlined in the current fee resolution  fthe parcel is owned or leased by a public school district which provides activities which directly benefit the surface water management program the activities may include curriculum specific to the issues and problems of surface and stormwater management and student activities in the community to expose students to the efforts required to restore monitor or enhance the surface and stormwater management system the amount of the rate adjustment shall be determined by the director based upon the cost of the activities to the school district but not to exceed the value of the activity to the surface water management program the department will determination which activities qualify for the surface water management service charge reduction reductions in surface water management service charges will only be granted to school districts which provide programs that have been evaluated by the department the rate adjustment for the school district activity may be applied to any parcel in the service area which is owned or operated by the school district  or gthe service charge bill was otherwise not calculated in accordance with this chapter 3the property owner shall have the burden of proving that the rate adjustment sought should be granted 4the applicant shall be notified in writing of the directors decision if an adjustment is granted which reduces the charge for the current year or two prior years the applicant shall be refunded the amount overpaid in the current and two prior years 5if the director finds that a service charge bill has been undercharged then either an amended bill shall be issued which reflects the increase in the service charge or the undercharged amount will be added to the next years bill this amended bill shall be due and payable under cmc  the director may include in the bill the amount undercharged for two previous billing years in addition to the current bill 6decisions of the director on requests for rate adjustments shall be final unless within 30 days of the date the decision was mailed the applicant submits in writing to the director a notice of appeal setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for appeal and requesting a hearing before the city of covington hearing examiner the examiners decision shall be a final decision pursuant to cmc

prior to the billing year and at the rate as set forth in the current fee resolution billing year is the year that the bills are sent the service charge shall be displayed and billed on the annual property tax statement for the parcel and shall be mailed to the name and address shown on the real property tax roll at the time annual property tax bills are prepared parcels which are exempt from property taxes and do not receive an annual property tax statement will receive a bill only for the service charge if a payment less than the sum of the total property tax plus service charge or less than the sum of onehalf of the property tax plus onehalf of the service charge is received for a combined property tax and service charge and the parcel owner has not otherwise specified the finance

early notice and the applicant changed or clarified the proposal to include those specific mitigation measures the city will issue and circulate a dns under wac 197113402 bif the responsible official indicated areas of concern but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a dns the responsible official will make the threshold determination issuing a dns or ds as
