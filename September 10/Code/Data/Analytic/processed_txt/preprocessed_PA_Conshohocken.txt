therefore depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in which to park their own vehicles  b those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air level  and c the establishment of a parking permit program for certain affected areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking preference during certain hours of the day and days of the week therefore the borough considers it to be in the interest of the people of the borough to provide for the establishment of a  15408 conshohocken code  15409  residential permit parking program to insure primary access to available parking spaces by neighborhood residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient air level 2

related to the conveyance of excessive rates and volumes of stormwater runoff further the objectives of stormwater management propose to maintain as nearly as possible natural runoff flow characteristics either by augmenting the infiltration process or by temporarily storing stormwater for release at controlled rates of discharge andor intercepting runoff to reduce accelerated erosion and sedimentation furthermore a stormwater management system shall be provided in order to a permit unimpeded flow of natural watercourses b ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the lines of streets c intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals related to the extent and grade of the area drained d provide positive drainage away from onsite sewage disposal and structures e

appropriate development stages for the drainage system shall be indicated in accordance with pennsylvania department of environmental protections rules and regulations title 25 as last revised 1 all storm sewer design shall be based on the rational formula q   cia where q   rate of flow in cubic feet per second c   runoff coefficient i   intensity of rainfall in inches per hour a   watershed area in acres 2 in setting the value of the runoff coefficient c consideration will be given to the physical features of the drainage basin and the best available data on the future density of development of the drainage basin the value chosen should conform to percentage of runoff vs total rainfall as determined by the soil cover complex method which will be further discussed under detention pond design criteria 3 the intensity of the storm shall be based on a onehundredyearfrequency storm with the inlet time of concentration equal to the storm duration for any given point the inlet time of

be based on the manning equation and shall utilize the n factor of  the minimum allowable pipe size is 18 inches a pipeline submerged 1 this method is based on the assumption that when the storm sewer system is under maximum load the hydraulic gradient will be at or above the crown of the pipe and that flow in the  19102 conshohocken code  19104  lines will be controlled by head differentials between structures or other locations where the system is open to the ground surface such as inlets or outlets manholes and stream inlets and outlets the head of water above the crown of any pipe can range from zero feet to a point which will not cause surface flooding 2 the slope of the hydraulic gradient in any section of storm sewer between openings to the surface shall be calculated on the assumption that the pipe is flowing full at a constant velocity and at the required capacity 3 the elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point in the pipe shall be no lower than the crown of the pipe and no higher than the surface of the ground 4 the elevation of the hydraulic gradient at any point where the system opens to the surface such as an inlet or manhole shall be three feet six inches below the surface of the ground 5 at all structures such as manholes inlets etc where the pipe size does not change the elevation of the hydraulic gradient shall be dropped 02 of a foot to allow for losses therein where the inlet and outlet pipe sizes are not the same the elevation of the hydraulic gradient shall be dropped an amount based on the following formula h   02 feet + 08 d1  d2 where d1   diameter of inlet pipe d2   diameter of outlet pipe if d1 is larger than d2 head loss   02 feet 6 the minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum velocity of 25 feet per second shall be maintained when the pipe is flowing 14 full b pipeline flowing full 1 this method is based on the assumption that the hydraulic gradient will match the inside top of the pipe when the system is under maximum hydraulic load 2 for this method head losses inlets etc shall be ignored 3 the minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum velocity of 25 feet per second shall be maintained when the pipe is flowing 14 full  19104 administration and government  19104  4 when the pipe sizes change the inside tops of the pipes shall be matched 2 profile requirements continuous

capacities shall be in accordance with pennsylvania department of transportation guidelines c the gutter of all inlets shall be set not less than two inches nor more than four inches below the gutter grade the surface of the paving adjacent to the inlets shall be constructed to blend into the lowered gutter grade at the inlet in such a manner that sudden dropoff or dip at the inlet will not be created d where surface water is collected from two directions at one street corner inlets shall be placed at or near the tangent points of both ends of the radius the use of an inlet in the radius shall not be allowed 5 manholes manholes shall be located at intervals of approximately 400 feet where pipe sizes of 24 inches or less are used and 600 feet apart for larger sizes inlets should be substituted for manholes where they will serve a useful purpose manholes or inlets shall be placed at all changes of direction 6 open channel design open channel design should be based on the following hydraulic considerations a mannings equation 1 to determine n factor n    for best concretelined ditch n    for best unlined ditch  19104 conshohocken code  19104  n   003 to 015 for fair to poor natural streams and watercourses 2 allowable velocities excavation material allowable velocity feet per second fine sand and firm loam 250 to 35 stiff clay and hardpan 375 to 60 concretelined ditch 15 b a minimum onefoot to zerofoot freeboard should be provided on all channels at onehundredyear storm flows c the channel should be designed to conform wherever possible to the adjacent average ground conditions this means that it should not be projecting excessively above the surrounding ground or placed excessively below the surrounding ground d continuous profiles for each reach

protection rules and regulations title 25 as last revised 3 the volume of storage provided shall equal the total additional volume of runoff due to development based on a onehundredyear frequency twentyfourhourduration storm the storage required may be based on after construction flows rather than during provided that the development is properly staged or other measures are taken to retard the higher during construction flows an additional storage allowance of 006 acreinches must be provided to compensate for sediment accumulation b discharge piping 1 discharge piping shall be reinforced
