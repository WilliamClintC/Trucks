findings a the purpose of this article is to promote the health safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the city of marathon by establishing a stormwater utility responsible for the financing construction operation and maintenance of stormwater facilities  for stormwater system planning  for coordinated review of development plans for compliance with stormwater regulations  and ensuring the protection and enhancement of the citys nearshore waters further the city finds more specifically that 1 the city is located in the middle of the florida keys archipelago which contains environmental and natural resources of such statewide importance the florida legislature declared it to be an area of critical state concern under fla stat ch 380  and 2 as a result of its inclusion within the florida keys area of critical state concern the city is statutorily obligated to limit the adverse impacts of development on the quality of its nearshore waters and to protect and improve water quality by providing for the construction operation maintenance and replacement of stormwater management facilities  and 3 the federal and state government ordered the city to comply with national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes requirements or face financial penalties the suspension of federal and state grant funding and a possible building moratoria  and 4 stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into the citys nearshore waters thereby degrading water quality  and 5 the increase in nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of the citys nearshore waters thereby adversely affecting flora and fauna  and 6 improperly channeling water increases the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation  and 7 the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion  and 8 siltation of the citys nearshore waters resulting from increased erosion interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna  and 9 impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge  and 10 improperly managed stormwater runoff from developed and undeveloped property may increase the incidents of flooding and the level of floods which occur thereby endangering property and human life  and 11 improperly managed stormwater runoff from developed and undeveloped property may interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas thereby disrupting biological productivity  and 12 substantial economic losses will result from such adverse impacts upon the citys nearshore waters ecosystem  and 13 sound stormwater management practices result in the avoidance of future problems concerning the development of land and the maintenance of the quality of the citys nearshore waters  and 14 the city maintains a system of stormwater management facilities including but not limited to conduits manholes channels ditches drainage easements retention and detention basins swales infiltration facilities and other components that need regular maintenance and improvements  and 15 all real property in the city benefits from this stormwater system b this article is intended to comply with federal and state law and regulations regarding water quality and has the following objectives 1 to establish a stormwater utility and management program within the city responsible for the construction operation and maintenance of city stormwater devices and facilities  for stormwater system planning  for review of development plans for compliance with stormwater management regulations  and for nearshore water quality management  and 2 to adopt stormwater service assessments sufficient to plan construct operate and maintain stormwater management facilities throughout the city  and 3 to protect restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the citys nearshore waters  and 4 to prevent individuals business organizations companies and governments from causing harm to the community by activities which adversely affect water resources  and 5 to encourage the construction of drainage systems which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems  and 6 to encourage the protection of natural systems and the use of such natural systems in ways which do not impair their beneficial functioning  and 7 to minimize the transport of pollutants to the citys nearshore waters  and 8 to minimize erosion and sedimentation  and 9 to prevent damage to wetlands  and 10 to reduce damage from flooding while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial  and 11 to protect restore and maintain the citys nearshore habitat of flora and fauna  and 12 to ensure the attainment of these objectives by requiring the approval and implementation of a stormwater management program for all activities which have an adverse impact upon the citys nearshore waters  12162014 definitions for the purpose of this article the following definitions shall apply  words used in the singular shall include the plural and

permit and is of the opinion all beneficial use of the landowners property has been denied by applying the ldrs the procedures listed in this section shall be used prior to seeking relief from the courts in order that any denial of beneficial use of property may be remedied nonjudicial forum b the beneficial use determination is a process by which the city evaluates the allegation that no beneficial use remains and can provide relief from the regulations by granting additional development potential providing just compensation or if it so determines extending a purchase offer for the property however this article also intends that such relief not increase the potential for damages to health safety or welfare of future users of the property or neighbors that might reasonably be anticipated if the landowner were permitted to build application written recommendation by department and city attorney a application the nature of this appeal that this chapter denies the landowner all beneficial use of the property requires among other things detailed financial information on the property not typically required or desired in normal applications all applications for beneficial use determinations shall be submitted to the department in accordance with common development application elements of this chapter and shall include at a minimum the following information 1 a description of the specific portions of the ldrs which allegedly eliminate all beneficial use of the property together with all appraisals studies any other supporting evidence and any actions taken by the city related to the property such supporting evidence may include documentation that the property has been listed for sale for at least six 6 months after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives and originals or copies of all bids offers to purchase and other correspondence regarding the sale of such property 2 all factual information and knowledge reasonably

physical features total acreage and present use as well as the use of the property on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter derives 5 a description of the use which the landowner believes represents the propertys minimum beneficial use and all documentation studies and other evidence supporting that position b review by planning department and city attorney not later than 45 working days after receipt of a complete application the department and the city attorney shall review the application for compliance with the deprivation standards of this section and applicable law

before the hearing officer written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the city to the applicant at least 15 working days prior to the scheduled hearing the parties before the hearing officer shall be the city and the applicant testimony and evidence shall be limited to the matters directly relating to the deprivation standards and relief criteria of respectively b not later than 60

writing and shall include all findings of fact and conclusions for warranting the recommendation and if applicable recommendations as to remedy deprivation criteria in determining if a landowner has been deprived of beneficial use of property under this chapter the hearing officer and the council shall take into account the following factors a whether the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the beneficial use application substantially advances a legitimate government interest b whether the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the beneficial use application denies all reasonable economic use of the property c relevant parcel if an applicant owns more than one 1 platted lot a question may exist as to whether more than one 1 of applicants platted lots should be considered as one parcel for the beneficial use determination in determining the relevant parcel the hearing officer should focus on the parcel as a whole and not on particular segments or portions of the parcel the hearing officer shall consider three 3 factors to determine whether individual platted lots should be combined and considered as one parcel for the purpose of the beneficial use determination 1 the physical continuity of the lots or parcels  2 the unity of ownership of the lots or parcels ie does the applicant own all of the lots or parcels in question  and 3 the unity of use between the lots or parcels ie platted urban lots should generally be considered as separate uses but can be combined for purposes of a beneficial use determination if the lots are part of a larger parcel for platted lots this determination should be based on an analysis of the following factors established by the florida supreme court which must be applied to the particular facts and circumstances on a casebycase basis a was it the intent of the landowner to use the lot as a single use b what is the adaptability of the property to be used as a single or separate use versus a combined use c whether the lots are dependent on each other for the ability to have a single use d whether unity of the lots is the highest best use of the parcel e what is the current zoning of each tract f what is the physical size and appearance of the land and what uses exist on surrounding land for example what types of structures presently exist on the lots and surrounding parcels g what is the actual use of the land  and h what is the possibility of the lots being combined in use in the reasonably near future d once the relevant parcel is determined the hearing officer must analyze 1 the economic impact of the regulation on the applicant  and 2 the extent to which the regulation has interfered with the applicants investmentbacked expectations including any relevant factors such as a the history of the property ie when was it purchased how much land was purchased where was the land located what was the nature of title what was the composition of the land and how was it initially used  b the history of the development of the property ie what was built on the property and by whom how was it subdivided and to whom and at what price was it sold what plats were filed what infrastructure is in place  c the history of zoning and regulation ie how and when was the land classified how was the use proscribed what changes in classifications occurred  d how development changed when title was passed e what is the present nature and extent of the property f what were the reasonable expectations of the landowner under state common law g what were the reasonable expectations of the neighboring landowners under state common law h what was the diminution in the investmentbacked expectations of the landowner if any after passage of the regulation  and i what was the appraised fair market value immediately before and immediately after the effective date of the regulation granting relief a recommendation if the finding made under this subdivision is that a landowner has been denied all reasonable economic use of the property and only if all reasonable economic use of the property has

unexpired official act as enumerated below in ad of the city approving the proposed development that occurred prior to the effective date of the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of filing of the vested rights application ie  to be a valid act the act must have been in compliance with the land development regulations that existed at the time of approval and the approval must have been issued by an official or commission properly delegated with the authority to issue the approval any one of the following may constitute an official act of the city for purposes of the vested rights determination a a valid unexpired building permit issued prior to the effective date of the comprehensive plan or land development regulations in effect at the time of filing of the vested rights application ie   or b one 1 or more valid unexpired permits or approvals issued by the city except that mere approval of a land use designation map amendment zoning designation or rezoning is insufficient to establish vested rights without additional permits or approvals for a specific development project ie mere zoning cannot be considered an official act that can form the basis of a vested rights determination  or c a subdivision plat recorded in the official records of the city which fulfills the criteria set forth in fla stat  3800518 may be an official act except that individual lots within the subdivision must also demonstrate that this applicant acquired a vested right to build on the individual lot by obtaining additional governmental approvals

reasonable for example an act of purchasing the property entering into contracts or incurring additional obligations done after the 2005 comprehensive plan was pending or became effective does not constitute reasonable reliance 3 this applicant incurred such substantial obligations and expenditures that it would be highly inequitable or unjust to require that the development conform with the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application to meet this requirement the applicant must demonstrate that a application of the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application would prevent or prohibit the applicant from completing the proposed development for example if the applicant could still complete the proposed development under the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application without undue hardship by making mere modifications to the development plan the applicant cannot demonstrate a vested right and must make the modifications required by the comprehensive plan and land development regulations in effect at the time of the filing of the vested rights application  and b substantial changes of position or expenditures incurred prior to the official act upon which the vested rights claim is based are undertaken at the applicants own risk and will not be considered in making a vested rights determination 4 development of this project has

ground cover or mulch as they increase the need for herbicide use have no habitat value reflect rather than absorb heat do not produce oxygen like plants and the runoff from crushed gravel results in high turbidity in near shore waters resulting in layers of silt which can kill off sea grass corals and marine life in no case may the use of these materials exceed 30 percent of the total pervious site area e the landscape construction documents shall include but not be limited to the following i location of all underground and above ground utilities and boxes including overhead utilities  ii

design values 8 yard waste management composting and use of mulches a yard waste management yard wastes shall not be disposed of or stored by shorelines in ditches or swales or near storm drains  rationaleyard wastes release nutrients as they decompose which may pollute the receiving water improper disposal of yard wastes can also contribute to flooding by causing stormwater runoff to backup in drainage systems in addition improper disposal may lead to spreading of invasive plants to new areas b composting shredded yard clippings and leaves should be used for mulch or be composted for use as fertilizer diseased organic material should not be stored composted or used as mulch and should be properly disposed of to avoid spreading disease c use of mulches i composting of organic yard wastes provide many benefits and their use is strongly encouraged the resulting materials are excellent soil amendments and conditioners other recycled organic solid waste products are also available and should be used when appropriate ii grass clippings are a benefit to lawns by replacing nutrients drawn from the soil and as mulch that helps retain moisture lessening the need to irrigate grass clippings should be left on the lawn mulching mowers are recommended because the grass clippings are chopped very finely by special blade and shroud configurations iii if a conventional mower equipped with a side discharge chute is used the following practices should be employed when mowing near the shoreline direct the chute away from the waterbody when mowing upland areas direct the chute back onto the yard not onto the road or driveway iv other mulches except grass clippings can be applied and maintained at appropriate depths in planting beds to assist soils in retaining moisture reducing
