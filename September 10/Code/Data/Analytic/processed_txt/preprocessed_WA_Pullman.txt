some parcel owners have been required or will be required to obtain coverage under a separate npdes stormwater permit which authorizes stormwater discharges associated with certain industrial or municipal activities the city council further recognizes that such permit holders are required to develop extensive stormwater management programs which when properly implemented can reduce the discharge of pollutants into the public stormwater and surface water system and aid the city in controlling the overall effects of stormwater pollution parcels or portions of parcels that meet one of the criteria listed below to the finance directors satisfaction shall receive a reduction of 20% from the annual fee charged under pcc  as currently enacted or hereafter amended for that portion of the parcels covered under an applicable npdes stormwater permit a any parcel that has an active and valid npdes industrial stormwater permit a copy of the permit and the stormwater pollution

the city transportation system continues to be an integral component of the city stormwater control facility b fees shall be waived for municipal parks public trails and bike paths so long as their owners cooperate with the utility in the provisions of educational services and water quality control efforts parks trails and bike paths have minimal intensity of impervious development and provide opportunities for natural resource education and development of an appreciation for water quality c fees shall be waived for all undeveloped parcels the city council finds that such parcels generally have no improvements built on them generate little to no traffic generate less runoff and generally are in a natural state thereby imposing no burden upon the system and receiving no benefit from the utilitys services and facilities information that a property categorized as undeveloped is being used otherwise may result in a loss of this waiver   property owners to pay fees the owner of each nonwaived parcel within the boundaries of the city as they now exist or as they may be hereafter amended shall pay the stormwater users fee and charges as provided in this chapter property owners seeking credits or waivers shall pay the full fee until such time that the credit or waiver is granted by the finance director after which reduced fees will be applied   billing procedures and

wetlands shall be rated according to the department of ecology wetland rating system found in the washington state wetland rating system for eastern washington department of ecology publication #1406030 or as amended and approved by the department of ecology this document contains definitions and methods for determining if the general criteria below are met a wetland rating categories i category i wetlands are 1 alkali wetlands  2 wetlands with high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the washington natural heritage programdepartment of natural resources  3 bogs and calcareous fens  4 mature and oldgrowth forested wetlands over onequarter acre with slowgrowing trees  5 forests with stands of aspen  and 6 wetlands that perform many functions very well scores

ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime  or 4 provide a high level of function ii category ii wetlands are 1 forested wetlands in the floodplains of rivers  2 mature and oldgrowth forested wetlands over onequarter acre with fastgrowing trees  3 vernal pools  and 4 wetlands that perform functions well scores between 1921 points these wetlands are difficult though not impossible to replace and provide high levels of some functions these wetlands occur more commonly than category i wetlands but still need a relatively high level of protection iiicategory iii wetlands are wetlands with a moderate level of functions scores between 1618 points wetlands scoring between 1618 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than category ii wetlands iv category iv wetlands have the lowest level of functions scores fewer than 16 points and are often heavily disturbed these are wetlands should be able to be replaced and in some cases be able to be improved however experience has shown that replacement cannot be guaranteed in any specific case these wetlands may provide some important functions and also need to be protected b date of wetland rating wetland rating categories shall be applied as the wetland exists on the date of adoption of the

criteria i a larger buffer is needed to protect other critical areas  ii the buffer or adjacent uplands has an overall slope steeper than 15 percent or is susceptible to erosion and standard erosion control measures will not prevent adverse impacts to the wetland  or iii the buffer area has minimal vegetative cover although implementation of a buffer planting plan may substitute for increasing the buffer width in no case shall wetland buffers be increased to a width greater than two times that of the standard required buffer d reduced wetland buffer width the planning director may allow the standard wetland buffer width to be reduced in accordance with the critical area report and the most current accurate and complete scientific and technical information available on a casebycase basis when it is determined that a smaller area is adequate to protect the wetland functions and values based on sitespecific characteristics this determination shall be supported by documentation showing that a reduced buffer is adequate based on all of the following criteria i requiring the standard buffer poses an extraordinary hardship on the landowner  ii the existing buffer area is wellvegetated with native species and has an overall slope of less than ten percent  and iiino direct or indirect shortterm or longterm adverse impacts to wetlands will result from the proposed activity in no case

act of 197 revised washington rcw washington administrative wac as amended   purpose and intent washingtons shoreline management act rcw 9058 was passed by the state legislature in 1971 and adopted by the public in a referendum the sma was created in response to a growing concern among residents of the state that serious and permanent damage was being done to shorelines by unplanned and uncoordinated development the goal of the sma was to prevent the inherent harm in an uncoordinated and piecemeal development of the states shorelines while protecting shoreline resources by regulating development the sma is also intended to provide for appropriate shoreline use by encouraging land uses that enhance and conserve shoreline functions and values the sma has three broad policies 1 encourage waterdependent and wateroriented uses uses shall be preferred which are consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment or are unique to or dependent upon use of the states shorelines 2 promote public access the publics opportunity to enjoy the physical and aesthetic qualities of natural shorelines of the state shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible consistent with the overall best interest of the state and the people generally 3 protect shoreline natural resources including the land and its vegetation and wildlife and the waters of the state and their aquatic life the intent of the city of pullman shoreline master program is to ensure comprehensive planning for the citys shorelines and to ensure the adoption and implementation of use regulations together with maps diagrams charts or other descriptive material and text a statement of desired goals and standards developed in accordance with the policies adopted by the state   purpose and relationship to state planning and shoreline laws washington states citizens voted to approve the shoreline management act sma of 1971 in november 1972 in accordance with the sma whitman county and incorporated cities and towns developed and adopted their first shoreline master program smp in 1974 the sma and implementing smp guidelines require all towns cities and counties across the state to comprehensively update their smps the smp update allows preparations of a locally tailored program that represents the visions and interests of our citizens and meets the needs of our rural communities the goals policies and regulations of this program are intended to be consistent with the state shoreline guidelines in wac 17326 after the citys local development and
