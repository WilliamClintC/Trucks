monroe county conservation district guidance stormwater management and west nile virus source brodhead mcmichaels creeks watershed act 167 stormwater management draft  the monroe county conservation district recognizes the need to address the problem of nonpoint source pollution impacts caused by runoff from impervious surfaces the new stormwater policy being integrated into act 167 stormwater management regulations by the pa department of environmental protection padep will make nonpoint pollution controls an important component of all future plans and updates to existing plans in addition to meet postconstruction antidegradation standards under the state national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permitting program applicants will be required to employ best management practices bmps to address nonpoint pollution concerns studies conducted throughout the united states have shown that wet basins and in particular constructed wetlands are effective in traditional stormwater management areas such as channel stability and flood control and are one of the most effective ways to remove stormwater pollutants united states environmental protection agency 199 center for watershed protection 2000 from maryland to oregon studies have shown that as urbanization and impervious surfaces increase in a watershed the streams in those watersheds become degraded cwp 2000 although there is debate over the threshold of impervious cover when degradation becomes apparent some studies show as little as 6% while others show closer to 20% there is agreement that impervious surfaces cause nonpoint pollution in urban and urbanizing watersheds and that degradation is ensured if stormwater bmps are not implemented although constructed wetlands and ponds are desirable from a water quality perspective there may be concerns about the possibility of these stormwater management structures becoming breeding grounds for mosquitoes the conservation district feels that although it may be a valid concern municipalities should not adopt ordinance provisions prohibiting wet basins for stormwater management mosquitoes the questions surrounding mosquito production in wetlands and ponds have intensified in recent years by the outbreak of the mosquitoborne west nile virus as is the case with all vectorborne maladies the life cycle of west nile virus is complicated traveling from mosquito to bird back to mosquito and then to other animals including humans culex pipiens was identified as the vector species in the first documented cases from new york in 1999 this species is still considered the primary transmitter of the disease across its range today there are some 60 species of mosquitoes that inhabit pennsylvania along with c pipiens three other species have been identified as vectors of west nile virus while four more have been identified as potential vectors the four known vectors in ne pennsylvania are culex pipiens c restuans c salinarius and ochlerotatus japonicus all four of these species prefer and almost exclusively use artificial containers old tires rain gutters birdbaths etc as larval habitats in the case of c pipiens the most notorious of the vector mosquitoes the dirtier the water the better they like it the important factor is that these species do not thrive in functioning wetlands where competition for resources and predation by larger aquatic and terrestrial organisms is high the remaining four species aedes vexans ochlerotatus canadensis o triseriatus and o trivittatus are currently considered potential vectors due to laboratory tests except the o trivittatus which did have one confirmed vector pool for west nile virus in pa during 2002 all four of these species prefer vernal habitats and ponded woodland areas following heavy summer rains these species may be the greatest threat of disease transmission around stormwater basins that pond water for more than four days this can be mitigated however by establishing ecologically functioning wetlands stormwater facilities if a stormwater wetland or pond is constructed properly and a diverse ecological community develops mosquitoes should not become a problem wet basins and wetlands constructed as stormwater management facilities should be designed to attract a diverse wildlife community if a wetland is planned proper hydrologic soil conditions and the establishment of hydrophytic vegetation will promote the population of the wetland by amphibians and other mosquito predators in natural wetlands predatory insects and amphibians are effective at keeping mosquito populations in check during the larval stage of development while birds and bats prey on adult mosquitoes the design of a stormwater wetland must include the selection of hydrophytic plant species for their pollutant uptake capabilities and for not contributing to the potential for vector mosquito breeding in particular species of emergent vegetation with little submerged growth are preferable by limiting the vegetation growing below the water surface larvae lose protective cover and there is less chance of anaerobic conditions occurring in the water stormwater ponds can be designed for multiple purposes when incorporated into an open space design a pond can serve as a stormwater management facility and a community amenity aeration fountains and stocked fish should be added to keep larval mosquito populations in check publications from the pa department of health and the penn state cooperative extension concerning west nile virus identify aggressive public education about the risks posed by standing water in artificial containers tires trash cans rain gutters bird baths as the most effective method to control vector mosquitoes conclusion the conservation district understands the pressure faced by municipalities when dealing with multifaceted issues such as stormwater management and encourages the incorporation of water quality management techniques into stormwater designs as monroe county continues to grow conservation design infiltration and constructed wetlands and ponds should be among the preferred design options to reduce the impacts of increases in impervious surfaces when designed and constructed appropriately the runoff mitigation benefits to the community from these design options will far outweigh their potential to become breeding grounds for mosquitoes east marlborough township stormwater management ordinance appendix 5 soil use guide stormwater mgmt & land disturb soil use guide soil type det e n t i on bas in

process that strives to minimize disturbances to land site hydrology and natural resources and maintain the natural hydrologic regime drainage patterns and flow conditions of a site to the maximum extent practicable this appendix is intended to build on that process by providing additional information for achieving site designs that best maintain preconstruction stormwater runoff conditions protect site amenities and preserve natural resources this appendix describes the following components of the natural hydrology site design process  design principles and techniques   design process   design practices  and  references some common drainage design approaches for land development radically alter natural hydrologic conditions by constructing collection and conveyance systems that are designed to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach has often led to the degradation of water quality reduced groundwater recharge and increased volumes of runoff as well as the expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing increased volumes of concentrated runoff at some downstream location the natural hydrology site design process encourages land development site designs that minimize postdevelopment runoff rates and volumes and that minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities this process strives to incorporate the desired land development into the natural hydrologic landscape in a manner that maintains and utilizes existing site hydrology features and functions to minimize generation of new stormwater this avoids cumulative environmental impacts often associated with land development and reducing the need for and size of constructed stormwater facilities this approach minimizes the disturbance of land area natural features and site hydrology  preserves significant concentrations of open space woodlands and corridors of environmentally sensitive features  and incorporates landscapebased bmps and low impact development techniques to minimize the utilization of more intrusive structural stormwater facilities with this design process the primary goals of a land development project can be achieved while minimizing the negative environmental impacts and avoiding management costs associated with unnecessary stormwater runoff the fundamental principle of this design process is that site hydrology features are considered up front in the land development design process and are prioritized as integral aspects to be maintained and utilized within the site design rather than being first sacrificed for space needed for traditional site layout or for construction of more intrusive stormwater facilities 2 natural hydrology site design is not a new approach but rather a holistic process that combines certain principles of low impact development conservation design and sustainable design and focuses on reducing unnecessary alterations to the natural patterns and functions of existing onsite hydrologic features these natural hydrologic features tend to perform their hydrologic function ie infiltration evapotranspiration flow attenuation pollutant removal etc very efficiently and sometimes have the hydrologic capacity to perform that function on increased runoff loadings from the built environment however care must be taken to adequately characterize the capacity of their hydrologic function and avoid overwhelming the feature with excessive runoff loadings thus causing unintended impairments that are completely counterproductive to the purpose of natural hydrology site design preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful site design considerations natural hydrology site design should serve as the foundation of the overall site design approach and when applied in conjunction with the design professionals overall land development goals and desired outcomes can help shape the overall vision and conceptual layout of the land development project site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage applying this site design process helps maintain site hydrology and manage stormwater by minimizing the generation of stormwater runoff achieved by designing to the land considering site drainage patterns and infiltration characteristics reducing grading and compaction and considering scale and placement of buildings  managing stormwater as close to the point of generation as possible by disconnecting impervious surfaces and distributing storm flows to landscapedbased bmps  providing open and vegetated channel conveyance as needed to treat water quality reduce velocity and infiltrate  and managing remaining conveyed stormwater in common open space as needed to disperse low velocity storm flows treat water quality infiltrate and release a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features design principles and techniques natural hydrology site design involves identifying and prioritizing natural resources and natural and manmade hydrologic features and incorporating such features into the overall site design to take advantage of their efficiencies of hydrologic performance their cost efficiencies of reducing the need for or size of constructed stormwater facilities and their aesthetic amenities the five design principles to be achieved by this approach are as follows  minimize land disturbance  both surface and subsurface  minimize the cumulative area to be covered by impervious and compacted surfaces  designing to the land so that the layout of constructed and landscape features utilizes the natural topography and minimizes grading  design the constructed stormwater management system to take advantage of the natural hydrologic landscape to achieve the required stormwater runoff control standards  refine the site design and layout to optimize the cumulative benefits of the natural 3 hydrologic features the constructed stormwater management system and the land development components to achieve the minimum postconstruction runoff volume peak discharge rates and pollutant loads from the proposed land development site techniques to be applied to achieve the design principles are presented in table b1 design process the first step in applying natural hydrology site design is to identify delineate and assess the functions of all existing natural resources and natural and manmade hydrologic features that are located within the project site  will receive discharge from the project site  or may be impacted by runoff or disturbance from the proposed land development project this includes  streams waterways springs wetlands vernal pools and water bodies   drainage patterns conveyances and discharge points   natural infiltration areas and patterns   areas of natural vegetation that provide significant evapotranspiration pollutant removal bank stabilization flow attenuation or riparian buffer functions   floodplains  and  other features that contribute to the overall hydrologic function and value of the site and its receiving streams once this inventory and assessment are completed these identified resources and features are then prioritized for their ability to provide hydrologic function and performance for managing runoff from the proposed site improvements specifically they should be prioritized as follows  those to be incorporated into the site design in a manner that provides for their protection from any disturbance or impact from the proposed land development   those to be protected from further disturbance or impact and for which the proposed land development will provide improvement to existing conditions   those that can be incorporated into and utilized as components of the overall site design in a manner that protects or improves their existing conditions while utilizing their hydrologic function eg for infiltration evapotranspiration or reducing pollutant loads runoff volume or peak discharge rates etc to reduce the need for or size of constructed bmps  and  those that may be considered for alteration disturbance or removal these prioritizations are then applied as the basis on which to begin the site design layout grading construction and permanent ground cover designs to achieve the five 5 design principles outlined above the following section describes just a few of the many design practices methods and techniques that are available to achieve the landowners desired land development goals and the desired environmental efficiencies intended by natural hydrology site design 4 table b1  site design process principles and techniques design principles design techniques minimize land disturbance  both surface and subsurface  maintain the natural soil structure and vegetative cover that are often critical components of maintaining the hydrologic functions of natural infiltration bioretention flow attenuation evapotranspiration and pollutant removal  protect or improve natural resources to reduce the needs for environmental mitigation future environmental restoration and cumulative flow and water quality impacts of unnecessary disturbances within the watershed system  minimize the disturbance of natural surface and groundwater drainage features and patterns discharge points and flow characteristics natural infiltration and evapotranspiration patterns and characteristics natural stream channel stability and floodplain conveyance etc minimize the cumulative area to be covered by impervious and compacted surfaces  minimize the size of individual impervious surfaces  separate large impervious surfaces into smaller components  disconnect runoff from one impervious surface to another  avoid unnecessary impervious surfaces  utilize porous materials where suited in lieu of impervious materials designing to the land so that the layout of constructed and landscape features utilizes the natural topography and minimizes grading  prioritize onsite hydrologic features ie for protection improvement utilization or alteration and natural site drainage patterns and infiltration characteristics and consider them for the cornerstones of the conceptual site design  reduce grading and compaction by applying selective grading design methods to provide final grading patterns tthat preserve existing topography where it most benefits natural hydrologic functions and where needed  this results in graded areas that evenly distribute runoff and minimize concentrated runoff flows  consider the scale and placement of buildings and other infrastructure to minimize impact to natural hydrologic features  incorporate unique natural scenic and historic site features into the configuration of the development and ensure flexibility in development design to meet community needs for complimentary and aesthetically pleasing development such as can be achieved design and sustainable design approaches 5 design principles design techniques design the constructed stormwater management system to take advantage of the natural hydrologic landscape to achieve the required stormwater runoff control standards  incorporate natural hydrologic features that have been selected for their available capacity and function into the overall system of site runoff controls  incorporate low impact development or similar bmps and distribute storm flows to o reduce runoff  o manage stormwater at or as close to the point of generation as possible  o disconnect discharges from streets and municipal storm sewer systems  and o select and design bmps to give first priority to nonstructural and vegetation landscapebased bmps second priority to surface structural bmps third priority to subsurface structural bmps and design subsurface bmps as shallow as possible  provide open channel conveyance as needed to o treat water quality  o reduce runoff velocity  and o promote infiltratation and evapotranspiration of runoff  manage remaining conveyed stormwater from small storms in common open space areas to achieve multiple objectives o disperse storm flows and reduce velocity  o treat water quality  and o promote infiltrate and evapotranspiration of runoff  provide for appropriate conveyance to retention or detention storage facilities as needed for flows from large storm events  maintain open space functions consistent with common area uses passive recreation onsite sewage management scenic vistas etc refine the site design and layout to optimize the cumulative benefits of the natural hydrologic features the constructed stormwater management system and the land development components to achieve the minimum postconstruction runoff volume peak discharge rates and pollutant loads from the proposed land development site apply site design techniques and practices as appropriate based on  conservation design principles and practices  sustainable design principles and practices  low impact development design principles and practices 6 design practices numerous practices and strategies can be considered where their aim is to sustain and utilize the benefits of existing site hydrology and minimize the generation of new stormwater runoff following are brief descriptions of various practices that can be used to achieve the principles of the natural hydrology site design process site layout practices the following site layout practices are but a few of the methods by which the natural hydrology site design process described above can be implemented such practices are less functions of regimented codes and procedures than about understanding and recognizing the benefits and values that existing resources can contribute to the desired outcomes of the land development project in some circumstances communication among design engineers land planning and environmental professionals knowledgeable developers community representatives and regulatory authorities is also beneficial to combine their collective understanding and perspectives to create effective planning efforts preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants unfortunately some common land development practices encourage just the opposite pattern  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with an impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration designing developments to fit site topography retains much of the natural drainage function in addition designing with the land minimizes the amount of site grading reduces the amount of compaction that can alter site infiltration characteristics and can result in cost savings to the developer protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in fields during the wet season or after large runoff events some development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby eliminating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site to assist in reducing runoff volumes and reducing runoff rates designing around the depression or incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities treats this area as a site amenity rather than a detriment avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff in many instances municipalities have the ability to reduce impervious cover by providing incentives or opportunities in their zoning and subdivision land development ordinances to reduce road width reduce or modify culdesac dimensions reduce or modify curbing requirements and reduce or modify sidewalk requirements 7 disconnecting impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff from these sources and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point within the project site routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to drivewaytostreettostorm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn uses the lawn as a filter strip reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking andor by reducing roadway widths designers should select the narrowest practical street width for the design conditions speed curvature etc narrower neighborhood streets should be considered and encouraged under select conditions reduced street widths also can lower maintenance needs and costs limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicyclerecreational trails that follow backoflot lines as an alternative to reduced sidewalks where appropriate reducing building setbacks reducing building setbacks from streets reduces the size of impervious areas of driveways and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem constructing compact developments or conservation design low impact cluster or compact development can reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots savings result from reduced street length which also contributes to a reduction in development and longterm maintenance costs reduced site disturbance and preservation of open space help buffer sensitive natural areas and retain more of a sites natural hydrology development can be designed so that areas of high infiltration soils are reserved as stormwater infiltration areas construction activity can be focused onto les sensitive areas without affecting the gross density of development stormwater best management practices stormwater best management practices bmps are intended to supplement natural hydrology site design techniques where needed structural in nature such practices include bioretention facilities rain gardens swales and other engineered stormwater bmps listed here are techniques intended to help manage stormwater predominantly at or near the source rather than traditional techniques that largely release runoff over an extended period of time to adjacent properties and streams this list in no way exhaustive gives examples of a few of the most common practices 8 bioretention this type of bmp combines open space with stormwater treatment soil and plants rather than sand filters treat and store runoff infiltration and evapotranspiration are achieved often coupled with an underdrain to collect water not infiltrated or used in the root zone rain gardens typically rain gardens are shallow depression areas containing a mix of water tolerant native plant species the intent is to capture runoff for storage and use in the root zone of plants intended largely as a way of managing stormwater et rain gardens often function as infiltration facilities as well reducing the need for storm sewers increasing the use of natural or vegetated drainage swales can reduce the need for extending storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and back yards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating local citizens who may expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete among others such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads surfaces for which seal coats may be applied should refrain from using permeable paving materials sources conservation design for stormwater management delaware department of natural resources and environmental control and the brandywine conservancy september 1997 conservation
