activities using temporary and portable structures only exh a 2152012   nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate exh a 2152012   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county of colusa recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency exh a 2152012   variance appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections a are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance d upon consideration of the factors of the purposes of this chapter the city of williams may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter exh a 2152012

existing on the effective date of this udc since it is smaller than the minimum lot size and narrower than the minimum lot width it cannot be subdivided further this lot is conforming because it is lawfully existing on the effective date of this udc even though it is more than twice as large as the minimum lot area for the n616 district it cannot be subdivided unless the new lots are configured to meet the minimum lot width requirement this lot is conforming because it is lawfully existing on the effective date of this udc this lot could be subdivided into two lots provided that each lot

distance from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line at the front setback line see figure 2a measurement of lot width  standard figure 2a measurement of lot width  standard corner lots lot width for regulatory purposes is the distance from the interior side lot line to the side street lot line measured at the front building line minus the difference between the street yard setback and the side yard setback see figure 2b measurement of lot width  corner figure 2b measurement of lot width  corner irregular lots lot width is the distance from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line along the tangent of the curve representing the front building line see figure 2c measurement of lot width  irregular the front building line is the front setback line however if an alternative front building line has been established on the plat of a subdivision that is more distant than the front setback line from the front property line then the lot width is measured at the alternative front building line figure 2c measurement of lot width  irregular setbacks a generally setbacks are measured from lot lines towards the center of the lot as follows 1 front setbacks are measured from the front lot line the front lot line is the lot line that abuts the rightofway from which the lot takes its address 2 rear setbacks are measured from the rear lot line the rear lot line is the lot line that is opposite from the front lot line 3 side setbacks are measured from side lot lines side lot lines are lot lines that intersect with front lot lines b flag lots on flag lots setbacks are measured as provided in subsection a above except that the front setback line is measured from the shared lot line see figure 3 setback measurement figure 3 setback measurement 4 height a buildings building height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average finished grade along the front building line to 1 the highest peak or ridge line of the roof for pitched roof styles  or 2 the top of the parapet for flat roof styles b other structures structure height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average finished grade around the base of the structure to the highest point on the structure this measurement applies to 1 structures without roofs eg fences  and 2 amateur radio antennae whether mounted on a roof the ground or another structure c specialized structures and building appurtenances 1 specialized structures and building appurtenances are not counted in the calculation of building height provided that a they project not more than i

calculations 1 base site area a generally base site area is used to calculate gross density see density b calculation base site area equals the total area of the parcel proposed for development gross site area minus the sum of the areas of the following 1 land within the planned rightofway of existing streets or streets that are on the adopted thoroughfare plan of the city of williams 2 land that is within major utility rightsofway that are wider than fifty feet 3 land that is cut off from development by railroads limited access highways waterbodies or wetlands and is not proposed for development 4 land that has previously been set aside as protected open space eg subject to a conservation easement plat restriction or condition of development approval see figure 1 illustrative calculation of base site area figure 1 illustrative calculation of base site area 2 net buildable area a generally net buildable area is used to identify the area of a parcel where development will occur and that is not in the protected open space b calculation net buildable area is equal to the lesser of 1 base site area calculated as provided in base site area minus areas of open water streams are measured to the ordinary mean high water mark and delineated wetlands that were not already subtracted from the area of the parcel proposed for development to calculate the base site area eg wetlands or open water areas that are within previously dedicated conservation easements or cut off from development by a limited access highway are not subtracted more than once  or 2 the total area of the parcel proposed for development minus the area of open space required for the development type in residential area and density and parcel standards see figure 2 illustrative calculation of net buildable area figure 2 illustrative calculation of net buildable area using a thirty percent open space ratio for illustrative purposes the net buildable area for the illustration on the left is calculated as base site area minus areas of open water and delineated wetlands  and the net buildable area for the righthand illustration on the right is calculated as the total area of the parcel proposed for development minus the area of required open space 3 open space ratio a generally osr refers to open space which is a measure of green space and areas of open water on a parcel proposed for development b calculation of requirement this subsection sets out how to calculate how much commonlyowned open space is required in a residential development 1 the amount of commonlyowned open space that is required in a residential development is calculated as the required osr see table 1 residential area and density standards times the total area of the parcel proposed for development 2 the amount of open space that is required in a nonresidential development is calculated as the required osr see table 2 nonresidential open space and building scale times the total area of the parcel proposed for development 3 the required osr is a minimum requirement an increased osr may result if the sum of the areas required for compliance with bufferyard requirements natural resource protection requirements stormwater management requirements parking lot landscaping requirements recreation requirements and state or federal environmental laws is greater than the open space that would be required by application of the minimum osr c calculation of compliance this subsection sets out how to calculate the osr of a proposed development in order to determine whether it complies with the requirements of this zoning the osr of a parcel proposed for development is calculated by dividing the total amount of commonlyowned open space on the parcel by the total area of the parcel see figures 3a illustrative measurement of residential open space ratio and 3b illustrative measurement of nonresidential open space ratio 2 open spaces that qualify for the calculation of osr include all areas of commonlyowned open space that are larger than three hundred twenty contiguous square feet in area including but not limited to a bufferyards whether required by this not  b areas of protected natural resources  c stormwater management systems except enclosed systems  d passive recreation areas  and e parking lot landscaping 3 open spaces that do not qualify for the calculation of osr include any areas on private buildable lots and any commonlyowned open space that is less than three hundred twenty contiguous square feet figure 3a illustrative measurement of residential open space ratio example 6 acres of common open space divided by 12 acre area of parcel proposed for development equals 50% osr figure 3b illustrative measurement of nonresidential open space ratio example 5 acres of bufferyards parking lot landscaping and drainage facilities divided by 12 acre area of parcel proposed for development equals 417% lsr 4 density density is the number of dwelling units per acre of base site area see base site area an example calculation is provided in figure 4  illustrative density calculations figure 4 illustrative density calculations example 28 homes are planned for an 11acre parcel gross density the parcel proposed for development is 11 acres 25 acres including forest and open water were previously dedicated as a conservation easement and 02 acres within planned rightofway of abutting street there are no areas within major utility corridors or cut off from development therefore the base site area is 11  25  02 or 83 acres 28 homes divided by 83 acres equals a gross density of approximately 338 units per acre 5 lot area lot area is the area within the lot lines see figure 5 illustrative lot area calculation figure 5 illustrative lot area calculation example the example at right is a rectangular lot 80 feet wide times 125 feet deep equals 10000 square feet lot area 6 building coverage a building coverage building coverage is the total of areas taken on a horizontal plane at the main grade level of the principal building and all accessory buildings exclusive of uncovered porches terraces and steps all dimensions are measured between the exterior faces of walls b building coverage ratio building coverage ratio is building coverage divided by lot area see figure 6 building coverage ratio illustration figure 6 building coverage ratio illustration 7
