shall be known as the town of penfield best value contract award law  132 findings and intent a the state legislature and governor amended general municipal law  103 ao8692s617 on  to provide local governments greater flexibility in awarding contracts by authorizing the award of purchase contracts including contracts for service work on the basis of best value the state legislation requires political subdivisions with a population of less than 1000000 to pass a local law authorizing the use of the best value award process from assembly bill memo ao8692 b enactment of this legislation provides additional procurement options to localities in ways that may expedite the procurement process and result in cost savings the best value standard for selecting goods and services vendors including janitorial and security contracts is critical to efforts to use strategic sourcing principles to modernize the supply chain and ensure that taxpayers obtain the highest quality goods and services at the lowest potential cost while also ensuring fairness to all competitors c today the federal government approximately half of the states and many localities have added best value selection processes to their procurement options in recognition of these advantages with the increased complexity of the goods and services that municipalities must obtain in order to serve taxpayers it is critical to consider selection and evaluation criteria that measure factors other than cost in the strictest sense d taxpayers are not well served when a public procurement results in low unit costs at the outset but ultimately engenders cost escalations due to factors such as inferior quality poor reliability and difficulty of maintenance best value procurement links the procurement process directly to the municipalitys performance requirements incorporating selection factors such as useful lifespan quality and options and incentives for more timely performance andor additional services e even if the initial expenditure is higher considering the total value over the life of the procurement may result in a better value and longterm investment of public funds best value procurement also encourages competition and in turn often results in better pricing quality and customer service fostering healthy competition ensures that bidders will continue to strive for excellence in identifying and meeting municipalities needs including such important goals as the  131 general provisions  132   133 definitions as used in this chapter the following terms shall have the meanings indicated best value  the basis for awarding contracts for services to the offerer which optimizes quality cost and efficiency among responsive and responsible offerers such basis shall

enterprises as defined in subdivisions 1715 and 20 of  310 of the executive law to be used in evaluation of offers for awarding of contracts for services  134 requirements participation of small and minority and womenowned businesses and the development of environmentally preferable goods and service delivery methods best value procurement will provide muchneeded flexibility in obtaining important goods and services at favorable prices and will reduce the time to procure such goods and services a where the basis for award is the best value offer the town comptroller shall document in the procurement record and in advance of the initial receipt of offers the determination of the evaluation criteria which whenever possible shall be quantifiable and the process to be used in the determination of best value and the manner in which the evaluation process and selection shall be conducted b the town comptroller shall select a formal competitive procurement process in accordance with general municipal law and town of penfield purchasing policies and document its determination in the procurement record the process shall include but is not limited to a clear statement of need  a description of the required specifications governing performance and related factors  a reasonable process for ensuring a competitive field  a fair and equal opportunity for offerers to submit responsive offers  and a balanced and fair method of award where the basis for the award is best value documentation in the procurement record shall where practicable include a quantification of the application of the criteria to the rating of proposals and the evaluation results or where not practicable such other justification which demonstrates that best value will be achieved c the solicitation shall prescribe the minimum specifications or requirements that must be met in order to be considered responsive and shall describe and disclose the general manner in which the evaluation and selection shall be conducted where appropriate the solicitation shall identify the relative importance andor weight of cost and the overall technical criterion to be considered by the town of

shall be known as the stormwater and erosion control law  1983 findings and purpose a the town of penfield finds that uncontrolled drainage and runoff associated with land development or redevelopment has a significant impact upon the health safety and welfare of the community the impacts include but are not limited to the following 1 stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving water bodies degrading water quality 2 the increase in nutrients in stormwater runoff such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters 3 improper design and construction of drainage facilities can increase the velocity of runoff thereby increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation 4 construction requiring land clearing and the alteration of natural topography tends to increase erosion 5 sedimentation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna 6 impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allows less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow 7 improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur endangering property and human life 8 substantial economic loss can result from these adverse impacts on community waters 9 the obstruction of flows or reconstruction backfilling excavation and refuse disposal 10 the change in the slope roughness or distance of travel to the ground or existing water bodies increases erosion potential or reduces capacity of land to properly convey stormwater b it is the purpose and intent of this article to protect maintain and enhance the shortterm and longterm health safety and general  1982 general provisions  1983   1984 general requirements welfare of the citizens of the town of penfield this article has the following objectives 1 prevent increases in the magnitude and frequency of stormwater runoff in order to prevent an increase in flood flows and the hazard and costs associated with flooding 2 prevent decreases in groundwater recharge and stream base flow so as to maintain aquatic life assimilative capacity and potential water supplies 3 maintain the integrity of stream geometry so as to sustain the hydrologic function 4 control erosion and sedimentation so as to prevent its deposition in streams and other receiving water bodies 5 facilitate the removal of pollutants in stormwater runoff so as to perpetuate the natural biological functions of streams 6 secure multiple community benefits including but not limited to groundwater replenishment open space protection and increased recreational opportunities land use planning 7

findings and purpose a land disturbance activities and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites b during the construction process soil is the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water this eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates maintenance andor repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of waterways in addition clearing andor grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat and to provide a healthy living environment for citizens of the town of penfield improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow regulation of land disturbance activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development c as a result the purpose of this article is to safeguard public health protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the town of penfield it seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives 1 meet the
