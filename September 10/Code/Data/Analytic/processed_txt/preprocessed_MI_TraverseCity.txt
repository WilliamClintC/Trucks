may obtain a franchise to provide video services in the city using a standardized uniform form of franchise agreement established by the michigan public service commission mpsc this form includes the right to use the public rightofway to provide such service but does not contain rightofway management and related provisions b telecommunications providers who obtain such a standardized uniform form of franchise agreement will usually have a city permit issued pursuant to the metro act allowing them to construct and maintain their telecommunications facilities in the public rightofway such metro act permits set forth the terms and conditions for such rightofway usage standard forms for such permits were agreed to in a collaborative process between municipalities and providers that was initiated by the mpsc and such standard forms have since been approved by the legislature and the mpsc c because telecommunications providers typically provide video services over combined video and telecommunications facilities such metro act permits generally provide adequate public rightofway protections for the city and the public when such providers are providing video services d other video service providers in particular new providers or existing cable companies may not have a metro act permit issued by the city e the uniform video services local franchise act and the standardized uniform franchise agreement require video service providers to comply with all valid and enforceable local regulations regarding the use and occupation of the public rightofway in the delivery of

of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or when 1 or more of them are located in near proximity to a residential zone church school daycare center or dedicated park thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects shall not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood these special regulations are itemized in this chapter these controls are for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses within any 1 area or to prevent deterioration or blighting of nearby neighborhoods these controls do not legitimatize activities which are prohibited in other chapters of the citys ordinances b in regulating sexually oriented businesses it is the

require the alteration of existing topography and soil structure the disruption of native vegetation and the expansion of impervious surface area over the development site the cumulative effects of the land altering process extend far beyond the property lines of an individual development site and if development is not undertaken within the context of the broader community it will not only degrade the individual development but also the community of which it is a part it is therefore the intent of this chapter to protect and manage vegetation to 1 aid in the stabilization of the environmental balance purification oxygen regeneration groundwater protection and recharge and the control of stormwater runoff 2 safeguard and enhance private and public property values and encourage continued investment in the community 3 enhance community appearance identify unique natural beauty and promote quality development at a suitable scale 4 provide visual screens between land uses of differing character and use intensities 5 prevent reductions in the citys urban forest 6 provide for the preservation of larger native trees which are valuable amenities to the urban environment that once destroyed can only be replaced after generations  and 7 ensure that the local stock of native trees and vegetation is replaced it is recognized that alternative design concepts exist which if adopted could exceed the results envisioned using these development standards it is intended that the requirements of this chapter be flexible and permit latitude in site design and the use of plant materials when it can be shown that variation from the requirements will provide a development substantially better than that achievable using the minimum standards of this chapter the provisions of

partial sunshade 38 hours  shade 3 or less hours 3 topographical conditions  low damp areas poor drainage common  high areas exposure to winds common  retentiondetention areas areas designed to

tolerance  proximity to parking areas  proximity to building exhaust 5 zone hardiness of plant materials the citys location adjacent to grand traverse bay provides an opportunity to utilize plant species that would not be hardy further inland 6 physical characteristics of plant materials species selection will be limited for some sites eg nut and fruitbearing trees would not be suitable for parking areas over pedestrian walkways and the areas to buildings due to the potential for damage to vehicles and the messy litter individual growth habit of plant materials must be considered to
