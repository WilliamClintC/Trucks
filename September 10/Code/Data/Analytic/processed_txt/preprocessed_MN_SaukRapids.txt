in compliance with all land use regulations at the time the nonconformity was created in order to be eligible for the benefits of being a nonconforming use a there may be no expansion enlargement or intensification of any use or any site element of any nonconforming use except to make it a permitted use normal building maintenance and repair are allowed expansion enlargement or intensification of conforming aspects of a nonconforming development are excepted from this requirement for example if a structure has a nonconforming front setback it may be expanded on the sides that do meet setback requirements as long as the expansion itself meets ordinance requirements b no nonconforming use may be resumed if normal operation of the use has been discontinued or if a nonconforming building has been removed and not replaced for a period of 12 or more months time will be calculated as beginning on the day following the last day in which the use was in normal operation and will run continuously thereafter following the expiration of 12 months only uses that are permitted by this ordinance are allowed to be established c full use of a nonconforming use may not be resumed if the amount of land or floor area dedicated to the use is lessened or if the intensity of the use is in any manner diminished for a period of 12 or more months time will be calculated as beginning on the

development patterns of a conventional or traditional nature  however there are situations where innovative proposals for the use of land may be submitted which do not relate to ordinance controls and would have to be rejected even though feasible and beneficial to the community it is to accommodate such innovative proposals even those that may mix land uses within a development exceed stipulated densities or depart from traditional lot sizes that the planned unit development district is established the technology of land development is constantly changing and creative practical approaches to the use of land should be encouraged the provisions of this intended to do so in a manner which is in the best interests of both the developer and the community it is not the intent of this section of the ordinance to be a means in which to avoid meeting the minimum standards of the underlying zoning district more specifically planned unit development districts may provide for progressive developments which may achieve any number of the following a provide a maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of housing and building types permitting increased density per acre a reduction in lot dimensions building setbacks or area requirements  b allow a more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas  c provide more convenient access to services commercial products and workplaces by providing for mixeduse development  d provide for development which preserves andor utilizes existing natural site features and vegetation  e provide more efficient use of land

select areas within the city especially in the d1 historic downtown business district the city has spent significant public funds to install upgraded standard light poles to decorative light poles with banners and streetscaping such as benches and sidewalk furnishings stone and sculptured elements decorative trash receptacles and ornamental trees and vegetation special assessments on businesses within the d1 historic downtown business district have also significantly contributed to financing of decorative light poles and streetscaping the purpose of the decorative light poles and streetscaping is to preserve and advance a historic main street appearance together with strict building sign utility and landscaping aesthetic requirements in the d1 historic downtown business district the location of small wireless facilities on decorative light poles and streetscaping will disrupt the sought after appearance and nullify the significant investments made by the city and business within the d1 historic downtown business district further decorative light poles are not designed to accommodate small cell wireless facilities and locating small cell wireless facilities on expensive decorative light poles likely voids any warranty small cell wireless facilities are therefore prohibited on decorative light poles and streetscaping within the public right of way

regulation of the use of the property or traffic or parking thereon 7 yard sale signs 8 real estate signs 8 square feet or smaller 9 home occupation signs subdivision 17 dynamic displays a findings studies show that there is a correlation between dynamic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look people have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end additionally drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fadeins and fadeouts finally drivers are generally more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly seen or that contain more than a simple message time and temperature signs appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are short easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use these technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and to minimize proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact residential character local spacing requirements could interfere with the equal opportunity to use such technologies and are not included without those requirements however there is the potential for numerous dynamic displays to exist along any roadway if more than one dynamic display can be seen from a given location on a road the minimum display time becomes critical if the display time is too short a driver could be subjected to a view that appears to have constant movement this impact would obviously be compounded in a corridor with multiple signs if dynamic displays become pervasive and there are no meaningful limitations on each signs ability to change frequently drivers may be subjected to an unsafe degree of distraction and sensory overload therefore a longer display time is appropriate a constant message is typically needed on a sign so that the public can use it to identify and find an intended destination changing messages detract from this wayfinding purpose and could adversely affect driving conduct second lane changes stops or turns which could result in traffic accidents accordingly dynamic displays generally should not be allowed to occupy the entire copy and graphic area of a sign in conclusion the city finds that dynamic displays should be allowed on signs but with significant controls to minimize their proliferation and their potential threats to public safety b regulations dynamic displays on signs are allowed subject to the following conditions 1 dynamic displays are allowed only on monument signs where otherwise allowed in the c1 c2 c3 d1 and i1

improvements is not feasible or advisable he or she may request a variance following the established standards and procedures set forth in city 15 subd 4 and subd 5  city 16 subdivision 1  city 18 subdivision 1  city 19 and city 20 subd 9 lot standards minimum lot size and dimensions shall be those required by zoning regulations subd 10 park land dedication a purpose and intent minnesota statute  provides cities with the authority to require that a reasonable portion of any proposed subdivision be dedicated to the public or preserved for conservation purposes or for public use as parks recreational facilities playgrounds trails wetlands or open space also provides cities with the authority to choose to accept an equivalent amount in cash from the applicant for all or part of the portion of the property required to be dedicated to such public uses or purposes the city has determined that new development increases the demand for and use of park property in the city the city has also determined that the demands on city parks and need for additional park space increases as the density of development increases as a general principle larger lots and lower density provide for greater use of private property and place less demands on the citys parks the citys purpose in this to provide a park land dedication system for new development which provides for a larger dedication where density is higher and open spaces are more sporadic in addition it is the citys intent to provide that the amount of park land required to be dedicated by this roughly proportional to the impact on the demand for park use in the city as a result of the new development for residential development where the impact is based more upon the number of people in the new development rather than set a standard percentage of the total development to be dedicated the city intends on providing a system generally based upon the number of lots and potential units in a development  however the city desires to retain the ability to make individualized determinations to ensure that required dedications are related in both nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development on the demand for such property in the city for commercial and industrial developments since the impact is primarily based upon the loss of open and green space and the loss of natural areas the city will use a standard percentage as its starting point in establishing a dedication  however as with residential developments the city will review each individual project to ensure that the proposed dedication is roughly proportional to the impacts of that development b dedication required in every plat replat or subdivision including minor subdivisions of land allowing for development for residential purposes and in every rezoning a reasonable portion of the property shall be dedicated to the public or preserved for conservation purposes or for public use as parks recreational facilities playgrounds trails wetlands or open space as determined by resolution of the city council the city council will initially examine each plat replat subdivision or rezoning in terms of the following formula which will then be adjusted if the unique characteristics and uses of the land dictate such adjustment 1350 square feet per single family residential lot 700 square feet per unit possible for multiple family developments 5% of land area for commercial and industrial lots not including streets or other public dedications c individual analysis of development the above formula will serve as the starting point for the planning commission advisory park board and the city council in determining the amount of property required to be dedicated by each individual applicant the city council will if requested by the applicant or may upon a recommendation of either the advisory park board or planning commission complete an analysis of the dedication requirements as they pertain to an individual development and the city may increase or decrease the amount of the property required to be dedicated or set aside based upon such analysis any reasonable expenses incurred by the city whether as a result of the request of the applicant or the citys own initiative in studying the proposed developments impact on the citys parks and open space will be passed an expense of the development to the applicant the expenses to be passed the applicant will only be those associated with the affects of the applicants proposed project and not costs arising from the study of other development within the city d council decision as to dedication type the city council will after reviewing the recommendation of the planning commission and advisory park board decide the form of the dedication the location and the type of use whether for conservation purposes or for public use as parks recreation facilities playgrounds trails wetlands or open space the land to be dedicated or set aside shall be suitable for public uses as parks playgrounds or such other purposes as determined by the city council and the city will not be required to accept property which is not usable for such purposes as determined by the city or which would require significant expenditures to make them usable for such purposes the city council may take into consideration size shape topography hydrology geology tree cover access and location among other factors when determining whether property is acceptable for dedication it is the intent of the city that park land or set aside land not be selected based solely on its nonusability to the applicant because of wetland classification or other impediments to development e cash in lieu of property a the city council may after reviewing the recommendation of the planning commission and advisory park board require that the applicant provide for a cash payment in lieu of property dedication the city council in making this decision may take the following factors into consideration 1 whether the land to be dedicated is of sufficient size to provide adequate park facilities  2 whether the land to be dedicated is needed in the immediate location  3 whether preexisting facilities would be better served with additional improvements  4 whether the cash payment would be more beneficial to the overall park system which will be impacted by development  5 maintenance considerations  6 suitability of the land for the intended use  andor 7 the location of the property b the city council may decide to accept all or a portion of the property required to be dedicated if the city decides to accept only a portion of the property required to be dedicated the applicant will be required to make a cash payment in lieu of dedication for the amount of land not accepted for dedication by the city f credit for private open space where a private open space for park or recreation purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision the city council will give consideration to allowing partial credit for such space toward the dedication required by this of the following minimum factors will be required to be satisfied before such credit will be considered 1 the land area must be available for the use without preference of all of the residents of the proposed subdivision  2 the required setbacks must not be included in the computation of such land area  3 the use of the private open space must be restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants or declarations which run with the land in favor of the owners of the property within the subdivision and cannot be eliminated without the prior approval of the city council after review and recommendation by the park board  4 the proposed private open space must be of sufficient size shape location and topography for park and recreational purposes or must contain unique natural features that are important to be preserved  and c if the city elects to receive a cash payment in lieu of property dedication the applicant must pay the city the amount as determined by resolution of the city the amount will be based upon the fair market value of the property which would otherwise be required to be dedicated or set aside the fair market value of the land is defined as that amount which a willing buyer would pay and a willing seller would accept for the property as of the date of the final approval of the plat a determination of the fair market value of the property shall be initially made by the city assessor who shall make a recommendation to the city council for final determination the city council will by resolution set annual base values for vacant property in the city from which the city would make adjustments for individual developments depending on the unique characteristics of the property d cash payments made to the city in lieu of dedication or set aside shall be placed in a special fund and used throughout the city only for the purposes for which the money was obtained g replatted and later development at a higher density where formerly platted property is either replatted or developed at a higher density than was anticipated by the city at the time of the original platting the developer will provide the additional dedication amount at the time of the replat or site plan approval and the value of the land shall be determined as of the final approval of the replat or site plan less the value of improvements such developer shall receive a credit in the amount of the preexisting dedication or cash received by the city for such property h in addition to other dedication requirements the dedications required by this in addition to and not in lieu of dedications required for public use as streets roads sewers electric gas and water facilities storm water drainage and holding areas or ponds and similar utilities and improvements 5 the proposed open space must reduce the demand for public recreational facilities to serve the development i payment if cash in lieu of dedication is called for by the city the applicant may either pay such amount upon final approval of the plat or subdivision or may sign an agreement and waiver providing for such amount to become part of the total assessments levied against the property platted or subdivided and be paid in accord with the terms of such assessment as determined by resolution of the city council and in accord with minnesota statutes j dedication not used in calculating density land dedicated or set aside for public use or private land accepted by the city as an alternative to public dedication or set aside will not be used in calculating density for requirements of the citys zoning  storm drainage area dedication required a in every plat replat or subdivision of land whether for residential commercial or industrial purposes a reasonable portion of the property platted or subdivided shall be dedicated to the public or preserved for public use for storm water drainage improvements storm water holding areas and ponds and other similar improvements the portion and location of the property to be so dedicated or preserved for public use shall be determined by the city council prior to the final approval of any plat replat or subdivision of land developers shall not be compensated for land so dedicated or preserved for such public use where the dedication is roughly proportional to the impacts created by said development b if the city requires a developer to dedicate or preserve for such public use more property than is roughly proportional to the impacts created by the development the city will compensate the developer for said additional property the amount of compensation shall be based upon the fair market value of the property which is defined as that which a willing buyer would pay and a willing seller would accept for the property as of the date of the application for subdivision a determination of the fair market value shall be made by the city assessor in the same manner as the assessor determines the fair market value of the land for tax purposes c this storm drainage area dedication applies to all subdivisions and plats which have not obtained preliminary plat approval as
