21  2112113 21262131 21412145 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  adopted dec 15 2008 cross reference buildings and building regulations ch 8  environment ch 18 streets sidewalks and other public places ch 36  utilities ch 40 article i  in general statutory authorization the legislature of the state of south carolina has in sc laws title 5 and title 6 and amendments thereto delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of mauldin south carolina does ordain as follows below art i  a 7212014 findings of fact the special flood hazard areas of the city of mauldin are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages art i  b 7212014 statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the ordinance prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of the ordinance are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs art i  c 7212014 lands to which this

disturbing activities is a major source of sediment sediment suspended in streams lakes and other waters of this county constitutes a major pollution problem and contributes to flooding conditions as the sediment settles out it fills stream channels lakes and reservoirs b erosion and sedimentation can be effectively controlled but cannot be completely eliminated either during active construction or after stabilization from both a technical and an economic standpoint c natural erosion during stormwater runoff has always occurred and will continue at low rates from wellstabilized areas it will

submit a copy of faa form 74601 to the affected airport for review said airport shall have ten 10 business days to make any comments 10 airport zones relating to noise restrictions as noted in subsection 2 one 1 of the intentions of ap protective areas regulations is to encourage development which is compatible with airport use characteristics noise resulting from aircraft operations is the airport use characteristic which most affects surrounding development relating the zoning format to noise criteria is difficult because two 2 land uses which might otherwise be compatible in a specific zoning category may each be affected differently by airport noise for example general commercial zoning may be compatible with airport noise however theaters a commercial use would need special protection at least to the extent that they were notified of potential incompatible noise characteristics on a proposed site prior to their construction supplementary regulations contained in the ap protective areas section of the facilitate notification of potential incompatible uses as a result of aircraft noise without undue restriction of the establishment of retail uses lists the criteria for evaluating and regulating development around the airport sensitive areas surrounding greenville downtown airport and donaldson center are divided into zones i zone i being the most restrictive the official zoning map of greenville county located at the greenville county planning commission delineates the location and area of each of the zones around the airport greenvillespartanburg international airport is surrounded by an airport environs area which prohibits certain future land uses this area is delineated on the official zoning map of greenville county the land uses allowed within the environs area are stated in the greenvillespartanburg airport environs area zoning which is on file with the greenville county planning commission the city of mauldin and the greenvillespartanburg airport commission 11 airport zoning related to sanitary landfill location various studies and observations have resulted in the conclusion that sanitary landfills attract birds and that birds in the vicinity of airports create potential hazards to aircraft operations see faa order so 52005 aircraft accidents have resulted when aircraft collided with lowflying birds particularly during takeoff and landing in order to prevent such an occurrence in greenville the following regulations shall apply with regard to location of landfills a no landfill shall be located within ten thousand 10000 feet from a runway of any airport b landfills located further than ten thousand 10000 feet but within five 5 miles of a runway of any airport will be reviewed on a case by case basis by the respective airport commission staff who may in turn contact the bird hazard group and the federal aviation administration if in the opinion of the airport commission staff the landfill poses a threat to safe aircraft operations then the landfill shall be considered an incompatible land use 12 enforcement it shall be the duty of the zoning administrator to administer and enforce the regulations prescribed herein applications for permits and variances shall be made to the building standards department upon a form published for that purpose applications required by this be submitted to the zoning administrator shall be promptly considered and granted or denied application for action by the board of appeals shall be forthwith transmitted by the secretary editors note former   ap airport protective areas has been redesignated as   by the discretion of the editor in order to avoid duplication uvd urban village district 1 purpose and findings the urban village district is designed to permit the development of land in a manner consistent with the historic and timeless principles of placemaking an urban village combines commercial civic and residential uses in a compact walkable setting urban villages feature a highly interconnected street network and massing appropriate to create a public realm built on a human scale the intent of this district is to guide the development of urban villages in a manner that accomplishes the following purposes a promote a diverse mix of business commercial office residential institutional educational cultural and entertainment activities for workers visitors and residents b emphasize safe and convenient access to shopping restaurants employment centers entertainment venues and other essential services to pedestrians bicyclists transit riders motorists and people with disabilities c promote the health and wellbeing of residents by encouraging physical activity alternative transportation and greater social interaction d create a sense of place that represents a unique attractive and memorable destination for visitors and residents e enhance the communitys character promotion of highquality urban design f create a feeling of vitality in order to attract private investment invigorate civic pride and enhance the tax base for the city generally an urban village district is intended to be established over a contiguous area of at least ten 10 acres however an urban village district may be established at a smaller site where the context of the site is compatible and appropriate for accomplishing the expressed purposes of the urban village district nothing herein shall prevent a project from being phased in increments of less than ten 10 acres 2 procedures a application the application for a designation of an urban village district shall follow the same procedures as a rezoning application with formal reviews by the planning commission and the city council in addition to the completed rezoning application the applicant shall also submit a conceptual plan for the entire parcel or assemblage of parcels that conveys the approximate layout of streets and alleys civic spaces and buildings nothing in the conceptual plan shall be considered binding on the prospective development  rather the conceptual plan will be used to surmise the applicants intent to adhere to the guidelines of this district generally the city of mauldin finds that the proximity of jobs and shopping activities to housing in an urban village can achieve significant trip reductions produced by the internal capture of homework homeshopping and workshopping trips the city of mauldin further finds and determines that there is compelling public interest to encourage new development to occur in accordance with the criteria set forth in this district accordingly an application to establish an urban village district classification does not necessarily need to be accompanied by a traffic impact analysis andor parking analysis however city staff or the city council may request the submission of a traffic impact analysis andor parking analysis when it has reasonable ground to believe that conditions may exist that would preclude the development from achieving the desired trip reductions noted above applications which consist of property owners of separate tracts of land shall be accompanied by legally binding agreements which establish crossaccess crossparking and similar agreements which affect joint planning of the development b development plans following approval of the urban village district classification the applicant shall be authorized to submit development plans for review and approval and to obtain any applicable permits city staff shall have authority to approve development plans and issue the appropriate permits development plans shall include the technical requirements standards and specifications outlined in the citys preliminary plat and site plan checklists faade elevation checklist and any other materials or information requested by the business and development services director or their appointee where necessary to determine compliance of the proposed development c conformance to zoning and land development regulations generally the appropriate regulations and standards contained in the zoning the land development regulations shall apply to the urban village district where the standards specified for this district conflict with other standards contained in the zoning the land development regulations the standards for this district shall generally prevail in order to accomplish the intent of this district the standards contained in the zoning the land development regulations may be relaxed at the discretion of the business and development services director where necessary to advance the purpose of the urban village district d urban village district standards the design and arrangement of thoroughfares civic spaces and building types is critical to accomplishing the intent described for the urban village district therefore the standards of this district have been organized by 1 thoroughfare design 2 civic space design 3 frontage design and 4 building design applicants should give careful attention to the details in how these various elements interact to form the fabric of a successful urban village project 3 thoroughfare standards a intent good streets form the backbone of healthy communities not only do they perform a dual role as vehicular and pedestrian corridors but they also serve as the communitys primary public spaces the impact of their design on communities cannot be underestimated for communities to be walkable thoroughfares must be designed with pedestrian comfort and safety as critical goals along with the safe and efficient flow of traffic and other considerations such as the accommodation of emergency vehicles parking utilities and storm water to elevate the importance of pedestrian safety and comfort the focus for thoroughfare design should be on design speed rather than the volume of traffic and the level of service in addition thoroughfares should typically be narrower than conventional thoroughfares and arranged in an interconnected gridded network  careful design of intersections should include tighter curb radii b general standards 1 connectivity the most important aspect of any urban village is that it be a walkable place with an interconnected system of streets a wellconnected street network spreads traffic efficiently provides greater opportunities for access by service and emergency vehicles and furthers pedestrian mobility by increasing the number of destinations that can be reached by walking the street network of an urban village development shall be designed to form a grid pattern with streets interlinked at numerous points intersections closely spaced and little to no deadends generally thoroughfares within the development shall terminate at other internal thoroughfares and should also connect wherever possible to those on adjacent sites 2 culsdesac the city of mauldin finds that the use of culsdesac and deadend streets is inconsistent with the public policy of preserving an interconnected street system culsdesac and deadend streets do not promote street connectivity and create inefficiencies in the distribution of traffic and water as well as inefficiencies and increased municipal expenses in the delivery of public services in limited situations culsdesac can be used in areas of topographical constraints andor to avoid disturbing sensitive environmental features the use of culsdesac shall be restricted to appropriate situations  where used culsdesac shall be of the minimum length necessary per the situation loop streets eyebrow configurations and similar alternatives are encouraged in place of culsdesac 3 corner radius clear zone to allow for emergency vehicles eg fire trucks to safely turn corners a twentyfivefoot radius clear zone shall be established free of all vertical obstructions including but not limited to telephone poles sign poles fire hydrants and electrical boxes 4 bike

thoroughfare types the streets within this district are intended to balance the needs of all types of trafficauto bicycle and pedestrianto maximize the mobility and convenience for all the citizens and users while all streets will appropriately balance pedestrian and automobile needs their character will vary by specific location some streets will carry a large volume of both automobile and pedestrian traffic and provide a more intense urban experience while others will provide more intimately scaled streetspace a variety of acceptable thoroughfare types can be calibrated and used in creating a walkable community including alleys lanes roads streets commercialmain streets avenues and boulevards the following thoroughfare types are generally inappropriate in the urban village

communities they provide access to outdoors they act as organizing elements within the structure of communities and downtowns and they serve as public gathering places for all members of the community civic spaces should not be made up of residual space left after buildings are placed on a site ie along sound walls tucked into corners or the like in order for civic spaces to be accessible and usable they should be located within walking distance of residences and workplaces typically one 1 every onefourth 14 to onehalf 12 mile they should be designed and sized appropriately for instance hardscaped plazas work beautifully in the urban village district landscape design should be carefully considered such that landscape materials do not inadvertently obstruct the casual surveillance of a public space and thereby compromise safety b general standards 1 visibility a clear view public space from two 2 to seven 7 feet in height is required and is important for safety and urban design purposes 2 unstructured recreation civic greens squares and plazas should not include active recreation structures such as ball fields and courts 3 slopes at least fifty 50 percent of the civic space shall have slopes less than seven 7 percent exempt stormwater management facilitiesareas which also function as active or passive recreation areas c civic space types the following civic space types are generally acceptable in the urban village district 1 civic green definition an open space available for unstructured recreation while it is often surrounded by buildings a civic green may be

shaped and full landscape compliance would affect adherence to required offstreet parking loading or accessibility requirements 3 additional environmental quality improvements would result from the alternative compliance 4 safety considerations make alternative compliance desirable 5 an alternative compliance proposal meets the intent and purpose of the landscape a manner that is equal to or better than compliance with the regulation contained in code e special consideration special consideration for alternative compliance related to infill change of use or adaptive reuse of an existing site where no exterior improvements are required for occupancy of an existing building and the site in its present state is ninety 90 percent or more impervious 1 transition buffers buffer widths may
