order to achieve compliance with the us environmental protection agencys stormwater regulations a because stormwater discharges from a variety of sources including storm sewers construction waste disposal earth disturbance and resource extraction are major causes of impairment to the water quality of natural coastal and inland water bodies and wetland resource areas this chapter is designed to regulate a myriad of aspects relating to the development or redevelopment of land as well as to detect and eliminate illicit discharges into the citys storm drainage system b this chapter and the regulations promulgated hereunder serve to establish minimum standards design criteria implementation guidance and enforcement to achieve the following objectives establish regulate and enforce stormwater management standards for development and redevelopment projects by adopting and enforcing the nine stormwater management standards set forth in the massachusetts stormwater management policy 1 detect and eliminate illegal discharges to the municipal storm drain system including but not limited to sewage process wastewater wash water indoor drains floor drains sinks from residential

wetlands resource areas resulting from altered drainage patterns 4 establish a stormwater management advisory committee to work with the engineering department in establishing and evaluating rules and regulations to further clarify and implement this chapter 5 regulation of discharges to the municipal storm drainage system and the surface waters and wetlands is necessary for the protection of the city of beverlys water bodies and groundwater and to safeguard the public health safety welfare and the environment increased and contaminated stormwater runoff associated with developed land uses and the accompanying increase in impervious surface is a major cause of impairment of water quality and flow in the ocean lakes ponds streams rivers wetlands and groundwater contamination of drinking water supplies erosion of stream channels alteration or destruction of aquatic and wildlife habitat and flooding a this chapter establishes stormwater management standards for development and redevelopment projects that disturb an acre or more of land to minimize adverse impacts off site and downstream which would be borne by abutters residents andor the general public by complying with all other state and federal statutes and regulations relating to stormwater discharges and adopting the following standards of the massachusetts stormwater policy stormwater management systems must be designed so that postdevelopment peak discharge rates do not exceed predevelopment peak discharge rates a loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized use of infiltration measures to the maximum extent practicable the annual recharge from a site postdevelopment should approximate the annual recharge from the preexisting or existing site conditions based on soil types b for new

eliminate infiltration and inflow into this system no storm drainage discharge is allowed into the municipal sanitary sewer system from any source including but not limited to sump pumps and roof drainage the sewerage system conveys wastewater from residences and commercial and industrial establishments to the south essex sewerage district wastewater treatment plant in salem the citys sewerage system is regulated by sewers of the city the objectives of this section are to minimize the contribution of pollutants to the municipal storm drainage system  1 minimize the negative impact of illicit connections and discharges upon the citys natural resources  2 prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal storm drainage system  and 3 establish legal authority to carry out all inspection surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter 4 d during the construction process soil is highly vulnerable to erosion by wind and water eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species eroded soil also necessitates extraordinary maintenance and

adopted by the city of beverly in july 2007 it requires any residential development of six or more lots or dwelling units to include 12% of its units as affordable housing as defined in the ordinance an affordable housing unit is a dwelling unit that is affordable to and occupied by a low or moderateincome household and meets state requirements for listing on the subsidized housing inventory since inclusionary housing units do not require a comprehensive permit under massachusetts general law their eligibility for the subsidized housing inventory relies on the provisions of 760 cmr 5600 local initiative program lip as an aid to applicants the planning board has referenced portions of the current lip regulations below however the applicant is responsible for understanding confirming and complying with lip requirements as they may be amended from time to time because failure to do so may result in delayed issuance of approvals by the planning board or other city officials with jurisdiction over the project196 a applicants proposing a project that is subject to the inclusionary housing comply by 1 including affordable units in the proposed development or 2 providing

code  3159  the marketrate units until the affordable units are completed inclusion onsite units shall not be the last units to be built in any development  31510 comparable unit requirements inclusion onsite units must be generally comparable to marketrate units in the development comparable will be determined according to the following standards for detached singlefamily dwellings inclusion onsite units must be similar in size  ie they must offer the same number of bedrooms as the average marketrate unit for example if all of the developments singlefamily homes are fourbedroom units the inclusion onsite units must also have four bedrooms because state regulations require overall proportionality of affordable and marketrate units in a single development in certain circumstances the planning board will consider reasonable exceptions to the principle of overall proportionality for example if a development with inclusion units consists of several approval not required anr lots on a street where the surrounding homes are smaller than the proposed new marketrate homes the applicant may request that the inclusion units be designed for comparability in size to established homes in the same neighborhood provided the homes are generally in good condition this request may be made as part of the inclusionary housing site plan application and the planning board may approve the same without requiring the applicant to seek a special permit a as an alternative to designating singlefamily homes as inclusion onsite units the planning board will allow inclusion onsite units to be located in twofamily semidetached or multifamily dwellings of not more than three units pursuant to c2 these dwellings must conform to the design standards specified in  300107 and the following each unit must be separated by a common wall have an atgrade entrance to one unit on the front facade and an atgrade entrance to the other units on a side other than the primary facade such that when viewed from the road the dwelling appears to be a detached singlefamily dwelling the planning board will consider alternatives to achieve the same goal of creating a dwelling that appears to be a detached singlefamily dwelling when viewed from the street when more than one inclusion onsite unit is sited in a single building the building shall be equal in gross floor area to a typical marketrate detached singlefamily dwelling in the development in order to achieve general comparability of scale and built form the purpose of this requirement is to assure that inclusion units will be generally indistinguishable from marketrate units b inclusion onsite units must be comparable to marketrate units in exterior building materials and finishes construction quality and energy efficiency including mechanical equipment and plumbing insulation windows and heating and cooling systems however inclusion units may have different interior finishes and features c  3159 general provisions  31510   31511 preservation of affordability provided that such finishes and features are durable of good quality and consistent with contemporary standards for new housing the planning board reserves the right to consult with the building inspector to verify the durability and quality of interior finishes proposed by the applicant and to require reasonable changes to better achieve comparability of units for homeownership developments a comparable inclusion onsite unit may be made available for rent to a low or moderateincome tenant at an affordable rent the ordinance does not specify that comparable requires a  relationship between the form of ownership or occupancy for marketrate units and inclusion units an applicant who plans to provide a comparable unit for rent rather than for sale must provide evidence satisfactory to the planning board that the rental unit will be managed by a qualified entity that has prior successful property management experience with affordable housing d affordable housing units created by the inclusionary housing be eligible for listing on the subsidized housing inventory toward that end the applicant is required to enter into a regulatory agreement with the city of beverly and dhcd the planning board encourages that applicants use the states model regulatory agreement which is not part of these regulations and is attached for informational purposes only see appendix b199 to reduce delays applicants are required to submit a draft regulatory agreement with the inclusionary housing application so that regulatory agreement details can be worked out during the permitting process it is the applicants responsibility to prepare a complete regulatory agreement for signature by the city and dhcd to obtain the necessary signatures and to record a fully executed agreement at the registry of deeds prior to the issuance of any building permits or in the case of a subdivision lot releases a in addition forsale units must be protected by a deed rider that locks in an affordable housing purchase price upon resale the city encourages applicants to use the states model affordable housing deed rider see appendix c200 applicants are required to submit a draft affordable housing deed rider with the inclusionary housing application so that details can be worked out during the permitting process this document must be fully executed and submitted to the planning department prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and must also be recorded with the registry of deeds at the time of transfer of ownership b finally the regulatory agreement requires an annual monitoring procedure to verify that affordable homeownership units remain owner c 199 editors note appendix b is included as an attachment to this

moderateincome tenants at rents they can afford the applicant is responsible for making monitoring arrangements with an organization qualified to provide this service on behalf of the city since dhcd will not approve affordable housing units for inclusion in the subsidized housing inventory unless a satisfactory monitoring plan is in place it is in the applicants interest to purchase this service from a qualified organization dhcd requires that all eligible housing units be sold or rented under an approved marketing plan the purpose of the marketing plan is to assure that as many qualified incomeeligible homebuyers or tenants as are reasonably possible are aware of an affordable housing opportunity and that the units will be made available on a nondiscriminatory basis a although there are many low or moderateincome households seeking affordable housing the marketing process is sometimes difficult as an aid to applicants the planning board has included sample marketing plan information in an exhibit to these regulations see appendix d201 it is the applicants responsibility to prepare a final marketing plan provide a draft for review by the planning board and submit the final plan to dhcd for its approval the marketing plan must be approved by dhcd prior to the issuance of any occupancy permits andor lot releases b 201 editors note appendix d is included as an

protection  vernal pools and 100foot nodisturbance zones vernal pools and their associated habitat including the 100foot nodisturbance zone as defined above are significant to the protection of wildlife habitat and rare plant and animal habitat vernal pools constitute a unique and increasingly rare type of wetland that is inhabited by many species of wildlife some of which are totally dependent on vernal pools and their associated habitat for their survival areas in the immediate vicinity of the vernal pool including but not necessarily limited to the 100foot nodisturbance zone and the airspace above provide these species with important nonbreeding habitat functions such as migratory pathways feeding shelter and overwintering sites many species utilize vernal pools and their associated 100foot nodisturbance zone for breeding and nonbreeding functions although they are not restricted to this type of wetland the protection of vernal pools and their associated 100foot nodisturbance zone are essential for the survival of wildlife species that depend on these unique and threatened resource areas the ordinance and these regulations protect all vernal pools whether or not they have been certified as such by the massachusetts division of fisheries and wildlife and whether or not they are regulated under 310 cmr 10572 a definition critical characteristics and boundary vernal pools exhibit a tremendous variation in physical dimensional geographic hydrologic and vegetative conditions and therefore for the purposes of this ordinance a vernal pool is a freshwater body that in most years or all years in some cases holds water for a minimum of two months and that is free of established reproducing fish populations and meets either of the following criteria the vernal pool contains evidence of the presence of any one or more of the following obligate indicator species spotted salamander bluespotted salamander jefferson salamander marbled salamander wood frog or fairy shrimp  1 in the absence of evidence of the presence of any obligate indicator species the vernal pool contains evidence of two or more of any of the following facultative indicator species spring peeper american toad green frog pickerel frog gray tree frog fourtoed salamander spotted turtle caddisfly larvae or cases of caddisfly larvae dragonfly or damselfly larvae or shed skins exuvia of dragonfly or damselfly larvae adults juveniles or shells of either fingernail clams or amphibious airbreathing snails isopods 2 b c evidence collection  5658 general provisions  5658  timing many of the indicators of vernal pool habitat are seasonal for example certain salamander egg clusters are only found between late march and late may wood frog chorusing only occurs between late march and late may and then typically at night consequently failure to find evidence of breeding or the presence of the indicator species specified above only has evidentiary value if the investigation is conducted during those periods in which breeding is likely to occur or when the indicator species are likely to be present the commission may require that the pool be investigated at least two times during these months but not two consecutive days in a row 1 should any area that the commission believes may function as a vernal pool contain any of the following characteristics when dry the area shall be presumed to contain a vernal pool and shall be reinvestigated in the spring during vernal pool breeding season as described above a stained leaves in a depression  water stains or siltation marks on surrounding tree trunks or vegetation  b c trees with buttressed trunks or stilt trunks  d wetland plants or sphagnum moss growing in a dry depression  e wetland or hydric soils  f cases of caddisfly larvae trichoptera  adults juveniles or shells of either freshwater clams pisidiidae or amphibious airbreathing snails  g shed skins or exuvia of dragonfly or damselfly larvae on vegetation along the edge of the dry depression h 2 to overcome the presumption of significance provided for in  5658d the commission may require that the determination be postponed until evidence is compiled during the appropriate time period as described above the commission may also require its own site visits as necessary to confirm any evidence presented to it 3 the commission may accept and consider evidence that is not in strict compliance with these requirements if it deems the evidence to be credible and relevant 4 presumptions of significance where a proposed activity involves the removing filling dredging or altering of a vernal pool its 100foot nodisturbance zone or the airspace above the vernal pool or 100foot nodisturbance zone the commission shall presume that the vernal pool and its 100foot nodisturbance zone are significant to the protection d  5658 beverly code  5658  of wildlife habitat and rare plant and animal habitat this presumption may be overcome by the applicants presentation of evidence sufficient to demonstrate by a preponderance of credible evidence that the vernal pool or its 100foot nodisturbance zone or some portion of it does not play a role in the protection of said interests in the event the presumption is deemed by the commission to have been overcome the commission shall make a written determination to this effect setting forth its grounds performance standards for areas in which the presumption set forth in  5658d of these regulations is not overcome the following standards shall apply to vernal pools and their 100foot nodisturbance zones vernal pool and 100foot nodisturbance zone for vernal pools no activity shall be permitted within or above 1 the vernal pool 2 the 100foot nodisturbance zone for vernal pools or 3 in the case of a vernal pool located within another wetland resource area  5653a1 3 4 5 the area extending 100 feet of the delineated edge of that wetland resource area prohibited activities include but are not limited to grading landscaping vegetation control pruning cutting filling excavation shading roadway construction andor driveway construction it is the opinion of the commission that due to the uniqueness of vernal pool resource areas protecting the associated 100foot nodisturbance zone for vernal pools is necessary to protect wildlife and rare plant and animal habitat as noted in the definition of the 100foot nodisturbance zone for vernal pools in  5657 the commission may change the regulated extent and location of this nodisturbance zone based on the results of a biological andor habitat evaluation which may be required to determine the migratory pathways and other important habitat usage of vernal pool breeders these performance standards also do not apply to those portions of the 100foot nodisturbance zone for vernal pools that the commission has determined under  5658d are not significant to the protection of wildlife habitat and rare plant and animal habitat 1 onehundredfoot septic system setback components of subsurface sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted within 100 feet of the delineated edge of a vernal pool or the delineated edge of the encompassing wetland resource area when the proposed system is located upgradient of the vernal pool 2 nodisturbance zone demarcation to maintain the perpetual integrity of the 100foot nodisturbance zone for vernal pools and to ensure that there will be no encroachments into this zone by the applicant or future owners of the subject property the commission may require the nodisturbance zone to be marked on the ground at the applicants expense with permanent markers these markers shall be made of weatherresistant material ie granite or concrete and the commission shall determine their number location and size the commission may require one or more of 3 e  5658 general provisions  5658   5659 isolated vegetated wetlands these markers to bear on their upland side writing ie a permanent plaque or engraving that shall read no disturbance beyond this point by order of the beverly conservation commission migratory pathway of vernal pool breeders work or final project elements shall not be allowed that obstruct the migratory pathways of vernal pool breeding species 4 isolated vegetated wetlands are likely to be significant to the interests identified in 310 cmr 10551 that are supported by bordering vegetated wetlands and other interests identified in the ordinance including protection of private and public water supply and groundwater flood control storm damage prevention prevention of pollution protection of fisheries wildlife habitat erosion and sedimentation control and rare plant and animal habitat a definition critical characteristics and boundary isolated vegetated wetlands protected under the ordinance are freshwater wetlands of at least 1000 square feet in area that do not border on creeks rivers streams ponds or lakes and that do not qualify as a vernal pool under  5658 in which case the area will be regulated as a vernal pool the types of isolated vegetated wetlands include but are not limited to wet meadows marshes swamps and bogs in addition to the minimum size requirement isolated vegetated wetlands must also meet at least two of the following three criteria the vegetation community of an isolated vegetated wetland consists of 50% or more wetland indicator plants wetland indicator plants are classified in the following categories facultative facultative + facultative wetland  facultative wetland facultative wetland + or obligate wetland source us fish and wildlife service  or 1 other indicators of hydrology including site inundation or saturation water marks drift lines sediment deposits oxidized rhizospheres waterstained leaves shallow root systems buttressed tree trunks and recorded hydrologic data stream gauge aerial photo or other  or 2 3 presence of hydric soils b presumption of significance where a proposed activity involves the removing filling dredging or altering of an isolated vegetated wetland or land within the 100foot buffer zone to an isolated vegetated wetland the commission shall presume that the isolated vegetated wetland is significant to the interests specified in  5659a of these regulations this presumption may be overcome by the applicants presentation of evidence sufficient to demonstrate by a preponderance c  5658 beverly code  5659   56510 buffer zones of credible evidence that the isolated vegetated wetland does not play a role in the protection of said interests if the commission finds that this presumption has been overcome it shall make a written determination to this effect setting forth its grounds performance standards when the presumption set forth in of this section is not overcome any proposed work in the isolated vegetated wetlands shall comply with the following performance standards no alteration or impairment of isolated vegetated wetland no activity is permitted within or above an isolated vegetated wetland no activity is permitted within the associated 100foot buffer zone that is likely to destroy or otherwise impair the isolated vegetated wetland 1 25foot nodisturbance zone work within the area extending 25 feet from the edge of the isolated vegetated wetland shall be subject to the 25foot nodisturbance zone standards and demarcation requirements set forth in  56510d2 2 d findings buffer zones are likely to be significant to the interests identified in the ordinance including protection of private and public water supply and groundwater flood control storm damage prevention prevention of pollution protection of fisheries wildlife habitat prevention and control of erosion and sedimentation and the protection of rare plant and animal species habitat and recreation buffer zones are protected resource areas under the ordinance because they play a vital role in protecting the adjacent resource areas and also provide their own important functions in many ways including but not limited to the following scattering sunlight and providing shade thereby lowering water temperature within wetlands and adjacent areas  a slowing water flow thereby decreasing water velocities allowing infiltration and reducing the erosion potential of stormwater runoff  b storing water thereby helping to maintain stream base flow and provide water quality benefits during low flow periods  c trapping and filtering sediment and other contaminants ie pesticides heavy metals etc  d producing leaf litter and biomass which increases the humus content of the soil and increases absorption and infiltration  e f providing essential habitat for wetlandassociated species  1 a  5659 general provisions  56510  reducing nutrient overloading by filtering nutrients bound to sediment in the surface flow and removing nutrients from groundwater in vegetation  and g h protecting adjacent resource areas projects located in close proximity to a wetland have a high likelihood of resulting in adverse impacts to the wetland itself either immediately as a consequence of construction or over time as a consequence of daily operation or maintenance of the completed project such adverse impacts typically result from activities including but not limited to extension of lawns depositingdumping
