specific prohibitions in a2c r if it can be proved that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass   or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents form the users prior discharge when the village was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 for the purpose of this section a bypass means the intentional diversion of water streams from any portion of a users treatment facility b

been received within twentyfour 24 hours 5 bypass is prohibited and the director of public works or designee may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there was no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under of this section 6

prior ordinance history  findings the board of trustees of the village finds that a excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainageways and the creation of recreational facilities  b the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  c soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gulleys washedout fills and embankments  d sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes wetlands and reservoirs  e sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  and f sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety   part purpose the board of trustees declares that the purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter is to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in the village it is the intention of this chapter that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by land disturbing activities be limited as closely as practicable to that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural undisturbed state   part definitions for the purposes of

maintenance of the land itself village means the village of cary mchenry county illinois wetlands means areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation adapted for life in saturated soil conditions   part general principles it is the objective of this chapter to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities including clearing grading stripping excavating and filling of land in the village measures taken to control soil erosion and offsite sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten 10 year frequency or less the following principles shall apply to all development activities within the village and to the preparation of the submissions required under a development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible b natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses lakes ponds and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible temporary crossings of watercourses when permitted must include appropriate stabilization measures c special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream lake pond or wetland preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation d the smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development e sediment basins or traps filter barriers diversions and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development f the selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion and on evaluation of the risks costs and benefits involved g in the design of erosion control facilities and practices aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered h provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on site or downstream i permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during development j those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development k all waste generated as a result of site development activity should be property disposed of and should be prevented from being carried off the site by either wind or water l all construction sites should provide measures to prevent sediment from being tracked onto public or private roadways   part site

singlefamily residential el r1 r1a r2 districts the singlefamily residential districts are designed to accommodate singlefamily detached residential uses other than mobile homes on lots or parcels having different dimensional requirements these districts may also accommodate some institutional uses which directly serve the singlefamily residential community and which provide it with a sense of neighborhood such as schools and churches   part multifamily residential r3 district the multifamily residential district is intended to accommodate multifamily and singlefamily attached residential uses it also may accommodate some other moderately intensive uses that can be sited without posing an adverse impact on the multifamily and singlefamily attached residential uses it also may accommodate some group homes and care facilities which need a stable residential area in order to foster the adjustment of persons back into the community it allows a broader range of institutional uses than would be allowed in the singlefamily residential districts   part business b1 b2 b3 b3r b4 bp districts the purpose of the business districts is to accommodate a range of commercial activities a the b1 district is designed to accommodate the needs of the existing central business district with a broad range of office and retail uses substantial limitations on storage uses and some incentives for multifamily residential use the district recognizes the zero lot line nature of past development it makes allowances for residential redevelopment of stories above the ground floor it recognizes the importance of the architectural elements in contributing to the ambience and health of the district b the b2 district is designed to accommodate general retail and selected service uses in shopping centers these districts are intended to be nodal in nature these areas should be greater than twentyfive 25 acres in size and located at the intersection of arterials or arterials and collectors they are not intended for development on small tracts adjacent to and along arterials c the b3 district is designed to accommodate general retail and service uses along major arterials the district is intended to serve as a transition between major highways such as us 14 and singlefamily residential uses these districts should be located along selected major arterials particularly those where some general retail and service uses have already occurred and where the use of the district would encourage an infill of those commercial uses the district provides for adaptive reuse of structures formerly in residential use and the development of vacant parcels that are too small for shopping centers the district is also intended to serve as a transition between the central business district and the singlefamily residential uses because of these transitional functions it is viewed as a fringe district the b3 district recognizes that some strip commercial development may be appropriate d the b3r district is designed to further the purposes of the b3 district in addition it recognizes that this area has some particularly attractive architectural features which should be retained that redevelopment and changing uses in the area might pose a greater impact on the surrounding residential area because of its close proximity and for that reason the range of permitted uses needs to be narrower and that singlefamily residential uses currently exist and are encouraged to remain e the b4 district is designed to address neighborhood as opposed to community commercial needs the b4 districts should be located on arterials and at an appropriate distance from other commercial districts so as to discourage future strip commercial development between the districts b4 nodes should be limited to less than five 5 acres f the bp district is designed to address the needs for office research and light industrial uses in a business park setting   part   8192003 manufacturing m

public point of view these standards must be read in conjunction with the table dimensional standards see table 1726 addressing all uses where there is a conflict between the two 2 standards unless the supplemental standard specifically provides otherwise the more restrictive standard applies   part   2172009 article i  multifamily and singlefamily attached dwellings density a the maximum allowable density in dwelling units per acre for multifamily and singlefamily attached residential dwellings as measured on the predevelopment tract is as follows density by zoning district lot size

owner of a large tract of land who sets out an integrated comprehensive plan of development for the entire tract of land involving residential and other uses substantial open space and amenities   part general standards a the overall plan of the development must be comprehensive embracing land buildings landscaping and their interrelationships and must conform with the comprehensive plan of the village b the plan must provide for adequate open space circulation offstreet parking and pertinent amenities buildings structures and facilities in the development must be well integrated oriented and related to the topographic and natural landscape features of the site c the development must be compatible with existing and planned uses and with circulation patterns on adjoining properties it must not constitute a disruptive element to the neighborhood or community d the internal street system must not be a dominant feature in the overall design but it should be designed for the efficient and safe flow of vehicles without creating a disruptive influence on the activity and function of any common areas and facilities e the common areas and recreational facilities must be located so as to be readily accessible to the occupants of the dwelling units and must be well related to any common open spaces provided f the architectural harmony within the development neighborhood and community must be achieved to the extent practicable   part specific standards a tract size the predevelopment tract must consist of at least forty 40 acres the predevelopment tract is as defined in the tract size shall not be reduced except as provided in the master plan b master plan the development will include a master plan which shall delineate general use areas such as residential commercial industrial or park and shall indicate a set of specific uses pertinent to that use area and the standards for development that will apply the developer may satisfy this requirement by indicating that in a particular use area the table of uses and dimensional standards for a particular district shall apply the developer should identify any standard in the subdivision ordinance see title 16 that will not be complied with and the extent of the noncompliance the master plan will have the same level of detail as a preliminary plat under the subdivision ordinance and shall be processed and comply in all respects with that ordinance the words planned development shall appear in the title of any plat seeking to use this style of development c gross density except to the extent that it may be increased by the bonus density provision set out in of this section the maximum density of the development shall not exceed the standard for residential density as set out in the table of dimensional standards table 1726 for the zoning district in which the planned development lies the maximum number of dwelling units which can be built in the planned development is calculable by multiplying the net developable acreage by the density for the district as set out in that table the net developable acreage is the gross acreage less any lands in floodway regulatory wetlands detention dry ponds and street rightsofway land in nonresidential uses other than open space uses such as golf courses polo fields and the like shall not constitute more than ten percent 10% of the planned development nonresidential uses shall be intended to primarily serve other uses in the planned development d bonus density the gross density of the development as set out in the table of dimensional standards table 1726 may be increased by up to thirty percent 30% for developments that have exceptionally attractive elements of design unusual amenities that will build and dedicate infrastructure beyond that needed to serve the development and that would create substantial revenues from sources other than property taxes for the village e dimensional deviations notwithstanding subsection b of this section and except as provided in this subsection any lot created shall be developed so as to at least meet the table of dimensional standards table 1726 for the r2 district the minimum lot area of lots abutting a common open space may be further reduced by twentythree percent 23% provided that the standards related to open space in of this section are complied with furthermore to the extent that the planned development includes site elevations and footprints for buildings planned on adjacent lots the side and rear yard setbacks between those lots may be further reduced to the same extent as allowable under the provisions for architecturally integrated subdivisions as set out in of this chapter in order to take advantage of this article the developer shall submit architectural drawings consistent with comply with the standards in that section any reference to preliminary plat in that section shall be deemed to refer to the master plan under this article f exterior lots any lot to be created in the planned development which is adjacent to a lot or tract of land not in the planned development tract shall be developed consistent with the standards of the zoning district in which that tract lies or those of the r2 district whichever is more restrictive g street classification the master plan will classify each segment of street for purpose of this article streets with a significantly different cross section may be classified differently notwithstanding they generally belong to the same class of street thus where a master plan incorporates a local street with a vegetated median and one without the plan might include both a local a and a local b class street h building line where the plan does not indicate where the principal buildings will be located the development shall set forth a building line which shall be the same distance from the rightofway for each class of street at least a part of the front elevation of every principal building will be located within five 5 feet of that line i bike andor pedestrian trails the development will provide a fully improved offstreet bike andor pedestrian system which winds throughout the development and where practical shall be extended to adjoining developments and connected to existing bike or pedestrian trails j open space the amount of useable open space shall exceed forty percent 40% of the development in addition any land saved from reductions allowed in of this section shall be set aside as useable open space any open space created shall be placed in a property owners association or shall with the villages consent be placed in the ownership of a single entity or be dedicated to the village or another public or quasipublic entity in the event that the property is placed in a nonpublic entity the developer will provide covenants that the property will not be developed and that it will be maintained as open space in a manner consistent with the master plan k special studies required any plan submitted shall provide and be accompanied by any information necessary for the full review of the proposal in addition to the information required for site plans under the following information shall be provided demographic analysis identifying the projected population and number of school age children  traffic impact analysis indicating peak and average daily trips added to the road network places of impact and the ability of the receiving roads to accommodate the trips  and a fiscal impact analysis projecting the increase in revenues and expenses to the village from the development l emergency access because of the flexibility allowed in this article every planned development shall be required to demonstrate that the village and other emergency service providers will have adequate access to each building for purpose of police and fire protection    part article iii  cluster and architecturally integrated subdivisions intent the purpose of this article is to provide flexibility consistent with the public health and safety and without increasing overall density to the developer who subdivides property and aggregates his or her open space in one or more tracts thereby providing enhanced recreational benefits to his or her development and enhanced protection of natural features such as wetlands or wooded areas and in the case of architecturally integrated subdivisions constructs buildings on the lots created in accordance with a unified plan of development   part general standards a cluster in any subdivision of a tract consisting of ten 10 acres of land or more the developer may create lots which deviate from the minimum lot size and lot width  except that the dimensional standards for any lot created shall not be reduced below the dimensional standards of the next most intensive district 1 for purpose of this section the next most intensive district is as follows district next most intensive district e1 r1 r1 r1a r1a r2 r2 r3 other r3 2 furthermore the developer shall demonstrate that at least ten percent 10% of the tract is characterized by significant natural features deserving protection and that for the most part those areas will be placed into open space the words cluster shall appear in the title of any plat seeking to use this style of development 3 for purpose of this section the lot area of the r3 district shall be construed as being twentytwo and onehalf percent 2212% less than the lot area of the r2 district and the lot width of the r3 district shall be construed as the same as the r2 district b architecturally integrated subdivision in any cluster subdivision the developer may create lots and construct buildings which deviate from the minimum side and rear yard setbacks except for those lots abutting land that is not part of the subdivision the development will comply with the standards for cluster set out in of this section the words architecturally integrated subdivision shall appear in the title of any plat seeking to use this style of development   part  part   8192003 density the number of lots or dwelling units allowed in a cluster or architecturally integrated subdivision shall not exceed the number obtained by multiplying the net developable acreage by the density for the district as set out in the table of dimensional standards located at table 1726 the net developable acreage is the gross acreage less any lands in floodway regulatory wetlands detention dry ponds and street rightsofway   part  part usable open space to the extent reasonably practicable the amount of land saved by creating lots that are smaller than the standards set forth in table 1726 shall be set aside as usable open space furthermore the amount of usable open space provided shall exceed forty percent 40% of the development at least seventyfive percent 75% of the lots that are reduced in size shall be adjacent to the open space created any open space created shall be placed in a property owners association or shall with the villages consent be dedicated to the village or another public entity   part   8192003   2172009 emergency access because of the flexibility allowed in this article every architecturally integrated subdivision shall be required to demonstrate that the village and other emergency service providers will have adequate access to each dwelling unit for purpose of police and fire protection   part architectural drawings where a developer proposes to use the architecturally integrated style of development to deviate from the yard requirements in this title any preliminary plat submitted shall be accompanied by architectural drawings showing the facades and footprints of the proposed structures these drawings may be roughly drawn at the preliminary plat stage with the focus on window placement orientation and distance between buildings and with provisions addressing privacy these matters will be more definitively addressed in submittals accompanying the final plan every development will provide at least five 5 different front facades   part commercial and industrial performance standards a smoke for the purpose of determining the density or equivalent opacity of smoke the ringlemann chart as adopted and published by the united states department of interior bureau of mines info circular 833 may 196 shall be used the ringlemann number referred to in this section refers to the number of the area on the ringlemann chart that coincides most nearly with the visual density or equivalent opacity of the emission of the smoke observed for example a reading of ringlemann no 1 indicates a twenty percent 20% density of the smoke observed all measurements shall be taken at the point of emission of the smoke 1 in all districts other than the m district no industrial uses table 1723 in  shall emit from a vent stack chimney or combustible process any smoke that is visible to the naked eye 2 in the m district no shall emit from a vent stack chimney or combustible process any smoke that exceeds a density or equivalent capacity of ringlemann no 1 except that an emission of ringlemann no 2 is permissible for a duration of not more than four 4 minutes during any eight 8 hour period if the source of the emission is not located within two hundred fifty 250 feet of a residential district b noise a decibel is a measure of unit of sound pressure since sound waves which have the same decibel level seem louder or softer to the human ear depending upon the frequency of the sound wave in cycles per second ie whether the pitch of the sound is high or low an aweighted filter constructed in accordance with the specifications of the american national standards institute which automatically takes account of the varying effect on the human ear of different pitches shall be used on any sound level meter taking measurements required by this section accordingly all measurements expressed in this section are expressed in dba to reflect the use of this aweighted filter the standards established in the table set out below are expressed in terms of the equivalent sound level leq which must be calculated by taking one hundred 100 instantaneous aweighted sound levels at ten 10 second intervals see appendix a1 and computing the leq in accordance with the table set forth in appendix a2 1 no table 1723 in  use may generate any noise in a district other than an m district that tends to have an annoying or disruptive effect upon uses located on adjacent lots or other uses on the same lot 2 except as provided in of this section the table below establishes the maximum permitted noise level for a in an m district measurements shall be taken at the boundary of the lot

511131 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to provide for the regulation of nonconforming lots uses buildings and structures and to specify the circumstances and conditions under which those nonconforming buildings structures uses and lots may continue or shall be gradually eliminated in accordance with the authority granted by state statutes   part   572013 1 the ordinance codified in takes a more liberal approach to nonconforming uses this change is justified under the theory that nonconforming situations do not fade away they just become more run down thus the choice is more realistically one of a bad nonconformity versus a better nonconformity continuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects nonconforming situations that were lawful on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be continued subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in this chapter nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of seq   part   572013 2 see for definitions of nonconforming situations and nonconforming projects nonconforming lots where a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot cannot meet the minimum lot area or lot width requirement set out in table 1726 then the lot may be used just as if it were conforming however no use that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size in the particular district is permissible on the nonconforming lot where a nonconforming lot is adjacent to another lot which was in the same ownership at any time between the creation of the nonconforming status and that of the application for a permit under this chapter then neither the owner of the lot or his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section    572013 3 in many older subdivisions lots were intended to be combined to form a buildable lot extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations 4 nonconforming situations include nonconforming lots structures and uses extension of nonconforming situation prohibited a except as specifically provided in this chapter no person may engage in any developmental action that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in either 1 an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use  or 2 a greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions b where a nonconforming situation exists the volume intensity or frequency of use of the property may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location may be changed provided these or similar changes amount only to a change in the degree as opposed to kind of activity c a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming a nonconforming use of a structure may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building which at the time the use became nonconforming was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate the use d notwithstanding the above any nonconforming structure used for singlefamily residential purposes may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities   part   572013 5 the ordinance codified in this permits the replacement of a deteriorated singlefamily residence with a new larger one providing new nonconformities are not created or existing ones enlarged repair maintenance and reconstruction repairs encouraged minor repairs to and routine maintenance of structures where nonconforming situations exist are permitted a major renovation is one were the costs of renovation are more than the assessed valuation   part   572013 facade alterations encouraged alterations to the facades of structures where nonconforming situations exist are permitted provided they are consistent with the design standards set out in seq   part   572013 reconstruction of damaged residential singlefamily dwelling units in the event that a building exclusively in residential use in a residential district is partially or totally damaged that residential dwelling unit may be rebuilt or replaced by another unit as long as the use is conforming and the replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities and further provided that work is started within one 1 year of the occurrence and is diligently pursued to completion   part   8192003   572013 6 assessed valuation is the value placed on the building for real property tax purposes by mchenry county as a general rule of thumb the assessed value is thirty percent 30% of the fair market value reconstruction of other residential dwelling units and of nonresidential buildings in the event that a building in nonresidential use is damaged to the extent that cost of restoration to the condition in which it was before the occurrence will exceed two 2 times the assessed valuation of the building at that time then any construction must comply with all the standards of this chapter if the extent of the damage is less than that set out above the building may be restored or reconstructed provided that the construction will not create any new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities and further provided that work is started within one 1 year of the occurrence and is diligently pursued to completion   part   8192003   572013 change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists a nonconforming nonstructural use of the land may not be changed to any use but a conforming use when a nonconforming use of the land or a structure has been changed to a conforming use it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use   part   572013 moving no building or structure shall be moved in whole or part to any other location unless every portion of such building or structure and the use thereof is made to conform to all regulations in this chapter   part   572013 abandonment of a nonconforming use whenever any nonconforming use is discontinued for a period in excess of one hundred eighty 180 days with an intent to abandon the use any future use shall be limited to those uses permitted under this chapter the vacancy or nonuse of the land or structure shall be presumed to constitute a discontinuance under this provision   part   572013 7 the abandonment of all uses for a structure does not make the structure itself or the lot illegal completion of nonconforming projects vested rights of outstanding building projects nothing in this chapter shall require any change in the plans construction size or designated use of any building structure or part thereof for which a building permit zoning permit or a conditional use permit has been validly issued and which remains valid    572013 vested rights of other projects except as provided in all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects shall be revoked as of that date thereafter work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a building permit zoning permit or conditional use permit issued in accordance with this section the permit issuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed his position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it previously existed at the time in which good faith reliance occurred and thereby would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete his project as proposed where a developers plans indicate an intent to build in phases his position shall be examined in respect to each phase in considering whether these findings may be made the permit issuing authority shall be guided by the following as well as other relevant considerations this chapter establishes the circumstances under which a vested right is obtained just as it does with respect to other nonconforming situations it directs the administrator to examine how the developers position is changed as a result of the change in this chapter a all expenditures made to obtain a building zoning or conditional use permit that was validly issued shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance furthermore a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if his action precedes a setting of a public hearing at which the change in the land use law was proposed b to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made the expenditures c to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made the expenditures d an expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of the total estimated costs of the proposed project notwithstanding the above in the event that the village has issued a building permit to use a structure in accordance with the law prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and where construction has begun within six 6 months of such effective date and is being prosecuted to completion the structure may be completed in accordance with approved plans on the basis of which the building permit was issued  and further upon completion may be occupied under a certificate of occupancy by the use originally designated   part   572013 relief the owner of any building structure or use which is subject to discontinuation or abandonment under the terms of this chapter may apply to the board of zoning planning and appeals for a conditional use to allow such building structure or use to continue or be reestablished in such event the procedures terms conditions and standards for conditional uses set forth in be used to evaluate the application  572013 8 the ordinance codified in this establishes the circumstances under which a vested right is obtained just as it does with respect to other nonconforming situations it directs the administrator to examine how the developers position is changed as a result of the change in the ordinance this chapter widens the range of vested rights situations however in order to take advantage of these rights the developer is required to present evidence showing detrimental reliance while not required an informal hearing to receive evidence is suggested chapter 1770  board review footnotes  3  state law reference board of appeals 65 ilcs 511133 creation and
