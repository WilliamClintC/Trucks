the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation b an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of c are met c a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating lots or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and 3 the user has submitted the following information to the township and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days i a description of

for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in  23330a of this the specific prohibitions in  23330b3 of this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or b no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the township was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements  23394 bypass 52006 restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails a for the purposes of this section 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to be inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections c and d of this section c if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass

bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including  23392 amity code  23394 ao360 exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the township may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours d bypass is prohibited and the township may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless 1 bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  2 there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and 3 the user submitted notices as required under c of this section the township after consulting with its consulting engineer may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if they determine that it will meet the three conditions listed in d above  23394

apply the surcharge formula for any of the above parameters depending on the parameters listed in its npdes permit  23400 additional surcharges 52006 the formula specified in  23399 of this to determine additional charges or surcharges for the treatment of wastes having concentrations of cbod5 suspended solids dissolved solids and ammonia nitrogen in excess of those of domestic waste it is however recognized that the discharge of any waste or other substance containing any one of the prohibited substances listed in  23330 may result in extraordinary laboratory labor maintenance andor treatment expenses to the township hence in the event of the discharge of any wastes or other matters or substance containing any one of the prohibited substances listed in  23330 or  23334 multiplied by the trc the township shall have the power to bill the owner of the property from which such discharge is made an additional surcharge of $300 each day that such discharge is made shall result in a

title 192008 this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the amity township stormwater management   25102 statement of findings 192008 the board of supervisors of the township of amity finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including minimization of impacts of development redevelopment and activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed poses a threat to surface and groundwater quality e stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality f impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality groundwater recharge stream baseflow and aquatic ecosystems the most cost effective and environmentally advantageous way to manage storm water runoff is project  25101 adopting ordinance  25102 ao393  25103 purpose 192008 the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within amity township by

buffers floodplains steep slopes and designing to topography and soils to maintain the natural hydrologic regime g public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater h federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes i nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the township a promote alternative project designs and layout that minimizes impacts to surface and ground water b promote nonstructural best management practices bmps c minimize increases in stormwater volume d minimize impervious surfaces e manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems f provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management g utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems h manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes i focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater
