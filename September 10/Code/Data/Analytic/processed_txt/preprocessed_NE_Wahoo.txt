fffw flood plain wahoo nebraska  zoning ordinance  2005 rev  80 fffw flood plain districts  statutory authorization the legislature of the state of nebraska has in rrs 1943 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the health safety and general welfare the legislature in to 311022 rrs 1943 as amended has further assigned the responsibility to adopt administer and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the floodprone area therefore the mayor and city council of the city of wahoo nebraska ordains as follows  findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of wahoo nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  methods used to analyze flood hazards this ordinance uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1 selection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood is selected for this ordinance it is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations flood insurance study saunders county nebraska and incorporated areas and illustrative materials dated  as amended 2 calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood 3 computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point 4 delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile 5 delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in 2 by applying the provisions of this ordinance to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities 2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction 3 protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard 4 assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program  zoning administrator responsibilities 1 the zoning administrator hereby has these added responsibilities and is authorized and directed to enforce all of the provisions of this all other ordinances of the city of wahoo now in force or hereafter adopted related to zoning subdivision or building codes 2 the

develop granted by the city of wahoo or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city of wahoo or the designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in 1b and 2b the boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the flood insurance rate map or floodway map where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions the zoning administrator shall make the necessary interpretation in such cases where the interpretation is contested the board of adjustments will resolve the dispute the regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the board of adjustments and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires along watercourses where a floodway has been established the mapped floodplain areas are hereby divided into the two following districts a floodway overlay district fw and a flood fringe overlay district ff as identified in the flood insurance study and accompanying maps within these districts all uses not meeting the

activity  policy statement the planning commission and city council have received requests to site towers and antennas the purpose of this to provide specific regulations for the placement construction and modification of radio television and personal wireless service facilities the provisions of this not intended to and shall not be interpreted to prohibit or to have the effect of prohibiting the provision of radio television and personal wireless services nor shall the provisions of this applied in such a manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally equivalent services the goals of this to i encourage the location of towers on public property and in nonresidential areas and to minimize the total number of towers throughout the city  ii encourage strongly the joint use of new and existing tower sites  iii encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the city is minimal  iv encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the visual impact of the towers and antennas  and v enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services throughout the city quickly effectively and efficiently accordingly the city council finds that the promulgation of this warranted and necessary to manage the location of
