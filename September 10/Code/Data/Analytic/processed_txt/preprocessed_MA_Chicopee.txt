reduce and eventually eliminate sewer surcharging and potential backups into homes buildings the removal of the groundwater and wet weather water from the combined sewer system andor installation of approved sewer backup prevention devices will enhance the health and safety of our environment the reductionremoval of wet weather flows from the combined sewer system allows for the city to only treat actual sanitary sewer flow and reduces the costs associated with treating sewage for all rate payers the sewer backup prevention program is intended to separate the inflow and infiltration from building footings foundation drains and roof leader connections from the sanitary sewer system when heavy rains continuous wet weather sudden thunderstorms or downpours occur  the combined sewer system may become surcharged surcharging is the overfilling or overloading of the designed pipe capacity the overloading of the pipe causes the incoming flow to slow down and sometimes back up the causes of the surcharging are attributed to several factors such as combined onepipe sanitary and drain sewer system  foundation and footing drains of homes directly connected to the sewer system introducing constant groundwater flow into the sewer system  roof leaders and gutters that are directly connected to the sewer system allowing rain water from outside of the building to enter the sewer system by removing the outside water sources from the combined sewer system andor installation of approved sewer backup prevention devices the potential for surcharging is reduced considerably during wet weather events 1 authority the commission is authorized to establish the sewer backup prevention and cost sharing program and promulgate administrative rules and policies to implement the program 2 program elements the program must contain the following elements a description and overview of the program criteria to be used by the city to determine eligibility for the program b c
