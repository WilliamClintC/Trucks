niantic village introduction niantic is a traditional new england village within the community of east lyme with unique qualities and a strong sense of place it has small and cohesive neighborhoods  a vibrant main street  extensive waterfront with marinas beaches and a public walkway which promotes extensive pedestrian access along niantic bay the village center has historically functioned as the social civic and commercial center of the community these characteristics in themselves constitute a sense of place which contributes to the high quality of livability of the village a physically and aesthetically enhanced village also typically results in increased property values these values ultimately reflect on the degree of a places desirability purpose the purpose of these architectural guidelines is to provide a framework for design that draws inspiration from the traditions of niantic and similarly situated new england seacoast communities they promote safe functional and attractive development of the village district enhance the public experience and grow and protect the commercial property values by beautifying the communities appearance these design standards establish guidelines for new or renovated commercial buildings that will preserve and augment the new england character of the niantic village architectural design design new buildings and renovations should be designed to fit the specific characteristics of their particular site the architecture should be influenced by traditional new england building forms and town making patterns the specific needs of the intended users the nature of the intended use and other site specific factors all buildings shall follow fundamental architectural principles of scale massing and appropriate detail and special attention will be paid to the essential elements of building design these elements include but are not limited to foundations  windows doors and shutters  porches stoops entries and railings  siding and trim  roofs and dormers  and appurtenances such as chimneys gutters and downspouts columns vents exterior lighting and building identification the overall architectural character of any proposed building design should be in harmony with the neighborhood in which such activity is taking place or accomplish as a transition in character between areas of unlike character protects property values in the neighborhood and preserves and enhances the beauty of the community its integrity and architecture human scale buildings and site elements should be designed to human scale the forms massing and openings of buildings should be proportional to the size of a human figure many architectural elements can add scale to a building  watertables planters recessed openings divided pane windows building mounted light fixtures dormers cupolas projecting rooflines covered walkways colonnades and similar features  provided they are designed as integral parts of the overall structure freestanding accessory structures where freestanding nonhabitable structures are allowed eg atms garages service stations canopies storage units recycling sheds trash enclosures cart corrals utility buildings they should meet the same design standards as the principal building of architectural forms materials colors and detailing guide line criteria the following criteria should be considered in all the designs designs should be in keeping with the architectural fabric of the cb zone and niantic village design guidelines design massing scale & proportions a good example of an active commercial block visually interesting balanced modest in scale with many architectural elements building design should incorporate features that add visual interest to the building while reducing the appearance of bulk or mass buildings should avoid long monotonous uninterrupted walls or roofs on their visible facades they also should avoid long expanses of repetitive architectural elements whether symmetrical or asymmetrical the buildings facades should be balanced in their composition with the objective of maintaining a smalltown character buildings should appear to be modest in scale relating to the scale of the immediate surroundings the massing of larger commercial buildings should be deemphasized by the use of projecting and recessed sections to reduce their apparent overall bulk an example of a balanced and wellproportioned building the mass of buildings can be reduced by further introducing smallscale architectural features the use of shutters columns and chimneys on building elevations and similar features help to establish a human scale at the street level architectural style and detail buildings may be either traditional in their architectural character or a contemporary expression of traditional styles and forms buildings should articulate the line between the ground and upper levels with a cornice canopy balcony arcade or other architectural features the cornice andor parapet is an area where architectural detail and materials are important as they can add distinctiveness and visual emphasis to a building but they should be consistent with the body of the design in scale and detail cupola visually appealing faade in the greek revival architectural style visually interesting roof of a commercial building the use of special architectural elements such as but not limited to towers & turrets muntins & window shutters chimneys and dormers etc is encouraged at major street corners to accent structures and provide visual interest storefront welldesigned storefronts add vitality to the streetscape encouraging pedestrian as well as vehicular traffic retail storefronts should make generous use of glass face the street or sidewalk and not be obstructed by piers or other features that block view of the display windows carefully designed awnings coupled with appropriately scaled signage and lighting will further enhance the storefronts appearance roof types it is characteristic of traditional new england architecture that smallerscaled structures have roofs that are sloped and articulated with dormers chimneys gables cupolas fascias etc verticallyaligned windows and entrances larger structures likewise can benefit from similar treatment that breaks up the massing into appropriately scaled elements avoid large flatroofed areas or conceal them behind parapets or sections of sloped roof windows fenestration arrangement of windows on the wall should be architecturally related to the style materials colors and details of the building windows and door openings should be proportioned so that verticals dominate horizontals to the extent possible upperstory windows shall be vertically aligned with the location of windows and doors on the ground level including storefront or display windows upper stories should incorporate window patterns and designs that are compatible with and complimentary to existing upperstory window patterns on the block window with muntins firstfloor window and display design should create a feeling of transparency on the ground floor of the building this contributes to a sense of safety and is welcoming to pedestrians the viewing zone of the first floor faade should be made up of approximately 75% transparent nonreflective glass window displays are encouraged but visibility into the building from the sidewalk should be maintained window with shutters with the exception of retail storefronts modestly scaled vertically proportioned windows articulated with muntins dividers of panes of glass are most appropriate to the local building vernacular shutters are also an enhancement entrances architectural detail should be incorporated into the groundfloor faade to create an easily identifiable and welcoming entrance as one of the most important parts of the facade the main entrance should be easily identifiable doors and entryways should follow a traditional storefront design usually recessed and should be compatible with the architectural style of the structure the entrances should also address the primary street or pedestrian pathway greek revival entrance when rear parking is provided the provision of secondary rear entrances and pleasing rear facades is strongly encouraged the design of the rear entrances and facades should be appropriately detailed to provide an attractive appearance but should not be overly embellished to compete with the main storefront victorian era entrance er building with attractive entrances and windows facing both major streets where a new building is to be located on a corner each side visible from a street should be considered a primary storefront faade and incorporate these fenestration patterns unless doing so would unduly obtrude into a primarily residential street materials and colors the town strongly prefers authentic natural materials such as wood brick and stone for the exterior of structures and landscape features construct windows storefronts and public doorways of wood where possible synthetic materials should be as close in appearance and detail to the natural material it simulates all sides of the building should use materials consistent with those on the front if visible from public streets or neighboring properties and should be carefully designed with similar detailing comparable quality and compatible materials awnings awnings that are functional for shade and shelter are encouraged these awnings should be made of canvas or a canvaslike material should fit the shape and scale of the window or door they are sheltering and should be designed to be compatible with and complimentary to building signage and design awnings should break at the vertical divisions of the structure ie the break between the display windows and the entrance the color and pattern of awnings affect the entire building and therefore should be carefully chosen a facade with minimal architectural detailing can be enhanced with bright colors and patterns while a more decorated facade may be complemented with a plain subtle shade the shape of awnings should be designed to fit the buildings architecture and relate to other awnings that exist along the street traditional retractable awning styles are encouraged other elements that add to new england heritage shade trees trees are an important element of landscape design the inclusion of shade trees in site design is encouraged shade trees provide an aesthetic value as well as a functional purpose to niantic village shade trees are large deciduous trees with spreading canopies with the most popular being oaks maples ashes elms and lindens in addition to aesthetic qualities and commercial appeal of these trees they also have more practical benefits such as reducing heating and cooling costs reducing heat reflected from paved areas converting carbon dioxide to oxygen helping prevent soil erosion increasing property value and much more therefore preservation and protection of old shade trees as well as planting new ones is strongly encouraged plantingslandscaping thoughtfully designed landscaping appropriate to the context of a small new england town should include the careful use of stone walls wood fencing paving materials and plantings these features can tie a structure to its landscape define spaces and make for a pleasant pedestrian experience preserve mature plantings stone walls and other historic features where possible and minimize modifications to the natural topography of the site lighting the exterior lighting scheme is important to the success of a storefront design lighting that highlights the sign and display area is often more effective than general lighting of the entire store when a larger building has a number of storefronts exterior lighting should be coordinated energy efficient lighting is also encouraged east lyme encourages energy conservation use of energy efficient bulbs and the elimination of extraneous light that can spill offsite or cause glare select pedestrianscaled light fixtures appropriate to building type and location avoid the use of floodlighting wall packs and tall light posts intended for lighting large areas signage in buildings with multiple storefronts a coordinated approach to signage throughout the building is particularly important use signs of similar size proportion and materials on each store varying the color of individual signs can add variety signage should be appropriately scaled to the building or surface onto which it is placed should not obscure important architectural features east lyme has comprehensive signage regulations see of the zoning regulations which provide further detailed requirements in addition to all other requirements of the zoning regulations the applicant for all buildings or structures and subject to these guidelines should submit scaled elevation drawings of the proposed structures for a design review the scale of such drawings should not be smaller than oneeighth inch equals one foot 18 10 the drawings should locate and identify exterior materials fixtures roof pitch and building or structure height and include dimensions and architectural characteristics pictured below are examples of types of architecture that are discouraged modification substantial changes to the proposal after approval should be reviewed by the commission if the application was a special permit or formal site plan approved by the commission minor changes that would not materially affect the applicants compliance with any of the criteria may be reviewed by the zoning official special criteria for exterior renovations and substantial improvement of existing buildings in addition to the above criteria exterior renovation or substantial improvement of a building or structure visible from a public street or from navigable waters should adhere to the following criteria the removal or alternation of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided unless the alteration is a positive improvement to the renovation the distinguishing original qualities or character of a building or structure its site and its environment should not be destroyed all buildings structures and sites should be recognized as products of their own time renovations should generally be compatible with the existing structure or buildings onsite but renovations that have no historical character and which seek to create an inappropriate appearance are discouraged changes which may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building structure its site and its environment these changes may have acquired significance in their own right and this significance shall be recognized and respected distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterizes a building structure or site should be treated with sensitivity deteriorated architectural features should be repaired or replaced to the extent possible in the event replacement is necessary the new material should match the material being replaced in composition design texture and other visual qualities when feasible repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of features substantiated by historic physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures renovations and additions which destroy significant historical architectural or cultural characteristics are discouraged designs should generally be compatible with the size scale material and character of the original structure whenever possible new additions or renovations to buildings and structures should be done in such a manner that if such additions or renovations were to be removed in the future the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired vocabulary  arcade a range of arches supported on piers or columns attached to or detached from the wall
