on the experiences of other counties and municipalities including but not limited to austin texas and garden grove california which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city of dallas georgia  and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by a law enforcement professional and an expert in economic development both of whom are familiar with

council of dallas georgia on other occasions including the public hearing and meeting of the mayor and city council of dallas georgia conducted on  and on documentary evidence and the study submitted to the mayor and city council of dallas georgia by scott halter chief of police of the city of dallas georgia takes note of the wellknown and self evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country it is the finding of the mayor and city council of dallas georgia that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions in the same manner establishments offering cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment have the same deleterious effects on the community among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol live commercial nudity in general and cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct prostitution public solicitation public indecency drug use and drug trafficking among the undesirable community conditions identified in other communities with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol commercial nudity in general and cinematographic or video graphic adult entertainment are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood increased allocation of and expenditure for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described the mayor and city council of dallas georgia finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city as well furthermore it is the finding of the mayor and city council of dallas georgia that other forms of adult entertainment including but not limited to adult book stores adult novelty shops adult video stores peep shows adult theaters and massage

establishments upon the city of dallas georgia are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells video tapes depicting sexual activities in addition the city of dallas has investigated gwinnett county georgias experience with the adult bookstore located within gwinnett county georgia which revealed that a substantial amount of activity at a bookstore located within that county involved booths which an individual could enter view videos depicting sexual activity and sexually interact with a bookstore patron in an adjoining booth hole strategically placed in the wall of adjoining booths the mayor and the city council of dallas georgia therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health welfare safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses neighborhoods and of churches schools residential areas public parks and childrens day care facilities to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments therefore the mayor and city council of dallas georgia finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment the mayor and city
