1752 purposes and findings a purposes this chapter is an updating of the borough curfew prescribing in accordance with prevailing community standards regulations for the conduct of minors on streets at night effectively enforced taught in the homes internalized and adhered to for generations all for the good of minors for the furtherance of family responsibility and for the public good safety and welfare b findings 1 the council finds that the curfew meets a very real local need has been over the years a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency and should be updated and amplified in light of hanovers local situation and facts including but not limited to the following a hanover is one of the oldest communities in and antedating york county with clearly defined boundaries along the intersection of state routes 94 194 and 116 in the hanover york valley in southwest york county hanover has a compact builtup area largely within an area of 45 square miles with its police department office in the center of the municipal area at 44 frederick street the police department office is located within the central business district which includes retail professional office utility office governmental service financial and manufacturing land uses still hanover remains primarily a residential community  a good place to raise children it is said  an area traditionally pennsylvania dutch in background where after  pm as people say the  1706 hanover code  1752   1753 definitions  word usage sidewalks are rolled up this communitys sense of the proper time for cessation of outdoor activities by minors on the streets is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this chapter which takes into consideration also the danger hours for nocturnal crime and for accumulations of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity 2 the council finds that compact hanover is not overcrowded population density as reflected in the borough comprehensive plan of 198 is 3891 per square mile the total area is 2370 acres of which streets occupy 453 acres 19%  164 acres are devoted to publicsemipublic uses 69%  715 acres are in residential use 301% where singlefamily dwellings occupy the largest portion of the residential area adequate indoor living space permits minors in hanover to healthfully occupy their time commercial recreation facilities are limited and there is little or nothing for minors to do outdoors after the curfew hours herein declared but to roam the streets 3 the council finds that there are 3336 minors the 1990 census figure for persons under 18 years of age residing in hanover there are fewer than 3078 minors for each school grade hanover has three elementary schools one middle school for grades five one high school 4 the council further finds that the hanover population 1990 census is 14399 there are 6316 households averaging 222 persons per household and 3930 heads of family households in 3197 81% households there are husbands and wives of the 2831 minors 2831 are classified in the 1990 census as own child of the head of household in which they reside hanover is a stable family community parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the norm legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had a demonstrated effectiveness over the years as parental control increases the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases and there is therefore continuing need for the nocturnal curfew for minors which has achieved and will continue to achieve under local conditions the purposes hereinbefore stated a for the purposes of this chapter the following terms phrases and words and their derivations shall have the meanings given herein when not inconsistent with the context words used in the present tense include the future words in the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include the plural the word shall is always mandatory and not merely directory  1752 general provisions  1753   1754 minors it shall be unlawful for any person 17 or less years of age under 18 to be or remain in or upon the streets within the borough of hanover at night during the period

groups or of interacting minors totaling four or more persons in which any minor involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home to implement that thought with additional precision and precaution numerous exceptions are expressly defined in  1753 more and more exceptions become available with increasing years and as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended by use of the meaningful phrase be or remain found constitutional in baker vs borough of steelton 17 dauphin 17 1912 street  a way or place of whatsoever nature open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel the term street includes the legal

the term street applies irrespective of what it is called or formally named whether alley avenue court road or otherwise b time of night referred to herein is based upon the prevailing standard of

and the police department c year of age continues from one birthday such as the 17th to but not including the day of the next such as the 18th birthday making it clear that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase under 18 years of age the latter phrase in practice unfortunately having confused a number of persons into the mistaken thought that eighteenyearolds might be involved similarly for example or less years of age means under 12 years of age a at  pm for minors 11 or less years of age  1753 hanover code  1754   1755 exceptions b at  pm for minors 12 or 13 years of age c at  pm for minors 14 or more years of age a in the following exceptional cases a minor on a borough street during the nocturnal hours for which  1754 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation and a clear general guide for minors their parents and their fellow citizens shall not however be considered in violation of this chapter 1 when accompanied by a parent of such minor 2 when accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to take said parents place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within specified areas 3 when exercising first amendment rights protected by the united states constitution such as the free exercise of religion freedom of speech and the right of assembly such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise by first delivering to municipal building police department personnel at the borough municipal building at 44 frederick street where and to whom high priority messages to the mayor are regularly received written communications signed by such minor and countersigned as practicable by a parent of such minor with their home address and telephone number addressed to the mayor of the borough specifying where and in what manner said minor will be on the streets at night during hours when this chapter is otherwise applicable to said minor in the exercise of a first amendment right specified in such communications 4 in the case of reasonable necessity but only after such minors parent has communicated to the borough police department personnel the facts establishing such reasonable necessity relating specified streets at a designated time for a described purpose including points of origin and destination a copy of such communication or of the police record thereof duly certified by the chief of police to be correct with an appropriate notation of the time it was received and of the names and address of such parent and minor shall be admissible evidence 5 when the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor resides or on the sidewalk of either nextdoor neighbor not communicating an objection to the police officer 6 when returning home by a direct route from and within 30 minutes of the termination of a school activity or an activity of religious or other voluntary association of which prior notice indicating the place and probable time of termination has been given in writing to and duly filed for immediate reference by the  1754 general provisions  1755  chief of police or the officer assigned by him on duty for the police department thus encouraging here as in other exceptional situations conduct on the part of minors involved in such activities and striking a fair balance for any somewhat conflicting interests 7 when authorized by special permit from the mayor carried on the person of the minor thus authorized as follows when necessary nighttime activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this chapter then recourse may be had to the mayor of the borough either for a regulation as provided in 8 or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant 8 when authorized by regulation issued by the mayor in other similar cases of reasonable necessity similarly handled but adapted to necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis normally such regulation by the mayor permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity media and agencies such as the schools and shall define the activity the scope of the use of the streets permitted the period of time involved not to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity and the reason for finding that such regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this chapter 9 when the minor carries a certified card of employment renewable each calendar month when the current facts so warrant dated or reissued not more than 45 days previously signed by the chief of police and briefly identifying the minor the address of his home and of his place of employment and his hours of employment 10 when the minor is with parental consent in a motor vehicle this contemplates normal travel from excess of caution this clearly exempts bona fide interstate movement

thereof may take appropriate action excepting designated minors minors in a defined group or area or all minors as the current facts may warrant 17 years of age at the date or attaining 17 years of age during the period that such formal rule is and remains in effect  1755 hanover code  1755   1756 parental responsibility it shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a minor knowingly to permit or by inefficient control to allow such minor to be or remain upon any borough street under circumstances not constituting an exception to or otherwise beyond the scope of this chapter the term knowingly includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parents legal custody  it is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental responsibility objective test it shall a priori be a defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such minor  1757 police procedures b each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations such as provisions for notification are severable as hereinafter provided but here reemphasized  and additional also severable exceptions broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled respectively in elementary middle school and high schools will be considered by the council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student associations school personnel citizens associations ward precinct and neighborhood spokesmen parents

in prima facie violation of this chapter normally shall take the minor to the borough police department office where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor whereupon they shall be interrogated this is intended to permit ascertainment under constitutional safeguards of relevant facts and to centralize responsibility in the sergeant there and then on duty for accurate effective fair impartial and uniform enforcement and recording thus making available experienced supervisory personnel the best of facilities and access to information and records in the absence of convincing evidence such as a birth certificate a policeman on the street shall in the first instance use his best judgment in determining age b police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide inter alia that the policemen may deliver to a parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances for example a minor of tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or are known c in any event such policeman shall within 24 hours file a written report with the chief of police or shall participate to the extent of the information for which he is responsible in the filing of such report within 24 hours  1755 general provisions  1757   1758 violations and penalties prevailing community standards and the real internalization thereof or interpersonal sanctions therefor that in practice count for much as to when minors should be off the streets reflected in this chapter are hereby undergirded with the following legal sanction d when a parent immediately called has come to take charge of the minor and the appropriate information has been recorded the minor shall be released to the custody of such parent if the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the minor then the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations approved in advance by juvenile authorities the minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent e in the case of a first violation by a minor the chief of police shall by certified mail send to a parent written notice of said violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this chapter including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties a if after the warning notice pursuant to  1757 of
