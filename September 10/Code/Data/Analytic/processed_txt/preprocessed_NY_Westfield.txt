assessment of the cost of public improvements by applicable law together with appropriate interest specifications for restoration of streets after excavation adopted 631968  13216 general the success of any street resurfacing is to a large extent dependent upon proper backfilling to obtain maximum loadbearing capacities and to prevent settlement it is necessary that the backfill be made of good material properly placed and completely compacted in backfilling around and over a structure the loads of heavy compacting equipment may exceed those for which the structure was designed therefore it is always advisable that the structure be covered adequately before direct loads are applied  13217 backfill material selected drainable backfill material is preferred but most local fill material can be used provided that it is carefully placed and compacted it should be free from large rocks and hard lumps or clods larger than three inches in diameter do not use frozen fill sod cinders or earth containing a high percentage of organic material granular material containing a small amount of silt or clay is ideal since it makes a dense stable fill in instances where the excavated material is unsuitable for backfill and the opening is soon to be repaved use sand for the backfill material  13218 backflow around structures fill material under haunches and around the structure should be placed alternately in sixinch layers on both sides of the pipe to permit thorough tamping the fill is placed alternately to keep it at the same elevation on both sides of the structure at all times the fine material should be tamped in these  village of westfield ny ecode360  93277 a b c a b c a b uniform layers with a small tamper under around and over the structure to a depth of two feet above the top it should proceed evenly on each side of the structure so that injurious side pressures cannot occur until two feet of fill has been placed earth must be dropped very carefully into the opening  13219 consolidation of backfill material the backfilled material shall be consolidated by tamping or with water compaction of fills by puddling or jetting of water is not recommended except for cohesionless sandy or sandygravel material the reason that water will not work satisfactorily in clayey soil is that it tends to produce a permanently unstable condition the fill should be placed in twelveinch layers across the opening and then tamped tamping can be done with hand or mechanical equipment depending on field conditions the tamping should proceed carefully and thoroughly to ensure a completely tamped backfill if the water method is used the first flooding should be applied only after the first two feet of fill above the structure has been placed and compacted by tamping and the second flooding during or after the subsequent filling of the opening the method is to attach a piece of pipe to the water hose and push it backfill until it touches the structure or previously flooded layers the water is then allowed to run until it reaches the surface an excess of water should be avoided to prevent disturbance of the earth under and around the structure and excess pressure upon it  13220 tamping equipment hand equipment for tamping under the haunches of a structure a pole or twobyfour is generally needed to work in the small areas hand tampers for compacting horizontal layers should weigh not less than 20 pounds and have a tamping face not larger than six inches by six inches ordinary sidewalk tampers are generally too light mechanical tampers most types of power tampers are satisfactory and can be used in all except the most confined areas however they must be used carefully and completely over the entire area of each layer to obtain the desired compaction avoid striking the structure with power tamping tools vibrating compactors vibrating equipment can be used to compact granular backfills but generally is unsatisfactory for clay or other plastic soils  13221 repaving after the opening has been properly backfilled repave the area to match the adjoining pavement surface if convenient provide temporary paving over the opening with crushed stone bonded with limestone screenings after six months or within one year place the permanent pavement if it is necessary or desirable to repave the area with a permanent surface immediately after backfilling use a onetofifteen cement mix in the top three to four feet of the excavation being careful to maintain one foot of fine material above the pipe penalties for offenses adopted

modify the strict letter of this chapter where a literal interpretation would cause unnecessary hardship in the case of a use variance or where the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted would outweigh the detriment to the health safety and welfare of the neighborhood in the case of an area variance amended 822010 by ll no 42010 applicability and limitations the zoning board of appeals can decide appeals from a person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the enforcement officer the zoning board of appeals may reverse affirm or modify the decision made by the municipal board the zoning board of appeals has absolutely no power to amend this chapter and must exercise great care to ensure that its rulings do not in effect amend this chapter basis for granting area variances amended 822010 by ll no 42010 area variances provide relief of a dimensional nature eg lot shape or grade and must be based on an analysis of whether the benefit to the applicant would outweigh the detriments to the health safety and welfare of the neighborhood the burden of proof is on the applicant and if relief is warranted it should be the minimum necessary in making its determination the zoning board of appeals shall take into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted as weighed against the detriment to the health safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant in making such determination the board shall consider whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting of the area variance  the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue other than an area variance  the requested area variance is substantial  the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood or district  and the alleged difficulty was selfcreated which consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the zoning board of appeals but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the area variance basis for granting use variances use variances provide relief to an applicant who is denied of this chapter by the municipal board the right to use land or structures in a certain manner since the use is not listed as an allowable use in this chapter in order to be granted the use variance the applicant must prove that unnecessary hardship exists and this is accomplished by showing all of the following the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return if used only for a purpose allowed in the district this does not mean that profits will necessarily be maximized the use requested by the variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and be detrimental to properties in the vicinity  village of westfield ny ecode360  258277 c 2 e f 1 a b c 2 a b c d e f g h i 3 g the plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances and not to the general conditions in the neighborhood in the case of a use variance if the hardship is selfimposed then the variance should generally speaking be denied

be necessary or desirable and are in compliance with the intent of this chapter the decisions must be written in the form of a resolution and must state in detail the reasons for granting or denying
