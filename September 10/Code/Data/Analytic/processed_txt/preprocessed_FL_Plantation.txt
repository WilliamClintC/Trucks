fs  2d 2013 exempts from floridas licensing requirements for the professional practice of engineering d regular fulltime employees of a public utility or other entity subject to regulation by the florida public service commission federal energy regulatory commission or federal communications commission representatives of the communications industry have advocated that this exemption and other statutory provisions concerning the practice of engineering to wit fs   2 2013 would allow submissions for city review described in that portion of paragraph 9 clause i which does not relate to structural capacity and paragraph 9 clauses ii iv vi and vii collectively the clauses to be made by persons who are not licensed to practice engineering in this state  furthermore the industry has requested that paragraph 9 be modified to not require an engineer licensed in this state to make such submissions to plantation the industrys argument if true would allow any employee of entities benefitting from the exemption regardless of how trained or educated to make the submissions described in the clauses when such entities seek approvals from plantation as of the  legal research has disclosed no binding florida appellate case law or opinion of the attorney general that construes this exemption so as to include instances where an entity benefitting by the exemption makes external submissions of the type described above to a florida local government for approval of a communications facility as distinguished from the preparation of plans inspections projections and performance of scientific analyses and other engineeringlike practices for such entities internal use and benefit further the city has been advised by counsel to the florida board of professional engineers that such board has not formally addressed this topic as of  being ever mindful of the florida legislatures expressed strong public interests in health and safety as set forth in fs   2013 regarding the need for state regulation of the practice of engineering the city does not wish to accept the industry position in the absence of appropriate legal authority however if as and when binding case law is established or an opinion of the attorney general of florida is rendered or the florida board of professional engineers issues a declaratory statement in a proceeding in which the city was noticed as of the date the petition was filed to the effect that florida law regulating the professional practice of engineering does not require the submissions to the city concerning the clauses described above to be from an engineer licensed in this state then the city will require such submissions to be signed by an individual who has graduated from an accredited college or university with at least a bachelors degree in engineering science and who certifies that he or she has at least three 3 years of experience with radio frequency and wireless communications facilities the provisions of this footnote are intended to allow the industry to exhaust administrative remedies or obtain requisite legal authority concerning this topic from the branches of florida government principally authorized

stormwater management utility findings and purpose of utility a findings  the city of plantation finds and determines that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the health safety and welfare of the public further plantation finds as follows 1 stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into receiving water bodies thereby degrading water quality  2 the increase in nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen resulting from stormwater runoff accelerates eutrophication of receiving water bodies and adversely affects flora and fauna  3 improperly channeling water runoff increases the velocity of stormwater runoff and increases erosion and sedimentation  4 construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion  5 siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion and congestion of water bodies with natural or nonnatural debris or invasive aquatic weeds decreases the capacity of water bodies to hold and transport water interferes with navigation interferes with flood prevention and control and harms indigenous flora and fauna  6 impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge  7 improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidence and intensity of flooding which endangers property and human welfare  8 substantial economic losses may result from adverse impacts of uncontrolled stormwater runoff into the waters of the plantation ecosystem  9 plantation has an existing stormwater management program it administers various stormwater management functions and maintains a stormwater management system  10 the existing stormwater management system in plantation requires regular maintenance and improvement  11 due to the age of plantations existing stormwater management system and its necessary rehabilitation maintenance replacement and improvement and due to the implementation of new stormwater management system enhancements that are required to meet other governmental mandates a funding mechanism for the citys stormwater management program is required  12 all developed property in plantation except for property located within the plantation acres improvement district paid either uses or benefits from the citys stormwater management program  13 the extent of use of the stormwater management system by each property depends upon a variety of factors such as land utilization and the amount of impervious surface on the property which influences runoff  14 the costs of the citys stormwater management program should be allocated and assessed to the extent practicable to customers based in significant part on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of their property on the stormwater management system it is fair reasonable just and right to apportion allocate and assess the costs of the citys stormwater management program to the extent practicable and charge a fee therefor to each property based in significant part on the impact of runoff from the impervious areas of such property upon the stormwater management system in view of the above the city has determined to levy and assess developed property with a stormwater management utility fee using the nonad valorem assessment procedure based upon a calculated eru rate as further explained in this   15 the operation of the citys stormwater management program requires adequate revenues and it is in the interest of the public to finance stormwater management adequately and with a reasonable and equitable assessed usebased fee so each customer using or benefitting by the program pays based upon the extent to which such customer contributes to the need for the stormwater management program while the fee is not a special assessment this methodology will ensure that the benefits of the stormwater management utility to each assessed property will exceed the assessed fee to each property  16 the city finds and determines that there are particular and special benefits to real property conferred by creating and maintaining a formally established municipal stormwater management utility as explained in this section  furthermore the city finds and determines that by utilizing the levy and assessment methodology for the fee that is described in this article vii the total amount to be paid by nonad valorem assessments for the citys stormwater management utility for each assessed property should not and will not be more than the particular and special benefits to be derived by each property benefited thereby  and 17 by utilizing the uniform method for the levy collection and enforcement of nonad valorem assessments procedure for collecting the stormwater management utility fee the failure to pay the assessment for a property will cause a tax certificate to be issued against the property which may result in a loss of title b purpose of article the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the immediate and longterm health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city to protect real property and all improvements thereon and to protect the value of the citys ad valorem tax base in order to effectuate these purposes this article has the following objectives 1 to formally establish and approve a municipal stormwater management utility whose program is mutually coordinated with those developed by the united states the state of florida the south florida water management district broward county the plantation acres improvement district paid the old plantation water control district opwcd and by other governmental units and agencies  2 to develop enhance maintain and improve a stormwater management system  3 to adopt stormwater management utility fees sufficient to fund the citys stormwater management program  4 to encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between humanity and nature  5 to protect restore and maintain the chemical physical functional and biological integrity of community waters  6 to prevent individuals and business entities from causing harm to the community by engaging in unregulated activities which adversely affect water resources  7 to encourage the construction of drainage systems which aesthetically and functionally approximate the utility of natural systems  8 to encourage the protection of natural and manmade beneficial systems and the use of those systems in ways not impairing their beneficial functioning  9 to encourage the use of approved drainage systems which consume minimal electrical energy and petroleum fuels when operating  10 to minimize the transport of pollutants to community waters  11 to maintain or restore or recharge groundwater levels  12 to minimize erosion and sedimentation  13 to help prevent damage from flooding while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial  and 14 to help reduce flood insurance premium rates which might otherwise increase in the absence of an adequate effective and coordinated municipal stormwater management program  3282012   2 9122013 definitions for utility base rate means the total cost to the city of the citys stormwater management program bonds means revenue bonds notes loans or any other debt

on public roads a prohibition of roadway canvassers and solicitors 1 findings  purpose  intent a the city council desires to adopt an ordinance prohibiting roadway canvassers and solicitors from soliciting and canvassing on specified roadways located in the city because such roadway canvassers and solicitors pose a danger to themselves and the public at large by interfering with the safe movement and free flow of traffic in these heavily traveled roadways  b according to the florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles 2007 florida traffic crash statistics report five hundred thirty 530 pedestrians were killed on florida roadways in 2007  sixtyfive 65 of those pedestrians were killed on roadways in broward county  and c according to the florida department of highway safety and motor vehicles traffic crash statistics reports broward county had the second highest number of pedestrian fatalities and injuries in the state of florida for the period 20072011  and d numerous types of roadway canvassers and solicitors exist within the city including but not limited to children adolescents and adults who seek to collect money for schools and community activities  vendors who sell flowers newspapers and various other wares and people who seek donations or distribute written information  and e roadway canvassers and solicitors approach motorists and passengers in motor vehicles engaged in travel on roads and are particularly susceptible and vulnerable to serious injury or death due to the speed carelessness aggressiveness andor the mere number of motorists who operate vehicles on busy roads within the city  and f the main function of a roadway is transportation roadway design does not account for accommodating roadway canvassers and solicitors  and g according to a local newspaper article published in 200 twentynine 29 roadway canvasserssolicitors have been seriously injured and at least fourteen 14 more have been killed by motor vehicles during a fifteenyear period  many of those deaths occurred while the canvassersolicitor was sitting or standing in a median or on the side of the street including a newspaper vendor who was struck by a car while carrying papers on us 1 and broward boulevard in fort lauderdale on   a newspaper vendor who was standing on the median at federal highway and stirling road on   and a miami herald newspaper vendor who was selling papers on the side of the street at stirling road and us 441 on   h just as recently as  a solicitor who was standing on the median at sunrise boulevard and university drive in our city was struck and seriously injured by a careless driver  and i the presence of roadway canvassers and solicitors in and around our roadways interfere with the safe movement of vehicular traffic  and j a portion of the city roadway network currently operates below acceptable operating level of service los standards adopted by the florida department of transportation for automobiles during peak hours indicating a high volume of traffic  k the city councils intention and desire is to use the least restrictive means possible to advance the significant governmental interests of traffic safety and public safety to accomplish this goal city staff members analyzed the myriad roadways paved for vehicular traffic within the city and determined that the these enumerated roadways listed in subsection b below present an increased and significant danger for use by distracted drivers pedestrians and roadway canvassers and solicitors and pose the greatest threat to traffic and public safety in reference to activities and use by roadway canvassers and solicitors therefore the city council has determined that such activities and use by roadway solicitors and canvassers shall be prohibited on the roads listed below in subsection b  and l it is the finding of the city council based on the citys staff analysis that many other alternative channels of

justifies utilizing the flexibility  b whether the project as proposed offers significant benefits not otherwise available to the city if the citys land development regulations were otherwise followed

taking advantage of natural and manmade conditions or environments controlling pedestrian and vehicular traffic systems substantially intensifying landscape or providing landscape contributions to the city improving or maintaining public infrastructure or giving the city a contribution in aide of infrastructure improvements or maintenance exceeding setbacks and building separations and reflecting an orderly and creative arrangement of buildings and land uses as appropriate  c the extent to which the project contributes to the tax base adds employment and provides other positive economic impacts  d the extent to which the project impacts public services eg fire ems school police water wastewater and other services and generates negative secondary effects of odors fumes noise traffic or crime  e the extent to which the property has potential to be developed in a desirable manner under its present land use and zoning scheme without the application of flexibility and whether such foreseeable development is or is not more beneficial to the community  f the nature and types of uses surrounding the subject property and whether the development proposal is compatible and complements those uses  g specific goals objectives or policies of the city comprehensive plan and other city plans that are consistent or inconsistent with the development proposed  h the extent to

from the effective date of the ordinance approving the utilization of lac residential units for such changed development b policy considerations applicable to utilizing the lac residential units the following are the guiding policy considerations that the city will evaluate in its legislative review when deciding whether to enact an ordinance that allocates or utilizes any portion of the lac residential unit allowance for a particular parcel of property 1 whether there is a change in population socioeconomic factors or physical development of property near or affecting the subject property which change was unforeseen or unanticipated and which change has created a present problem or opportunity that justifies utilizing any portion of the lac residential unit allowance  2 whether the project as proposed offers significant benefits not otherwise available to the city for example does the planning design and development of the property exceed the minimum otherwise required land development requirements in terms of reserving appropriate open space development themes taking advantage of natural and manmade conditions or environments controlling pedestrian and vehicular traffic systems substantially intensifying landscape or providing landscape contributions to the city and improving or maintaining public infrastructure or giving the city a contribution in aide of infrastructure improvements or maintenance does the planning design and development of the property exceed setbacks and building separations is the planning design and development of the property compatible with the size and scale building height mass and elevations of existing or planned surrounding and nearby buildings and structures does the planning design and development of the property meet many or all of the aspirational principles that govern site design considerations and reflect an orderly and creative arrangement of buildings and land uses as appropriate  3 the extent to which the project contributes to the tax base adds employment and provides other positive economic impacts  4 the extent to which the project impacts public services eg fire ems school police water wastewater stormwater and other services and generates negative secondary effects of odors fumes noise traffic or crime  5 the extent to which the property has potential to be developed in a desirable manner under its present land use and zoning scheme without the application of lac residential unit allowance and whether such foreseeable development is or is not more beneficial to the community  6 the nature and types of uses surrounding the subject property and whether the development proposal is compatible and complements those uses  7 the extent to which the proposed development is consistent with specific goals objectives or policies of the city comprehensive plan including specifically the goals objectives and policies of the local activity center future land use designation as well as if applicable the plan of redevelopment of the plantation community redevelopment agency or the plantation midtown plan  8 the extent to which lac residential units will remain available for future use by the city under this sections requirements and under any possible regulatory scheme  9 the extent to which the utilization of lac residential units serves or does not serve the publics health safety or welfare  10 the future land use and needs of the community  and 11 such other policy considerations that may not be set forth above but which are nonetheless considered by the city governing body to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  6222011 secs 19721979  reserved article iv  impact fees authority and applicability a the city has the authority to adopt

that development in the city requires additional governmental services and capital facilities b it is the policy of the city council that new development should pay a pro rata share of capital costs related to the additional governmental services and facilities required to accommodate new development c the city council after consideration of the impact fee study hereby finds that impact fees provide a reasonable method of ensuring that development will pay only a determined pro rata share of capital costs of capital facilities necessary to accommodate that development d providing an adequate level of facilities and services within the city is essential to and in the best interests of the public health safety and welfare of the city e under the provisions of this article development shall be required to pay a reasonable pro rata share of the capital costs related to the facilities made necessary by such development development that pays impact fees is not responsible for the public facility needs of existing development and impact fees will not be used to cure existing deficiencies resulting from existing development f as more clearly set forth within the impact fee study for the city of plantation florida prepared by duncan associates in february 201 the city has assumed that new development will require an investment in new or expanded capital facilities which is similar to the current relationship between the citys existing levels of capital investment for the type of facility for which the impact fees enacted in this article are to be collected and the citys existing service units a service unit being a standardized measure of demand for the type of facility for which the impact fees enacted in this article are to be collected this relationship ie the citys existing levels of determined capital investment for each type of facility for which the impact fees enacted in this article divided by the calculated existing service units associated therewith results in a determined existing level of service for each type of facility g the city has independently prepared forecasts of estimated capital costs for capital facilities which the citys department heads have determined are reasonably necessary to support future development and such estimated costs are greater than the revenue projected to be generated by the various impact fees authorized and created herein  consequently the city reasonably believes that the impact fees authorized and created herein do not exceed the reasonably foreseeable capital costs of the capital facilities which shall be necessary to serve future development h much of plantation was developed after the enactment of the local government comprehensive planning act of 197 and a significant portion of plantation was developed in accordance with a development of regional impact order obtained by gulfstream land and development corporation  therefore plantation is largely a planned municipality the boundary of the city of plantation and arterial and collector rightofway network is such that no portion of the city is materially geographically separated from the whole and the citys citizens can easily access any area of the citys facilities that are open to the public as an example city hall and the city police station and the city development services building are centrally located in a campus environment and the citys park and recreation facilities are planned and located in a way to be used by all residents the citys fire stations are located throughout the city so that fire suppression activities can be coordinated and networked to achieve suppression efficiencies because of the dimension of the citys boundary the arterial and collector road network within plantation and the location of the citys public facilities and the planned nature of plantation the city has determined that it is reasonable and appropriate for impact fees collected from a development located within plantation to be spent on public improvements anywhere within plantation  7242013 imposition and enforcement a the applicant shall pay impact fees required by section 1985 prior to the issuance of the relevant building permit or prior to the change of use necessitating the impact fee payment whichever first occurs this subsection a shall be applicable to all applicants

thereby incurs may be added to the impact fee amount payable the recovery of these costs shall not be considered as part of the impact fee otherwise payable and the revenues associated with recovering the citys actual costs may be deposited into the citys general fund and shall not be required to be deposited into the trust fund e the city administrator shall determine the classification of land use type in order to apply the correct impact fee in accordance with the applicable impact fee schedule the following guidelines shall be considered in making such determination 1 the city administrator shall be guided by the definitions of the land use categories in section 1982 if the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied is not specified on the fee schedule the city administrator shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land development on the fee schedule 2 in general impact fees shall be assessed based on the principal use of a building or lot for example a warehouse that contains an administrative office would be assessed at the warehouse rate for all of the square footage shopping centers shall be assessed at the retailcommercial rate regardless of the type of tenants for a true mixeduse development such as one that includes both residential and nonresidential development the fee shall be determined by adding up the fees that would be payable for each use as if it was a freestanding land use type pursuant to the fee schedule f should the city accept a land dedication or offered contributions in aid of construction to meet required levels of service for a development project that would be required to pay impact fees the city shall reduce the amount of impact fees owed for a development projects impact by the value of land dedicated or improvements offered to meet required levels of service for the development project as determined by the city administrator the city administrator may develop administrative policies that guide the decisions made under this subsection f  7242013 review and revision a the city shall update the impact fee study at least once every five 5 years and the city shall revise this article as necessary b between periodic updates of the impact fee study the city administrator shall revise the fee schedules annually to adjust for inflation each september following the first full year since the effective date of the impact fees based on a periodic update of the impact fee study and each september thereafter until the study is next updated the city administrator shall determine an annual inflation adjustment factor which shall be the ratio of the engineering newrecord construction cost index for the most recent available month to the same index twelve 12 months prior the current fees will be multiplied by this inflation factor to determine the revised fees which shall go into effect the following november 15 in the event that the engineering newsrecord construction cost index is discontinued a similar index shall be used  7242013 trust account and use of funds a all impact fee funds shall be used solely for capacityexpanding capital improvements of the type for which they were collected impact fee funds shall not be used for operations or maintenance or for replacement of existing buildings or equipment b impact fee funds collected by the city shall be placed in an interest bearing accounts until such time as the expenditures authorized by this article will take place interest proceeds from these funds will accrue to the account each type of impact fee shall have its own account c impact fee funds shall be expended by the city within ten 10 years from the date of collection  7242013 refund of impact fees paid a if a building permit expires and if no construction has been commenced then the applicant or its successors may request within three 3 months of permit expiration a refund of the impact fee paid as a condition for its issuance without payment of interest and less any administrative charges herein provided b any impact fee funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten 10 years from the date the impact fee payment was collected shall be returned to the current property owner with interest earned and less any administrative

chapter of the ordinances resulted from a comprehensive evaluation and update of the citys sign code which prior to this revision had remained substantially intact for over a decade several workshops were held both at a city council meeting level and at an industry group level to obtain input and advice for this new chapters formulation the city has examined many of the special exceptions which have been periodically granted in order to develop a sign code that reduces an apparent need for consistent administrative relief notably the city previously enacted emergency nonemergency respectively and promulgated a series of resolutions city resolution nos 861 872 879 892 and 8993 which clarified the prior granted special exceptions with respect to certain signage the principles embodied within such ordinances and resolutions are reflected in this new law in enacting this comprehensive revision the city has weighed and balanced various competing interests with two 2 enactment goals in mind firstly the new legislation will avoid the need to further amend the citys sign law for a very long time hopefully at least another decade except when necessary to comply with evolving case law or court orders and secondly the new legislation will reduce dramatically the number of applications for site specific administrative relief the city elected officers wish to thank the public the chamber of commerce the members of the planning and zoning board the city planning zoning and economic development department other city staff and specifically commenting developers and property owners for their contributions to this comprehensive legislative effort  10132004   12142005 severability and conflict a throughout the nation local sign codes continue to be subjected to vigorous litigation formulating a sign code that is enforceable in every respect is a daunting and difficult task the citys legislative objective is to enact a sign code which is severable to the greatest extent possible the primary objective of the city is to regulate the number size height location and aesthetic appearance of signs such that these noncontent based regulations can survive and stand alone if other portions of the determined invalid b to further the interest of severability the been made divisible in many respects permanent sign regulations temporary sign regulations and transitory sign regulations have been separated such that if any regulations concerning one 1 sign type are found invalid this determination will not affect regulations concerning other sign types additionally sign regulations concerning residential and nonresidential land uses have been separated so that in the event regulations concerning one 1 type of land use are determined invalid regulations concerning other types of land uses may survive furthermore sign regulations concerning certain types of nonresidential and residential developments have been presented in matrix form so that if matrix regulations concerning one 1 type of development are found invalid matrix regulations concerning other types of developments may survive finally the city has created elective sections to some of the projectspecific regulations in its sign matrices for certain land uses that might accept some content restrictions and thus elect to be governed by the elective sections as opposed to being governed by the applicable regulations in the matrix  however if any of the elective sections are determined invalid the city intends that the matrix regulations will remain and survive c except as otherwise provided in sections 2220cc 2231 2232 2233 2235 2236 2237 2238 2242 2244 and 2264 should any article division section subsection paragraph sentence clause phrase or other part of this

fac a for the purposes of this section 1 bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility 2 severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production b a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs c and d of this subsection c 1 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the director of utilities at least ten 10 days before the date of the bypass if possible 2 a user shall submit oral notice to the director of utilities of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written notice shall also be provided within five 5 days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written description shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the director of utilities may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within twentyfour 24 hours d 1 bypass is prohibited and the director of utilities may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless i bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  ii there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and

wastewater capacity charges for all other users including but not limited to commercial users industrial multiplefamily residential users etc shall be collected prior to the issuance of a building permit for such nonsinglefamily residential developments predicated upon the requested development permits sought by such nonsinglefamily users who shall pay capacity charges attributable to the added burden which such new expansion or addition places upon the systems 2 the unit amount of the capacity charge shall be determined on the recommendation of the citys utility systems consulting engineers by the city council process of public meetings on a regular review basis not later than september 15 of each oddnumbered year or more frequently in the discretion of the city council in order to ensure that such water and wastewater capacity charges continue to be reasonably commensurate with the burden currently imposed or reasonably anticipated to be imposed on such systems by such new users 3 the capacity charge is comprised of two 2 separate services  ie water and wastewater in areas where only one 1 of these services is available the applicable charge shall be that of the service provided the applicable charge for the other service will become due when such other service is made available 4 there is hereby imposed a capacity charge based on an equitable apportionment of the cost of financing additions to the citys water and wastewater systems attributable to increasing the capacity to serve of such systems upon the most recently available information the rates fees and charges are set forth in schedule 1 which is included and made a part hereof and attached hereto as appendix 1 a for other users these accounts will for the purpose of establishing a capacity charge

notwithstanding the foregoing meter sizeequivalent residential unit schedule where the state or county health department attributes a higher water usage on certain commercial accounts in their printed codes criteria regulations statutes or ordinances then such higher water use shall be used in calculating the capacity charges of such nonresidential users unless the city demonstrates a higher or the prospective customer demonstrates a lower volume of use based on actual flow data over a sufficient period of time to create in the opinion of the citys consulting engineers meaningful actual flow figures in which event such actual flow figures shall be deemed the best guide to the actual impact of such new nonresidential customer upon the citys systems and thus shall be the basis of

to assist to developers or owners of subdivisions or areas within the said city to ascertain such policy 1 onsite ciac when an owner or developer of a subdivision or area shall install within the subdivision or area water distribution and sewer collection facilities and shall further convey or assign the same to the city at no cost to the city following their completion and satisfactory inspection by the city engineer the city shall accept the same as onsite ciac and shall thereafter maintain the onsite contributions at no further cost or expense to the owner or developer of the subdivision or area the onsite collection and distribution system shall be reflected on plans sealed by a florida registered engineer submitted to the utility department and same shall be reviewed and approved by the utility department prior to the issuance of building permits for such subdivision or area the appropriate engineering inspection fees shall be paid prior to issuing of the building permits 2 offsite ciac sized to meet the needs of property being developed whenever it is necessary for the owner or developer of a subdivision or area to extend or enlarge the offsite water distributiontransmission main of the citys utility system and to enlarge or extend the sewer collectionforce main facility from the subdivision or area in order to obtain such utility services for the subdivision or area under all then prevailing ordinances or resolutions pertaining to such utility services the sizing of such offsite water distributiontransmission main and sewer collectionforce main facilities to adequately service the subdivision or area then seeking development shall be determined by the utility department on the advice of its consulting engineers once the owner or developer of such subdivision or area installs such offsite water distribution transmission main and sewer collection force main facility to obtain such utility services from the citys utility department and conveys or assigns same to the city following their completion and satisfactory inspection by the city engineer at no cost to the city of plantation the city shall accept same as offsite ciac and shall thereafter maintain the offsite contribution at no further cost or expense to the owner or developer of the subdivision or area then being served the offsite ciac shall be reflected on plans sealed by a florida registered engineer submitted to the utility department and same shall be reviewed and approved by the utility department prior to the issuance of building permits for such subdivision or area the appropriate engineering and inspection fees shall be paid prior to issuance of any building permits 3 offsite ciac reimbursement policy a excluding zones 1 2 and 3 for water transmission and distribution facilities as defined in paragraph c 1 whenever any offsite water distribution and transmission main andor sewer collectionforce main facilities are deemed necessary and useful to meet anticipated needs of future customers within the city by the utility department on the advice of its consulting utilities engineers and either an owner or developer of land within the city the city or any other governmental agency including duly authorized drainage districts the county school board or the county herein the contributor agrees to install such facilities and same would benefit other subdivisions or areas not then enjoying utility services of the citys utility department then such contributor who undertakes to voluntarily install such facilities shall be deemed to be entitled to a reimbursement on a pro rata basis from the property or area which benefits from the installation of such facilities 2 the amount of reimbursement collected shall be determined under the following formula and procedure i the consulting utilities engineer shall in a written report filed with the utility department indicate the other properties benefited from such contributed facilities ascertain and determine the then value and extent of the contributed benefits and determine the fair and reasonable pro rata amount of reimbursement from such other subdivisions or areas which reimbursement will be collected as offsite ciac cash payments by the utility department ii once the consulting utilities engineers written report is filed with the utility department no parcel within the area of benefit shall receive development approval which would contemplate accessing into or benefitting from the contributed facilities unless the proper reimbursement amount determined by the consulting utilities engineer is paid to the citys utility department iii in determining the actual amount of such offsite ciacs the consulting utilities engineer shall adjust the initial breakdown of the cost of the facilities being contributed which breakdown the contributor shall file with the utility department once such facilities are installed and inspected and conveyed to the citys utility department by the contributor thereof using as a base the latest published index of the quarterly construction index published in engineering news record magazine entitled twenty cities construction cost record magazine or such other reliable engineering cost index specified in the consulting utilities engineers written report preceding the acceptance of such facilities by the city after installation with the adjustment on such base index to be made by the latest published index of such engineering cost index preceding the application for development approvals and building permits by the subdivision or area seeking to connect into and benefit from such previously contributed facilities  provided however that at no time shall such calculation cause a reimbursement or refund below that incurred by the contributor of such facilities when same were initially installed the intent here being that when a property benefits from previously installed utility facilities and pays for such benefits as an offsite ciac such payment should equal the then cost of construction but no less than the actual cost of construction for such facilities previously contributed and installed 3 the following sums shall be includable in calculating the contributors costs for which reimbursement shall be made the utility facilities design costs construction costs construction supervision costs inspection and testing costs and all costs incurred by the contributor citys cost recovery program in utilizing this offsite utility facilities

specifications advertising for and evaluating bids preparing and awarding construction contracts reviewing plans and construction progress conducting inspections and testings and all costs incurred in obtaining the consulting utilities engineers written report for this reimbursement policy and shall be able to include such fee consultant expenses outofpocket costs and staff time expenses in terms of such staffs applicable hourly rate as defined in section 2764d of this  as part of the total contributed costs of the facilities from which reimbursement will be made b for zones 1 2 and 3 1 for zones 1 2 and 3 as identified below the method for determining the pro rata reimbursement to be collected for water transmission andor distribution facilities will be based on a charge per eru from each utility customer for mains in each zone identified within the 1985 master plan plus the pro rata costsharing for extensions from those mains the cost of such extensions calculated by the consulting utilities engineer in a manner similar to paragraph a above the charge per eru is based on an estimate of the cost of the mains identified in the master plan within each zone divided by the estimate of the total erus to be developed within the aforementioned described benefitted zone 2 reimbursements to contributing developers for zones 1 2 and 3 water transmission andor distribution facilities will be made on a first installed first paid basis 3 the zones and charges are set forth as follows zone 1 the boundaries for zone 1 are on the north by northwest 21st court  on the east by hiatus road  on the west by flamingo road and on the south by southwest 3rd street zone 1 excludes the areas serviced by water as of date is passed the charge per eru for zone 1 will be eightynine

of this article vii to establish rates and charges for water and wastewater service that are uniform throughout the city and which promote conservation the city finds and determines that the conservation of water and wastewater is in the publics interest in that fresh water is a relatively scarce resource and the reduction of wastewater serves the public interest of promoting the environment additionally the cost expenses and permitting of raw water production treatment and disposal is increasing and the conservation of water and wastewater will help to reduce these costs the south florida water management district determines and imposes water use restrictions according to defined water shortage phases these phases define restrictions as being moderate severe extreme and critical within the last year land within the city was subject to south florida water management district water shortage phase restrictions in view of the above water and wastewater service rates and charges are designed such that as the capacity to consume water and wastewater as well as the actual consumption of water and wastewater increases the marginal fee and charge therefor also increases additionally when the south florida water management district determines and imposes water shortage phase use restrictions the citys rate structure will likewise impose a flat surcharge on the citys water and wastewater rates so as to more aggressively encourage conservation efforts this flat surcharge will increase depending upon the severity of the declared water shortage phase  6192002 partial

midtown district intent the spi3 plantation midtown herein also referred to as this  will provide development standards for plantation midtown to promote an orderly transformation of the district from a predominantly suburban development pattern to a denser and more active mixeduse activity center characteristic of traditional town center environments to that end this based on the following general principles a land uses should be more tightly integrated within an urbanized mixeduse development pattern b classification of various development types within the district is based on classifying the fronting streets rather than the blocks themselves c development should emphasize pedestrianfriendly streetscapes with smaller subdivided blocks and an expanded more interconnected street network d building forms and massing should address the fronting streets directly with minimal setbacks and active occupied frontages that support enhanced pedestrian activity e the design of the streets parking areas and the public realm should reinforce principles of safe neighborhood design and promote the objectives of crime prevention design f parking should be deemphasized by locating it at the interior of blocks and by several strategies designed to reduce the overall quantity of parking required g the architecture should reinforce the pedestrian experience and respond to the human scale by such devices as facade modulation differentiation of the base zone and provision of such elements as display windows balconies arcades awnings etc h landscaping should concentrate on enhancing the streetscape experience and shading the pedestrian with larger consolidation of green space into usable parks and plaza areas i signage and graphics should be more active and prominent in selective areas where a more vital commercial environment is desired j incentives are included to promote the advancement of the principles listed above  5122004 general provisions a district this to plantation

master list of business and commercial uses no building or land shall be used and no building shall be erected constructed reconstructed or structurally altered which is designed arranged or intended to be occupied or used for any other purpose unless permitted by the provisions of article x of this chapter c additional permitted uses certain uses are not currently included in the master list of business uses of the plantation but are permitted in the district 1 houses of worship and other related facilities such as sunday school rectory parish house etc provided that the facilities are housed in a dedicated building or campus on land owned by the same institution 2 police and public safety facilities 3 drivenot associated with a foodservice establishment are permitted as a conditional use  5122004   4192006 streets a intent this the streets in plantation midtown according to their suitability for humanscaled pedestrianfriendly street life the primary focus of this to promote development that reinforces the character of various streets according to the role they play in the urban whole the type of development that occurs on any given street is determined by the street classification  this also encourages the development of both sides of the street in a consistent manner a central goal of the master plan is to establish a better more coherent internal street network within the district many of the streets proposed in the ultimate projection of the master plan are either not existent to day or are realigned from their present location incentives are included in this encourage the creation of more pedestrianfriendly streets and to break up larger redevelopment tracts into smaller blocks b street classification all streets excluding undesignated streets are classified according as a b c or d streets the classification of all designated existing streets in plantation midtown is indicated in figure 27623 b figure 27623 street classification map c general characteristics this development provisions intended to reinforce the qualities described below for each street type the rightofway width and particular street section may vary depending on available space and other existing constraints 1 a streets a streets are characterized by minimal setbacks active commercial frontage at the ground floor taller and more intensive buildings fronting the street and a consistent streetwall a streets typically feature a number of traffic calming measures as well as a full complement of pedestrian amenities including wide sidewalks onstreet parking and welldeveloped streetscape a streets are the principal town center streets and are intended to be well used by pedestrians slow moving traffic and will be the primary transit routes 2 b streets b streets are similar to a streets although less intensively developed but still urban in terms of pedestrian traffic characterized by a small setback and a relatively consistent streetwall b streets are more residential in nature but might also have smaller scale commercial uses 3 c streets c streets are the large regional arterials bounding the district as well as broward boulevard and peters road they are intended primarily for efficient vehicular movement they are characterized by large setbacks with landscape buffers although they should also be able to accommodate access points with enhanced signage and gateway elements 4 d streets d streets are more suburban in nature characterized by larger setbacks and less building frontage d streets are located in quieter areas but are also used as the back streets for the town center areas where elements such as surface parking loading docks etc are located d design standards the following design standards apply to all streets within the district they shall be used for any repaving realignment or other modifications as well as for any new street segments constructed as part of a development or redevelopment project these standards are not meant to be exhaustive  rather they are intended to establish minimum requirements to achieve an overall design consistency dimensions are measured to the face of curb or to the centerline of lane as appropriate 1 roadways i posted speed for any street other than the existing c streets shall be a maximum of thirty 30 miles per hour ii maximum width of any vehicular moving or turning lane shall be eleven 11 feet iii width of any curbside parallel parking lane shall be eight 8 feet angled headin parking and ninety 90 degree parking shall not be used within a street rightofway iv where bicycle lanes are desired they should occur between the curb and the rightofway line in a manner that allocates sufficient space for pedestrians landscaping and bicycles with minimal conflicts v center medians where provided shall be a minimum of twelve 12 feet wide center medians are encouraged when feasible vi pavement radii shall be a minimum of fifteen 15 feet designs should endeavor to provide the minimum pavement radii possible 2 sidewalks sidewalks shall be provided at all lot frontages i minimum sidewalk width shall be eight 8 feet for a streets minimum sidewalk width shall be ten 10 feet where possible when a sidewalk is intended as a multiuse path the minimum width shall be twelve 12 feet ii on a and b street frontages with predominantly retail uses at the ground level the sidewalk width should increase as needed to abut the building face directly 3 curbside parking curbside parking should be provided wherever possible on a and b streets i curbside parking lane shall be designated as a dedicated use zone by the use of bulbouts that clearly distinguish the parking from the moving lanes ii minimum length of any bulbout measured parallel to the rightofway line shall be twenty 20 feet when occurring at midblock or forty 40 feet at street intersections the measured length of a bulbout may include any angled curb segments if provided iii parallel parking spaces shall be grouped together between bulbouts there shall be a minimum of two 2 and a maximum of six 6 spaces in any one 1 group angled parking shall be grouped a minimum of three 3 and a maximum of eight 8 spaces between bulbouts iv grouping of spaces should be based on achieving a deliberate rhythm along the block face so that for example bulbouts occur at mid block or at the third points or some other discernable rationale where a rhythm has already been established on the opposite side of the street the parking pattern shall to the greatest practical extent mirror the established rhythm 4 rightofway landscaping the area between the curb and the sidewalk shall be landscaped in accordance with the following guidelines i the type of landscaping shall be appropriate to the width available between the curb and the edge of sidewalk a less than six 6 feet low ground cover may be augmented by small scale trees in general landscape strips of less than five 5 feet in width are discouraged b over six 6 feet low ground cover augmented by larger scale trees c placement of any landscape materials shall maintain all required sight distances and comply with the appropriate visibility standards ii in general landscaping along a and b streets or along other principal pedestrian walks shall leave a relatively unobstructed horizontal view from normal vantage points dense ground covers shall remain low and tree canopies should be well above head height rightofway landscaping shall not obstruct horizontal views iii linear landscape elements along a and b streets should exhibit regular spacing and consistent size trees should be selected for their ability to shade the sidewalk iv the amount of landscape elements should relate to the development context along a streets in a fairly urban commercial setting with minimal setbacks a predominance of paving with regularly spaced trees would be appropriate while in more residential areas with larger setbacks larger landscape beds with more planting would be called for v the linear elements should be augmented by accent landscaping at special features such as street intersections entry courts bulbouts between parking lanes and other such areas where opportunities for larger landscaped areas present themselves these areas may incorporate a number of enhancements including beds for seasonal color benches fountains or public art vi where curbside parking abuts a landscape strip the following should be provided a a continuous paving strip abutting the back of curb minimum two 2 feet wide for the convenience of persons exiting the passenger side of a parked vehicle b regularly spaced paved crossovers connecting the curb and the sidewalk spacing should be coordinated with the specific streetscape design but should generally not exceed forty 40 feet  5122004   8202008   7232014 development intensity a residential density 1 allowable density the baseline maximum density for residential uses is twentyfive 25 dwelling unitsunit per acre 2 density calculation in general density is calculated by dividing the total number of proposed units by the number of acres of site area in cases where a large site under unified ownership is to be developed as several uses allocated to different areas of the site the density calculation may be subject to an alternate method that determines the actual site area impacted by only the residential use this calculation shall be performed as follows i place the actual building footprint on a site assumed to extend twenty 20 feet beyond the edges of the building on all sides the assumed site may fill in irregularities in the building footprint to allow for amenity courts ii add site area for provided parking at the rate of four hundred 400 square feet per car provided that no more than four 4 floors of building shall be parked on any one 1 level eg eight 8 stories of residential development must be parked on at least two 2 levels of parking  iii the resulting equivalent site area to be used for density calculation is the sum of the areas determined in steps i and ii above iv the governing density for purposes of this shall be calculated by using the lesser of the actual site area or the equivalent site area v for sites proposing to redevelop existing structures where at least sixty 60 percent of the existing building footprints will be demolished the density calculation according to the equivalent site area is waived alternative density calculation the equivalent site area is the sum of the area needed for the building footprint plus its associated parking alternative density calculation if the proposed building has more than four 4 stories the site area for parking shall assume that the parking is structured thus the calculated area required for parking shall be divided by the appropriate number of parking levels minimum of one 1 level for every four 4 floors of building to yield the equivalent site area attributable to parking 3 density increases for sites where the equivalent site area calculation governs the density may be increased above the baseline up to a maximum of fifty 50 unitsunit per acre provided that the density does not exceed the maximum gross density permitted by the city of plantation comprehensive plan the impact of the added density must be compensated by one 1 or more of the following means i paying a midtown infrastructure fee per added unit over twentyfive 25 unitsunit per acre ii dedicating public open space of five hundred 500 square feet per added unit over twentyfive 25 unitsunit per acre provided a two thousand 2000 square feet of open space is the minimum dedication corresponding to four 4 added units b the open space must be in addition to that required by any setback and lot coverage requirements c the space must be for general public use and shall be located so that it enhances the public realm of the streets d the space must be contiguous wellproportioned and landscaped in accordance with section 27627 of this iii for buildings that integrate mixed uses vertically within the same structure a livework units that consist of flexible office space at ground level need not be counted as units for purposes of density calculations b residential buildings that include nonresidential uses intended for independent occupancy not related to the residential use for at least fifty 50 percent of the ground floor area are permitted a maximum baseline density of thirty 30 unitsunit per acre density may be increased above thirty 30 to a maximum of fifty 50 by the methods described in items i and ii above b lot dimensions 1 minimum lot area i residential uses including livework units two thousand 2000 square feet ii nonresidential uses five thousand 5000 square feet 2 minimum lot width width as used here refers to the width of the lot at the front property line i residential uses including livework units twenty 20 feet ii nonresidential uses fifty 50 feet c bulk and massing regulations 1 building placement and frontage i buildings shall have their primary orientation towards the highest classified street a is classified higher than b and so on ii building massing shall be distributed to define the block faces a minimum width of the building defined as a percentage of the corresponding lot frontage shall be placed within a specified buildto zone as follows a a streets minimum seventyfive 75 percent of lot width b b streets minimum fifty 50 percent of lot width c c and d streets no minimum requirement minimum required building frontage iii a minimum percentage of the lineal width of the ground floor frontage on a and b streets shall be open or glazed reflective or strongly tinted glazing is not permitted the minimum aggregate width of openings is as follows a a streets minimum fifty 50 percent of building frontage for residential uses including livework units the minimum width of glazing may be reduced to thirty 30 percent of the building frontage b b streets minimum thirty 30 percent of building frontage aggregate width of opening   a + b + c iv a maximum of twentyfive 25 percent of the required frontage may be set back to form an open courtyard or plaza space such spaces must be continuously open to the public and building faces defining the court space shall be considered as frontage for purposes of the minimum opening requirements stipulated above the concentration of glazing on the courtyard elevations does not reduce the minimum glazing requirements for the street elevations frontage may be set back to form a courtyard or plaza space 2 setbacks and buildto zones i front a a street buildto zone of between five 5 and ten 10 feet b b street buildto zone of between ten 10 and twenty 20 feet c c street setback of forty 40 feet minimum provided however a minimum one hundredfoot setback shall be provided on the west side of c street university drive north of sw 10th street and south of broward boulevard d d street setback of twenty 20 feet minimum e undesignated street setback of twenty 20 feet minimum ii side same as front based on the classification of the enfronting side street side setbacks for adjacent lots on the same block may be zero 0 feet subject to respecting any existing easements or life safety code requirements if at least one 1 other enfronting street of equal or higher classification is designated as the primary frontage the buildto requirement for the street designated as the side street is waived iii rear same as front except that if at least one 1 other enfronting street of equal or higher classification is designated as the primary frontage the buildto requirement for the street designated as the rear street is waived iv notwithstanding the above the minimum building setback for buildings abutting single family homes or a single family zoning district shall be one and onehalf 112 times maximum building height for the purposes of this subsection buildings separated by a canal or local street from single family homes or a single family zoning district shall be equivalent to abutting the single family homes or single family zoning district if the frontage requirement for the a street is satisfied hatched then the b street frontage requirement dashed is waived a street and b street frontage d lot coverage and floor area ratio 1 the baseline maximum for lot coverage and floor area ratio far for development of a single building on a parcel of land shall be as specified in table 27624 d below table 27624d allowable lot coverage and floor area ratio number of stories coverage floorarea ratio 1 030 030 2 030 060 3 030 090 4 029 100 5 027 112 6 025 114 7 023 115 8 021 118 9 020 120 10 019 122 11 018 124 12 017 126 2 the baseline maximum for lot coverage and floor area ratio far for development of multiple buildings on a parcel of land shall be as specified in table 27624 e below number of stories coverage floorarea ratio varying height 030 085 3 allowable increases new or redeveloped projects may increase the baseline allowable coverage and far in accordance with the incentives listed in section 27624f below provided that the proposed development meets all requirements for the appropriate street frontages as specified in this code 4 in no case shall the combined coverage of buildings and parking structures on any site exceed eighty 80 percent of the site area 5 the minimum floor area per dwelling unit shall be as follows a efficiency unit square feet 600 b one bedroom unit square feet 750 c two bedroom unit square feet 950 d each additional bedroom shall increase the total required floor area by no less than square feet 150 e height 1 overall building height in the district is limited to twelve 12 stories but may not exceed one hundred fifty 150 feet 2 for purposes of the height calculation any minor appurtenances set back at least twenty 20 feet from the edge of the main building mass eg elevator penthouses or roofmounted equipment need not be counted 3 on a streets that portion of the building face within the required buildto zone the street facade shall not exceed five 5 stories or sixtyfive 65 feet any portion of the building that exceeds this height shall be set back a minimum of twenty 20 feet from the street facade 4 on b streets that portion of the building face within the required buildto zone the street facade shall not exceed three 3 stories or fortyfive 45 feet in height any portion of the building that exceeds this height must be set back a minimum of twenty 20 feet from the street facade 5 where a building occupies a corner at the intersection of an a and b street the five 5 storysixtyfivefoot limit may wrap the corner along the b street for a maximum of fifty 50 feet a building on the corner of a and b streets the tower must be set back twenty 20 feet from the building faces on both streets building on corner of a street and b streets f incentives incentives in the form of additional allowable lot coverage and floor area ratio shall be granted based on the criteria listed below 1 frontage bonus each development parcel shall calculate the percentage of the parcel perimeter that fronts on either a or b streets total allowable lot coverage and far may be increased by that same percentage in cases where more than one side of the lot fronts on an a or b street the buildto requirements for the lower ranked street may be waived but the waived frontage would not be eligible for the frontage bonus example a tract has twelve hundred 1200 feet of perimeter of which six hundred 600 feet front on streets classified as a or b this tract is entitled to a fifty 50 percent increase in allowable coverage and far 6001200 if the developer elects to waive the b street buildto requirement only twentyfive 25 percent bonus 3001200 is granted 2 grid bonus large contiguous tracts are encouraged to be subdivided into multiple blocks subject to the following standards i the new street shall connect to the existing street network at both ends no bonus is granted for culdesacs ii the new street need not be deeded to the city but it must remain accessible to the public at all times and shall not have any access control devices iii the minimum width of the new street rightofway shall be sixty 60 feet iv the minimum length of any new street segment measured from the rightofway lines of the intersecting streets shall be two hundred fifty 250 feet v the new street segments shall be reasonably straight and shall intersect existing streets at a right angle vi the new street segment may be classified according to the citys discretion vii the realignment of an existing street segment that is considered a priority segment by the master plan shall be considered a new segment for purposes of calculating this bonus the realigned segment must maintain or increase the current street classification viii the grid bonus is calculated as follows all new a and b street frontage created may be added to the perimeter a and b frontage and the resulting sum divided by the original parcel perimeter to determine the allowable percentage increase in coverage and far example a square tract six hundred sixty 660 feet on a side is subdivided into four 4 smaller square blocks three hundred 300 feet on a side by introducing two 2 new streets that bisect the tract in both directions the original perimeter is two thousand six hundred forty 2640 feet the subdivided blocks create an additional twentyfour hundred 2400 feet of street frontage if the new streets are classified as a or b the allowable increase in coverage and far is 2400264 or ninetyone 91 percent the frontage and grid bonuses are cumulative that is if twelve hundred 1200 feet of the original perimeter fronts on streets classified a or b the total percentage increase would be 1200+2400264 or one hundred thirtysix 136 percent 3 eligibility for bonuses the frontage and grid bonuses shall only be calculated for that portion of the frontage that is developed in compliance with the standards of this the grid bonus example cited above the new blocks would be overly well endowed with a and b frontage it would be difficult  but not impossible  to develop the entire frontage to the standards of this this reason the setback requirements may be waived for a and b frontages designated as side or rear facades c2 above in such cases these side or rear frontages are not eligible to be included in the bonus calculation 4 open space bonus the allowable floor area may be increased by dedicating public open space on a twoforone basis ie the amount of allowable area increase is equal to two 2 times the area of open space dedicated the minimum amount of open space dedication per project to be eligible for this bonus is two thousand 2000 square feet open space shall comply with the design standards listed in subsection 27627b of this a developer grants open space in exchange for additional density according to the provisions of subsection 27624a3 that open space may not be applied toward additional floor area allowable building area the allowable building area may be increased by twice the area of open space created  5122004   4192006   8202008 parking a required onsite parking all new development in the district shall provide onsite parking in accordance with the provisions of section 27743 of the plantation calculating the required parking fractional spaces shall be rounded up or down to the nearest whole number b allowable reductions in required onsite parking the required amount of onsite parking may be reduced in accordance with any of the following provisions these provisions may be applied cumulatively 1 curbside parking the developer may provide curbside parallel parking spaces for any a and b street frontage abutting the site this parking may count towards the required amount of onsite parking in a two 2 to one 1 ratio eg ten 10 curbside parking spaces would reduce the onsite parking requirement by twenty 20 spaces a minimum of four 4 curbside parking spaces must be provided to be eligible for this reduction 2 mixeduse parking for mixed uses on the same site the parking may be shared among the uses in accordance with the following provisions a calculate parking required for each use separately b refer to table 27625 for the permissible shared parking divisor for any two 2 uses the minimum mixeduse parking requirement is determined by dividing the sum of the parking required for each use independently by the divisor indicated for that particular combination of uses table 27625 mixeduse parking divisors residential office retail lodging recreational institutional residential 10 office 14 10 retail 12 12 10 lodging 11 16 13 10 civic recreational 11 15 12 12 10 civic institutional 13 11 12 14 14 10 example a mixeduse development combines residential and retail uses on one 1 site calculated separately the residential requires one hundred twenty 120 spaces and the retail requires forty 40 spaces the permissible minimum parking for both uses combined is one hundred thirtythree 133 spaces 120+4012 c for developments that mix two 2 or more classes of uses as listed in table 27625 on a site eg residential and office retail and lodging etc they shall be considered mixeduse and a mixeduse parking reduction shall only be permitted for one 1 combination of uses the developer may use whichever combination yields the largest reduction in required parking and then add the parking required for the other uses d the mixeduse parking benefit is intended for uses that meet the following requirements 1 all uses are well integrated in close proximity and are not physically or geographically separated 2 dedicated pedestrian connectivity is provided between all uses 3 parking for all uses is unrestricted no temporary or permanent barriers and equally available 247 without limitation and 4 all parking areas are subject to a recordable shared parking agreement approved in advance of the building permit excluding the foundation permit by the city and which is binding upon all owners and mortgagees of the property affected and which cannot be amended or released without the citys consent 5 regardless of the result of the shared parking calculation the total parking on a site shall not be reduced to an amount less than that required for any use by itself c design of surface parking areas 1 surface parking areas shall be set back a minimum of fifty 50 feet from any a or b street frontage and shall to the greatest extent practicable be located behind the principal building face in cases where the buildto requirements for a secondary frontage are waived refer to subsection 27624c2 the fiftyfoot parking setback may be reduced to a fifteenfoot landscape buffer 2 surface parking areas shall be separated from public rightsofway by landscape buffers and shall have internal landscaping in accordance with the provisions of section 27627 of this 3 requirements for other elements such as paving materials lighting drainage etc shall be as required by the plantation shall comply with section 27627 of this d design of parking garages 1 parking garages are encouraged to be located at the interiors of blocks and screened from view from the street rightsofway by being placed behind or within the principal building form 2 a and b streets shall have no parking garage frontage on the ground floor for any parking garage fronting on an a or b street the ground floor street frontage must be enclosed and occupied by some commercial use other than parking for a minimum depth of twenty 20 feet a parking access drive may be located along such frontages but is limited to a width not to exceed thirty 30 feet including any associated attendant booths ticket pedestals etc and may occur only once for any two hundred 200 feet of frontage parking garage fronting parking garage fronting on a or b streets shall have occupied space at the ground floor for a minimum depth of twenty 20 feet 3 elevated buildings ie buildings where the occupied space is located above a ground floor parking area shall have occupied ground floor space on a and b street frontages as described in item 2 above 4 upper floor elevations of parking garages fronting on a or b streets shall be treated with a highquality architectural design and finish intended to mitigate the appearance of an open parking garage no sloping ramps spandrel elements etc shall be visible at such frontages  5122004   8202008   9192012 architectural requirements a intent buildings shall be of substantial design and construction using high quality materials and workmanship be site responsive recognize

supporting role however in providing shade visual and textural relief and recreational opportunities landscape design should adhere to the following principles 1 landscaping at a street frontages is intended primarily to enhance the pedestrian experience and should consist of regularly spaced shade trees and low ground cover plantings for retail frontages no or minimal landscaping should occur between the sidewalk and the building face in general pedestrians should have a clear line of sight at eye level between building faces on either side of the street 2 on a and b streets landscaping should play a supporting role and help to accent and enhance the architecture the screening of the building face with planting is neither appropriate nor desirable 3 for c and d streets or for unsightly service and support functions landscaping may be used as buffer and screen elements 4 open space should be consolidated into usable park and green spaces b design standards these design standards are to be used in conjunction with the requirements of chapter 13 of the plantation general this for an alternative standard that may be used in lieu of the existing standard 1 landscape elements broadly defined landscaping features are grouped into the following functional categories i screens and hedges dense and closely spaced plantings in a linear arrangement intended to form a visual barrier and a deterrent to access ii lawns low horizontal planting consisting of any of various species of grasses or low ground covers intended to define the ground plane iii trees and arbors trees or other plants intended to provide shade along streets arbors generally take the form of a regularly spaced row of trees in special circumstances certain creeping or climbing plants trained onto a structure may also be used as an arbor iv beds defined areas of planting used for accent purposes that may contain a wide variety of plantings including seasonal color beds may be very formal requiring a high degree of maintenance or may be natural areas of native species requiring minimal maintenance v hardscape any of a variety of manmade elements including pavement benches lighting waste receptacles shade structures public art fountains etc vi gardens landscaped areas containing several of the above elements arranged in a thoughtful and useful manner and suitable for passive or active use and enjoyment 2 public open space this designed to place buildings close to public streets rather than to surround buildings with yard areas this will allow for the consolidation of the required open space into usable areas while this open space may be in the form of private courtyards incentives are granted in section 27624 to provide public open space as a community amenity the following standards apply to public open space i access the space must be for general public use at all times with no restrictions to access at least one 1 side shall front on a public way ii size surface area shall be a minimum of two thousand 2000 square feet with a minimum dimension of twenty 20 feet along any side the area classified as open space must be open from the ground to the sky except that up to ten 10 percent of the area may be covered by shade structures or service buildings iii location open space is most effective when contrasted against an urban context and when defined by buildings on several sides open space should not be located near other open spaces open spaces should also be used to mark significant intersections or as forecourts for civic buildings or other buildings with a high degree of public access iv frontage any building face that fronts on a public open space shall be treated as if it fronted on an a or b street as appropriate for the particular situation v design wide latitude is afforded the designer but the design should be sensitive to local conditions and context whatever the design the open space should be usable peoplefriendly and responsive to the local climate large undifferentiated expanses of pavement or landscape areas intended primarily for ornamental use should be avoided vi only areas exceeding the minimum previous area of twenty 20 percent requirement of the net lot area can be considered for calculation of open space bonuses 3 buffers landscape buffers shall be provided as described below i the minimum width of the

recognize that service stations are a special class of land use distinguished by unique characteristics related to their physical appearances their need for specialized structures their hours of operation and both the noise and traffic they generate while recognizing the need for such use the city intends to preserve its community appearance to safeguard and enhance property values of surrounding residential commercial and industrial areas and to reduce potential safety conflicts which arise between motorists and pedestrians in connection with such use in addition the purpose and intent of these regulations are predicated on the following a a survey of existing gasoline service stations within the city reveals an even distribution of service station sites throughout the city with an apparent locational emphasis on accessibility to motorists b the city has many arterial roadways which divide the city and because of continuing development surrounding the city especially to the west of plantation where the sawgrass mills mall is being expanded and the new florida panthers sports arena complex is being erected such roadways are used by an increasingly significant number of persons who do not live or work in the city but instead commute city c gasoline service stations select potential sites based primarily on roadway passerby traffic patterns and the number of existing stations serving same and consequently have an increasing number of customers who do not live or work in the city and thus they do not provide a service to the citys residents or satisfy a community need within the city d the city does not wish to encourage traffic congestion on roadways within the city by allowing additional gasoline stations to be located thereon for the use and benefit of drivee despite significant advances in construction which minimizes the likelihood of environmental damage from gasoline stations a significant number of sites within plantation have been identified by the broward county department of natural resources protection as known contaminated sites which are in varying degrees of cleanup and monitoring and further the florida department of environmental regulation has reported that the average costs of removing underground storage tanks and contaminated soil hauling in clean fill and installing pollution monitoring equipment is between two hundred fifty thousand dollars $25000000 and three hundred thousand dollars $30000000 per site the following provisions are therefore established for service stations to ensure that such uses are
