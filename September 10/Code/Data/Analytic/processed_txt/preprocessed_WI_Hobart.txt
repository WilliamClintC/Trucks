and intent  2211 hobart code  2212  1 this section is a regulatory measure aimed at protecting the health and safety of children in the village of hobart from the risk that sexual offenders convicted of an offense against a child may reoffend in locations close to where children congregate given the high rate of recidivism for sexual offenders and that reducing opportunity and temptation is important to minimizing the risk of reoffense there is a need to protect children where they congregate or play in public places therefore the village finds and declares that sexual offenders are a serious threat to the public safety of children if regulatory measures are not in place that prohibit their presence in specified areas designated as places children commonly congregate the village of hobart finds and declares that in addition to schools and daycare centers children congregate or play at childoriented facilities such as parks and playgrounds 2 it is not the intent of this section to impose a criminal penalty but rather to serve the villages compelling interest to promote protect and improve the health safety and welfare of the children of the village by prohibiting convicted sexual offenders from loitering or being present in specified areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers it is the further intent of this section to recognize that convicted sexual offenders must reenter the community and the village of hobart hereby accepts that it has a responsibility to convicted sexual offenders and the surrounding area municipalities
