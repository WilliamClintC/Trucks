purpose a the town council finds that the state of california california waste management act of 198 assembly bill 939 ab 939 requires that each local jurisdiction in the state divert 50 percent of solid waste from landfill by  reduction recycling and composting activities b the town council finds that every city and county in california including the town could face fines up to $1000000 a day for not meeting the above mandated goal c the town council finds and determines that the town is committed to protecting the public health safety welfare and environment d in order to meet these goals it is necessary that the town promote the reduction of solid waste and reduce the stream of solid waste going to landfills e debris from demolition and construction of buildings represents approximately onethird or more of the volume presently going to landfill from woodside and much of said debris is particularly suitable for recycling f the town finds that reuse and recycling of certain portions of construction and demolition debris is essential to further the towns efforts to reduce solid waste and comply with ab 939 mandates g the town finds that except in unusual circumstances it is feasible to divert an average of at least 60 percent of all construction and demolition debris from construction demolition and renovation covered projects h the town council recognizes that requiring construction and demolition debris to be recycled and reused may in some respects add modestly to the cost of demolition and in other respects may make possible some cost

the tcad to parcels where the owners were assessed full assessments d the town has an adopted master plan of proposed local sanitary sewer facilities in the redwood creek main trunk sewer service area dated may 1974 hereinafter the master plan which requires that sewer service be available to parcels in the rcs for implementation of the master plan e the town previously estimated in that there were approximately 13500 gallons per day of estimated excess sewer capacity in the rcs beyond capacity being used or reserved for parcels with full assessments the estimated excess sewer capacity would allow for up to 54 residential equivalent units or residential connections to the rcs based on an estimated 250 gallons per day of sewer usage per residential household f the town has conducted a study of residential water usage in the rcs for the years 199599 during the wet weather months of january february and march when internal water usage closely matches sewer flow the town has determined that residential sewer usage in the rcs averages approximately 2919 gallons per day per household this substantially exceeds the previous estimate of 250 gallons per day which was the basis for the finding in of excess sewer capacity g there are 299 residential connections to the rcs which at 2919 gallons per day is equal to 87278 gallons per day of sewer usage h there remain 254 residential properties with paid full assessments for which the town is required to reserve capacity to connect to the rcs these properties represent a minimum potential of 74143 gallons per day of

provisions of this subchapter effective 112201 secs 55475550  reserved article iv  variance procedure nature of variances a the variance criteria set forth in this subsection are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners b it is the duty of the town council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare c the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate effective 112201 appeal board a in passing upon requests for variances the town council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges b any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency effective 112201 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the town council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the town council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in  to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance  cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections  5553ae are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the town council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter effective 112201 title vii  traffic code chapter 70  general provisions article i  general provisions definitions for the

effective 51481 chapter 97  smoking in public places findings and purpose the town council finds that a numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution 1 in the united states surgeon generals report on the health consequences of secondhand tobacco smoke the medical community has generally concluded that nonsmokers subjected to tobacco smoke are at risk for the development of lung cancer in addition there are serious health consequences including respiratory malfunctions and irritation that may result from inhaling tobacco smoke 2 the california legislature by the california indoor clean air act of 197 and cal health & safety et seq has found and declared that tobacco is a hazard to the health of the general public  b reliable studies have shown that breathing smoke exhaled or otherwise produced or caused by others secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard particularly for certain population groups including elderly people individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory functions including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease  c health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung cancer respiratory infection decreased respiratory functions bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm  d nonsmokers with allergies respiratory diseases and those who suffer other ill effects of breathing secondhand smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of adverse reactions to the same  e numerous studies have shown that a majority of both nonsmokers and smokers desire to have restrictions on smoking in public places and places of employment  and f smoking is a documented cause of fires  g nonsmokers should have a right to be free from exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke from those who use tobacco  h the town council concurs in the findings of the california legislature and the united states attorney general and in addition finds that the california indoor clean air act of 197 as amended should be expanded by local regulation not inconsistent with the provisions thereof and as authorized by cal health & safety 6  i the town council further finds that the regulations enacted in this chapter are not within the provisions of the california environmental quality act in that the effect of the ordinance codified in this chapter is to have a beneficial effect on the public health safety and welfare rather than an adverse effect and therefor this chapter is not a project under the california environmental quality act  j accordingly the town council finds and declares that the purposes of this chapter are to protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places except in designated smoking areas and by regulating smoking in places of employment  and strike a reasonable balance between the needs of smokers and the need of nonsmokers to breathe smokefree air and to recognize that where these needs conflict the need to breathe smokefree air shall have priority 1975 01 effective 11990 definitions for the purpose of this chapter the following definitions

classifications where the minimum lot size is either five acres 7 acres or ten acres and where minimum lot size for newly created lots shall increase as the average slope of the lot increases for lots over 15 percent average slope where the provisions of this chapter apply the purpose of the scp district is to provide for reduced human densities for lands containing characteristics such as but not limited to steep hillsides geological hazards difficult road access or soil or water problems and to implement the policies of the general plan below are guidelines for scp district classification 1 findings a in 198 the town council adopted a revised woodside general plan said general plan set forth certain policies for evaluating lot densities goals for development defining environmentally sensitive areas and the constraints found therein b also in 1988 and 198 the town staff did a detailed study of the various constraints as identified in general plan policy 2111 a constraints map of the town was prepared herein the map the most constrained areas were compared with other zoning districts to determine whether their zoning designation reflected the level of constraints shown for the property it was determined that areas with greater constraints were zoned with a similar density to areas less constrained c a broader range of districts for environmentally sensitive areas were created for the scp zoning district as set forth in division a1 above which districts were created to allow residential density to be varied in the scp district according to environmental constraints d in order to provide greater consistency with the general plan and to provide guidelines for application of the scp zoning classifications the following regulations shall apply 2 constraintsdefinitions environmental constraints have been identified in the town  the towns constraints map dated april 198 on file with the town clerk  is incorporated herein by reference the

pursuant to the applicable rules and regulations of the town in effect at the time of subdivision  5 identification of constraints identification of constraints affecting a parcel shall be determined by the planning director  with the assistance of town staff the planning director shall make such determination in accordance with the following procedure a ascertain the constraints affecting the parcel   b ascertain the percentage of the parcel subject to one constraint then two constraints and then to each respective multiple of constraints thereafter up to a maximum of six constraints c a parcel shall be identified as having a total number of constraints for classification purposes equal to the number of constraints shown for 50 percent or more of the parcels area counting backwards from the areas subject to the greatest number of constraints for example a parcel of 600 acres is identified as having 15 percent 90 acres with constraints 20 percent 120 acres with constraints 60 percent 360 acres with constraints five percent 30 acres with constraints and zero percent with five or six constraints counting backwards from the higher number of constraints 50 percent of the property is reached with three constraints this property would be assigned to the scp 75 district classification d in addition a parcel shall be classified as if 50 percent of its property were subject to one additional constraint where the total parcel is subject to four or more constraints for example in the 600acre parcel above there are constraints applicable to the property instead of being classified with constraints as are applicable to 50 percent of its area it would be classified with constituents due to the greater number four or more of constraints that apply overall to the property it would be classified therefore in the scp10 district classification b the rr district is a rural residential classification where the minimum threeacre lot size requirement for newly

community commercial district utilizes building coverage  in place of floor area  see for building coverage requirements measurement and exceptions table f  floor area calculation method step 1 divide the floor plan of the building into nonoverlapping rectangular triangular and circular sections each with the following characteristics a the slope of the grade under each section remains the same over the entire section 5% if the slope changes by more than 5% break the section into multiple sections at the point that the slope changes b if the roof line changes eg a second story start a new section at that point note floor area is counted to the outside of the exterior stud wall  thick finishes and veneers or unused spaces such as decorative pilasters are also included in floor area  step 2 add up the plate heights at each corner of the section and divide the total by four if the section is a rectangle and divide by three if the section is a triangle if the section is a circle measure the plate height at the center this gives the average plate height aph for each section the plate height is the distance from the existing grade at the time of application or finished grade whichever is lower to the intersection of the exterior wall plane with the underside of the roof plane flat soffits do not lower the plate height clarification 1 plates do not run up the ends of gable roofs but are assumed to run in a straight line from the plate height at one corner of the building to the plate height at the other corner clarification 2 plates do run along the roof line of shed roofs which are defined as a roof which terminates at its high point with a wall which has more than four feet exposed clarification 3 plates do run along roofs that have a pitch greater than  which are considered a wall  clarification 4 gambrel roofs and parapets are a judgment call by the planning director based on the pitch of the gambrel and the appearance of the roof step 3 if the average plate height for a section is 11 feet or less the floor area for that section is equal to its footprint area if the average plate height of a section is over 11 feet multiply the footprint area of that section by an additional 01 for each foot the average plate height aph is over 11 feet example if a sections aph is 13 feet multiply the corresponding footprint area by 12 to get that sections

establish a procedure allowing for flexible design of all residential zoned properties in hillside areas or elsewhere so that development may be concentrated in those areas with the greatest environmental carrying capacity and limited in areas with low environmental carrying capacity  3 to establish a procedure or eliminate the rigidity delays and inequities that otherwise would result from the application of conventional residential setback regulations designed primarily for larger parcels or more level sites  4 to establish a procedure whereby the town may authorize desirable residential developments consistent with the spirit and intent of the general plan and the zoning ordinance without requiring numerous and difficult variance applications  5 to encourage variety avoid monotony and maintain natural features of residential areas by allowing property owners greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access light open space and amenities b exception procedures
