shown to the satisfaction of the director that a substantial portion of the water as measured by the aforesaid meter or meters does not enter the sanitary sewer system of the city then the director may require or permit the installation of additional meters at the owners expense in such manner as to measure the quantity of water actually entering the sanitary sewerage system from the lot parcel of land building or premises of such owner or occupant and the quantity of water used to determine the sewer service charge and abnormal sewage surcharge may be the quantity of water actually entering the sewerage system as so determined if the director so elects cif the director finds that it is not practicable to measure the quantity or quality of waste by the aforesaid meters or monitoring
