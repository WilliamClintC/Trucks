thereof described in said resolution as running from the southeast corner of land belonging to the tariffville manufacturing company thence south eightyone degrees west fourteen hundred thirty links

for storms with return frequencies ranging from2 years at a minimum or as dictated by the commission 5 the procedure for computing the outflow from detention areas consists of the development for synthetic hydrographs and routing of these hydrographs detention basin if a significant amount of drainage which is not controlled by the detention is effective at the site composite hydrographs correlating in time the outflow from the detention basin and the flow from the uncontrolled may be required to determine the design discharge applicable at the site the method developed by the soil

commission by the connecticut general statutes and the charter and ordinances of the town of bloomfield connecticut 51b finding of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of bloomfield are subject to periodic flood inundation which results in the loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are exacerbated by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damage uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community 3 bloomfield voluntarily participates in the national flood insurance program nfip the nfip is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating community local state and federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the nfip the communitys role is of paramount importance property owners are able to receive federallysubsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the nfip 51c purpose it is the purpose of these regulations to regulate floodplain development promote public health safety and general welfare and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas designed 1 to protect human life and health and prevent damage to property  2 to minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at public expense  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions and other economic disruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities infrastructure and utilities  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize flood damage and flood blight areas  7 to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area  8 to prevent increase in flood heights that could exacerbate flood damage and result in conflicts between property owners  9 to ensure that those who occupy the flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions  page | 72  bloomfield zoning regulations    10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 c 10 to discourage development in a floodplain if there is any practicable alternative to locate the activity use or structure outside of the floodplain  and 11 for bloomfield to fulfill its role and comply with its obligations as a participant in the nfip 51d objectives in order to accomplish its purposes these regulations include objectives methods and provisions that 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to flood or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 51e application of these regulations these regulations shall apply to all development in special flood hazard areas sfha within

in order to determine whether public services such as fire ambulance and public works can be reasonably provided to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation and to minimize adverse visual impacts on the character of the community 2 it is not the intent of the tmod to prohibit or preclude development in designated areas rather the tmod is intended to establish a process whereby property owners interests in capitalizing on scenic views or other assets can be balanced with the communitys desire to provide a reasonable level of services and to protect environmentally sensitive steep slopes and hillsides from inappropriate development 52b general 1 the extensive and essentially undisturbed talcott mountain range is a defining feature of bloomfield 2 experience in other communities has shown that if these resources are not protected insensitive development of ridgelines and steep slopes can adversely affect the availability of public services harm important natural resources and detract from community character 3 because of their steepness and prominent visibility the areas within the tmod need stricter standards to protect them from excessive or inappropriate development 4 these standards should strike an appropriate balance between the use of private property and the commissions responsibility to protect the public health safety and welfare the integrity of the steep slopes and the scenic views within the community 52c delineation 1 the tmod as delineated on the zoning map shall be superimposed on underlying zoning districts and the standards in this apply in addition to

such as fire ambulance and public works can be provided at all times and in all seasons to current and future owners of the property 2 the extent to which any proposed activity will cause erosion or slipping of soil or cause sediment to be discharged including whether a the stability of soils will be adequate to support any proposed construction landscaping agricultural use or similar activities b the natural stability of the soil on the site has been used to determine the proper placement of structures and other development within the steep slope area c all construction shall be accomplished in conformance with the erosion prevention provisions of the connecticut guidelines for erosion and sediment control as amended d such operation will occur with an acceptable conservation plan so that it will not leave an objectionable scar on the landscape e the extent to which existing vegetation will help to retain the stability of the slopes and soils including whether f plant life located on the slopes outside of the minimum area that needs to be disturbed for carrying on approved development will be retained g plants or other acceptable ground cover will be reestablished in the disturbed area immediately upon completion of development activities to maintain the natural scenic characteristics of any steep slope the extent to which storm water drainage will be designed and located to ensure slope stability and not 1 cause erosion or siltation 2 contribute to slope failure 3 pollute groundwater or 4 cause damage to or flooding of property h the extent to which care will be taken to protect scenic views scenic vistas scenic roads and unique aesthetic features such as prominent ridgelines from damage obstruction or other degradation i the extent to which there is an alternative location for the proposed development on that portion of the site not containing steep slopes or an alternative location on that portion of the site having fewer impacts on sensitive resources

changes associated with building demolition building construction and site development in order to 1 protect the public safety and general welfare  2 prevent adverse impacts to other property due to erosion sedimentation and increases in storm water runoff  3 prevent sedimentation of public and private streets  4 prevent sedimentation of public storm sewer and drainage systems  5 reduce the risk
