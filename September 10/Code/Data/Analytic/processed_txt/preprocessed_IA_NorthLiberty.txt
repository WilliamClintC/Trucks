maximum rate of flow to prevent downstream flooding  and 2enable the city to comply with its national pollution discharge elimination system permit npdes and applicable statutes and regulations for storm water runoff though the following objectives aminimize increases in storm water runoff from development within the city limits and fringe area in order to reduce flooding siltation increases in stream temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels  bminimize increases in nonpoint pollution caused by storm water runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality  cminimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific development project site after completion to not exceed the predevelopment

management standards and best management practices bmps and to ensure that bmps are maintained and pose no threat to public safety 15602 findings 1the united states environmental agencys epa national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit program administered by the iowa department of natural resources idnr requires that cities meeting certain demographic and environmental criteria obtain from the idnr an npdes permit for the discharge of storm water from a municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 permit the city is subject to the npdes permit program and is required to obtain and has in fact obtained an ms4 permit  the citys ms4 permit is on file at the office of the city clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office hours 2as a condition of the citys ms4 permit the city is obliged to adopt and enforce a postconstruction storm water runoff control land development and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  this storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  and storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of storm water runoff from development sites 4therefore the city establishes this set of city storm water standards applicable to all surface waters to provide for reasonable guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it is determined that the regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in storm water runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with storm water runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public safety and welfare 5the determination of appropriate minimum storm water management standards and the development of effective best management practices to achieve those standards require technical expertise that may not always be readily available with the citys own staff moreover it is important that such standards and bmps be reasonably consistent across the state so that property owners and developers are not confronted with myriad variations depending on the location of the development the iowa storm water management manual published collaboratively by the iowa

situation of the current owner of the property and that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner bnot exclusively for financial gain the purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase financial gain from the property proof that the property cannot be used for its highest or best use under the regulations applicable to it or that it could be used more
