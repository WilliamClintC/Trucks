available information from inspections monitoring reporting plant upsets and private complaints 2compliance screening this process involves the review of all available information and monitoring data to sort out noncomplying discharges for appropriate enforcement response this initial review will address as appropriate compliance with required schedules compliance with reporting features or compliance or both with applicable categorical standards and local limitations ordinance 3emergency response if evaluation of the data reveals an emergency condition the city will take whatever means appropriate to bring the violator into compliance telephone contact with the discharger identifying the problem specifics and requesting immediate corrective measures if required more formal measures such as cease and desist orders injunctive relief or termination of the service shall be placed into effect so as to achieve compliance or eliminate the problem occurrence 4enforcement evaluation for noncompliance the violations and conditions identified during the screening processes are reviewed to make a determination relative to the nature of the violation and the type of enforcement necessary this process is accomplished by using the criteria outlined in the attached enforcement response guide 5insignificant noncompliance this process consists of notifying the industrial user by phone of the violation this call outlines the specifics of the incident and seeks remedial action and response of the discharge the insignificant noncompliance process also includes an industrys failure to report slug loading process changes and failure to send monthly selfmonitoring reports multiple insignificant violations will result in industry being deemed in significant noncompliance 6significant noncompliance this process consists of notifying the industrial user by phone and letter of violation mailed certified return receipt requested the letter of violation outlines the specifics of the incident more serious chronic types of noncompliance as set out in the attached enforcement response guide and seeks remedial action and respeaseof the discharge the city waste water departments department head department head will then evaluate the response replyto the letter of violation and make a determination as to whether the discharger has returned to compliance if compliance is not achieved the city will initiate formal enforcement action 7formal action aletter of violation when the city finds that a discharger is in violation of the admissible limits or the provisions of a major contributor permit the city may require the user to submit for approval a detailed letter within ten days of specific actions which the user shall take in order to prevent or to correct a violation binformal meeting this process consists of setting up a meeting with the industrial users plant manager and the department head and industrial coordinators to discuss the action the industry will use to bring the industrial users back into compliance an informal meeting can require a response within ten days the industry may be allowed up to six months to come into compliance with this action ccompliance schedule this schedule is necessary whenever an industrial user is not meeting their limits at the time of promulgation of that standard the schedule contains increments of progress ie hiring an engineer completing plans commencing construction completing construction and the like which corresponds to specific dates for their completion these represent milestone dates for coming into compliance the iu is usually allowed six to 12 months to comply with this action dissuance of cease and desist orders when the department head finds that a discharger is in violation of the admissible limits or the provisions of their permit he or she may issue an order to cease and desist to the industrial user and direct that the user comply with such provisions 1comply immediately  2comply with all terms of a compliance schedule as the city directs  or 3take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a threatened violation einjunction when the department head

passed 81312  am passed 71116   enforcement response guide this guide is designed to address a broad range of industrial users violations of monitoring reporting and treatment requirements that may range from relatively minor problems to very serious major violations each instance of noncompliance is considered a violation and sound enforcement policy will be to consider when determining whether a violation is significant or insignificant aduration of the violation and compliance history of the iu 1the department head will review the violation summary to evaluate the duration of the violation and the compliance history of the industrial user any exceedance of an applicable effluent limit or failure to meet the deadlines and conditions for reporting monitoring or treatment is a violation the violation summary will be reviewed for at least one quarter to determine if the particular types of violations are isolated or recur in some type of pattern the department head will also consider the enforcement response that was offered for the previous violations 2isolated violations will usually be attributed to a relatively simple problem that can be easily corrected however when several minor exceedances occur either consecutively or several months apart it may suggest that operating practices are inadequate to meet the limits and further pretreatment measures are needed 3more aggressive enforcement actions will be taken against facilities that frequently exceed numerical pretreatment standards than those that report isolated exceedances unless the isolated exceedances are large and troublesome bapparent good faith of responsible industrial user personnel if industrial user personnel appear to be attempting in good faith to comply with pretreatment requirements city enforcement actions will obviously be on a more cooperative level than if industrial user personnel do not appear to be attempting to comply 1city personnel are aware that the clean water act requires extraordinary efforts to comply with its requirements in a timely way good faith will be measured against this standard congress clearly expresses the efforts that are expected the act requires industry to take extraordinary efforts if the vital and ambitious goals of the congress are to be met this means that business as usual is not enough prompt vigorous and in many cases expensive pollution control measures must be initiated and completed as promptly as possible in assessing the good faith of a discharger the discharger is to be judged against these criteria moreover it is an established principle which applies to this act that administrative and judicial reviews are sought on the dischargers own time legislative history of the clean water act no 95 14 vol 3 p 463 cdefinition of significant noncompliance 1instances of significant noncompliance are defined as follows aviolations of wastewater discharge limits will be evaluated based on the magnitude andor frequency of the violations of average limits over a six month period these violations will be evaluated on the basis of individual parameters and monitoring locations 1technical review criteria trc athirty three percent 33% or more of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit by more than the trc in a six month period bgroup i for conventional pollutant bod tss fats oil and grease and ph trc factor   14 x parameter limitation value cgroup ii for all other pollutants trc factor   12 x parameter limitation value except ph and temperature 2chronic violations are where sixty six percent or more of the measurements exceed the same daily maximum limit or the same average limit in a six month period any magnitude of exceedance 3any other violation of an effluent limit average or daily maximum which the city believes has the potential to cause or has caused interference with the potw performance capability eg sludge loads or passes plant in unacceptable quantities eg exceeds water quality standards or impairing beneficial uses bviolations of compliance schedule milestones for planning engineering starting construction completing

pretreatment violations it is not intended to cover all types of violations the responses in this guide are suggested responses they are equally effective the measure of the effectiveness of an enforcement response includes 1whether the noncomplying source returns to compliance as expeditiously as possible 2whether the enforcement response establishes the appropriate deterrent effect for the particular violator and for other potential violators 3whether the enforcement response promotes fairness to government treatment as between comparable violators as well as between complying and noncomplying parties cthis guide has been developed for guidance and is not intended to create legal rights or obligations or to limit the enforcement discretion of the city of crawfordsville indiana

requirements of the pretreatment program and identify the volume and character of pollutants discharged by the industrial user the city of crawfordsville started their pretreatment program in the mid 1970s and has updated the program on a regular basis bthe city does have all industries with an industrial discharge permit file do an industrial pretreatment inspection report annually pretreatment personnel go over the report with the industry and do a field inspection to note any changes in the industrys process or any plant expansions the city also has minor industries file a report to verify there are no changes in their process this is done at least once annually cthe wastewater plant in crawfordsville is able to identify new sources by 1working closely with the city planner  2working with the chamber of commerce  3notified by sewer billing office of any changes in company name or noticeable change in water usage  4added name to billing list  5sewer connections or inspections

city of crawfordsville indiana and shall hereafter be referred to as this subchapter passed 3810  5341 purpose athis subchapter establishes standards for the planning and design of drainage systems and stormwater control facilities within the jurisdictional area of the city of crawfordsville the purpose of this subchapter is to control stormwater drainage facilities grading excavation clearing and other alterations of the land in order to limit the dangers of personal injury or property damage that may be caused by stormwater runoff in addition these provisions are needed to secure the eligibility for flood insurance under public law 1016 and thereby promote the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of crawfordsville bit is recognized that smaller streams and drainage channels serving the city of crawfordsville may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff as land changes from agricultural or open use to a more urbanized use it is further recognized that deposits of sediment from developments during and after construction activities can reduce capacities of storm sewer drainage systems and result in damages to the receiving water bodies therefore it shall be the policy of the city of crawfordsville that the storage and controlled release of stormwater runoff shall be required of all new development and redevelopment and other new construction in the city of crawfordsvilles jurisdiction the release rate of stormwater from developed lands shall not exceed the release rate from the land area in its present land use as further defined in  5358 cbecause topography and the availability and adequacy of outlets for stormwater runoff vary with almost every site the requirements for stormwater drainage tend to be an individual matter for any project it is recommended that each proposed project be discussed with the superintendent of stormwater for the city of crawfordsville at the earliest practical time in the planning stage passed 3810  5342 applicability this subchapter shall apply to all development that requires city of crawfordsville location permits and official review and approval of the

reduction of the requirements of this subchapter  instead the superintendent shall review each proposed project and grant a waiver or modification as set forth below bpromptly upon the filing of a building permit or other such application with the planning department and as part of the routine processing of all such applications within the city the superintendent will review the project plans and if advisable in his or her discretion perform a site inspection of the proposed project the superintendent will then complete a stormwater review and forward it to the planning department the superintendent may discuss the applicability of various provisions of this subchapter and other applicable laws and regulations with regard to the project with the city engineer the city municipal

particular impact of each project but the review shall be in writing and made available to the applicant cif as a result of initial review of the application and any consultations the superintendent determines that one or more state federal or local laws or regulations preclude waiver or modification of this subchapter or any part of it then he or she shall so notify the applicant in writing and deny the request for a waiver or modification dif as a result of the initial stormwater review the superintendent determines that the project may have an adverse impact on stormwater quantity and runoff andor on stormwater quality then the superintendent will request a preconstruction prebuilding permit approval meeting between representatives of the city and the applicant or the applicants representatives this meeting shall be scheduled in an expedient manner and may be required by the superintendent to be held onsite at or prior to this meeting the applicant should provide enough information to address the concerns of the superintendent shown in the review and if the applicant fails to address those concerns to the satisfaction of the superintendent a waiver will not be granted eif as a result of the initial stormwater review however the superintendent determines that the project will have no or de minimus impact on stormwater quantity and runoff andor on stormwater quality then the superintendent may issue a written waiver of the requirements of this subchapter however such a waiver may be revoked at any time if it is shown that the applicant or the applicants agents exceeded one or more parameters of the original building permit application submitted to the city andor did not follow the plans submitted to the superintendent for review fan applicant who believes a waiver or modification should have been granted by the superintendent may appeal the superintendents adverse decision to the stormwater board in which case the board shall review the superintendents decision and hear the arguments and review documentation from the superintendent and the applicant or their representatives and then the board may grant a waiver or modification an

does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations passed 1912  15602 findings of fact athe flood hazard areas of crawfordsville are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages passed 1912  15603 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  and fmake federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program passed 1912  15904 objectives the objectives of this chapter are ato protect human life and health  bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dto minimize prolonged business interruptions  eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and gto ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area passed 1912  15605 definitions unless specifically
