retaining walls to blend the structures into the terrain d lot lines shall be placed at the top of slope areas to help ensure that slope maintenance would not be neglected e structures should be located in the most accessible least visually prominent and most geologically stable portions of the site siting structures in the least visually prominent locations is especially important on open hillsides where the prominence of construction should be minimized by placing structures so that they would be screened by existing vegetation rock outcroppings or depressions in topography in wooded areas dispersed structures may be preferable to save trees and minimize visual impacts f structures shall be designed with the following principles in mind 1 building forms should be scaled to complement the character of the hillsides and to avoid excessively massive forms that dominate views of the hills 2 residential development on infill hillside parcels should be of a scale that is compatible with existing adjacent development and should be designed to locate windows balconies and outdoor living areas with consideration for the privacy of adjacent dwellings and yards where feasible figure 37 design sensitive to terrain 3 building facades should change plane and use overhangs as a means to create changing shadow lines to further break up massive forms 4 wall surfaces facing towards viewshed areas should be minimized use of singlestory elements setbacks roof pitches and landscaping 5 roof pitches should generally be placed to follow the angle of the slope  but variation should be provided to avoid a monotonous appearance see figure 37 6 avoid structures which are more than six 6 feet above finish grade and have visible structural underpinnings g a harmonious mixture of materials color and forms should be used to blend the structures with the natural appearance of the hillsides 1 based upon the graphic principle that dark colors are less noticeable and light colors are more noticeable darker tones including browns black greys greens and terra cotta should be used for building elevations and roof materials in viewsensitive areas  2 surface materials should be of rough texture to blend with the coarseness of landscaping and natural vegetation textured stucco wood brick and coarse block are appropriate  and 3 roof materials should be of rough texture roof colors should utilize darker tones including browns black greys greens and terra cotta bright colors should be avoided h night views of the hillsides should not be dominated by an array of bright lights lighting within viewsensitive areas should be properly shielded to avoid glare and the spill of light to surrounding areas lowlevel lighting and the use of multiple low fixtures are encouraged as opposed to the use of fewer but taller fixtures i large retaining walls in a uniform plane shall be avoided break retaining walls into elements and terraces and use landscaping to screen them from view generally no retaining wall should be higher than thirtysix 36 inches see figure 38 j the ventura county fire protection district shall review all proposed landscaping and vegetation for fire protection purposes  3 eff  hillside project development standards figure 38 retaining wall design a in order to help retain the natural features of hillsides and

its charm and enduring attraction result from the natural beauty of its unique mountain and valley location its climate and equally from the distinct character and traditions of community life established by the people who have chosen to live there the maintenance and orderly growth of this environment with emphasis upon harmonious architectural development is essential to the survival of these values the commission by city laws is charged with the responsibility of the maintenance of architectural standards which will contribute to these ends sustain property values and further the public welfare the design of the buildings most characteristic of the city has been inspired chiefly by traditional types developed under similar climatic conditions the successful adaptation of these architectural forms with ingenious variations to meet modern needs has resulted in an architectural design that identifies particularly the central business district of the city from other communities it is essential to a rational and continued improvement of the community that property owners architects and builders recognize these facts and use initiative and their best judgment and talents toward the development of buildings of character that harmonize with their surroundings and are suitable for the proposed site  3 eff  application a an application for a design review permit shall be

evaluated for adherence to the following design principles illustrated in figures 11 and 12 1 context  new structures should employ materials colors textures styles building mass and scale that are compatible with the architectural character and form of surrounding buildings as appropriate  2 continuity  buildings should be set back from the street consistent with the pattern of existing development located in the vicinity of the property  3 scale  building forms should maintain a human scale at the street and an appropriate height transition to adjacent properties  and 4 architectural design  high quality architecture should be employed to avoid monotonous building elevations and create architectural interest b all projects shall be evaluated for compliance with applicable general plan policies in particular the following 1 lu2  preserve the following physical components of ojais small town character along with the desirable features of individual neighborhoods and incorporate them into the design of new development wherever feasible a retention of a feeling of openness and preservation of views of the hills and mountains which form the ojai valley defining the extent of urban development as well as preservation of the natural character of these hillside areas b preservation of significant community monuments such as libbey park the arcade and the post office as well as the visual prominence of these features within the downtown area c an emphasis on the retention of natural landforms and the natural environment over its conversion to urban forms  and an emphasis on ease of pedestrian and bicycle access and transportation d a generally low profile form of development 2 lu10  require that new developments be at an appropriate density or intensity based upon compatibility with the majority of existing surrounding uses as part of the development review process treat the densities and intensities outlined in the land use element for specific designations as the maximum allowable and do not approve the maximum allowable density or intensity unless the proposed project is consistent with provisions of each of the elements of the ojai general plan a require that adequate buffering and transitions be provided between dissimilar uses where a question of compatibility exists require the new use to conform to the lower intensity b as part of the development review process new development or the alteration of existing development is to be viewed not only as a freestanding object but also as part of a street neighborhood and as part of the entire community c require that the bulk and massing of new structures relate to the prevailing or planned scale of adjacent development require that setbacks from sweets relate to existing setbacks along the street the scale of the structure and the desired character of the development d require that new development respect the views of existing developments  provide view corridors which are oriented toward existing or proposed community amenities such as parks open spaces and natural features c all affordable housing projects developed on property with an spl designation shall be evaluated for adherence to the following design parameters 1 building height  building heights allowed under the spl zone designation shall be treated as the maximum allowable and projects shall not be approved to the maximum allowable unless all of the requirements of are met  and 2 sitespecific considerations  all affordable housing projects proposed on property with an spl zone designation shall adhere to the sitespecific design parameters listed in table 210 d all projects shall be evaluated for adherence to the following general standards 1 all buildings shall be designed in accordance with recognized principles of architectural design and shall harmonize with or complement adjacent or nearby principal structures nearby structures which are obsolete or of no architectural importance may be disregarded 2 the overbuilding of a site shall be discouraged the provision of open areas that will permit suitable landscaping complementary to the proposed design such as front setbacks walls courts patios planters window boxes and the like are elements that will contribute substantial economic benefits to the owner and enhance the beauty of the neighborhood 3 the commission recognizes the requirements of contemporary business and society and that modern methods of construction and new materials make possible many solutions of a design consistent with these standards and the purposes of this article and the commission does not intend to restrict ingenuity provided the design is compatible with adjacent or nearby principal structures falsefront designs shall be discouraged 4 the choice of materials such as stucco or masonry walls in light tones and irregular textures with roofs of tile or other coarse material should reflect the inherent character of the building harsh boxlike forms the extensive use of glossy surfaces bright metals or strong and glaring colors are not generally consistent with the purposes of this article and will not be favorably considered 5 the design of signs and other advertising media should harmonize with and be subordinate to the building served 6 the color of the building and trim is of utmost importance in relating a building to its surroundings proper study of the color scheme will result in improved aesthetic values that will reflect true value in the property to the owner and to the community soft muted colors will receive most favorable consideration 7 buildings and structures proposed to be erected in manufacturing zones shall reflect compliance with the policies set forth in this section consistent with the limitations of the structure with due consideration of screen planting and other similar devices to improve the appearance of the property 8 the area surrounding the central

the city therefore design guidelines have been established where special emphasis has been placed on maintaining a harmonious design in keeping with and complementing the existing patterns of the central business district this does not mean the literal copying of existing styles but rather the maintenance of appropriateness and harmony in relation to the existing buildings of traditional significance in the area such buildings can still be functionally planned and be appropriate to the needs of changing times but with emphasis on the selection of materials and colors as suggested in

management plan a introduction although the federal clean air act has significantly improved our nations air quality many areas still have serious air quality problems ozone the main constituent of smog is the most serious and widespread air pollution problem in the country ozone is a colorless and highly reactive gas it is not emitted directly into the air but is formed in the lower atmosphere by chemical reactions involving reactive organic compounds roc and nitrogen oxides nox in the presence of sunlight these ozone precursor pollutants come from such varied sources as gasoline vapors fuel combustion chemical solvents and household products such as hair sprays deodorants and cleaners ozone reaches peak levels by midafternoon and along with ozone precursors is usually carried inland by sea breezes thus inland areas such as the city and the ojai valley often have the highest ozone levels and the most days which exceed the federal and state ozone standards the smoggiest days tend to occur from may smog season when stable atmospheric conditions and high temperatures produce conditions conducive to ozone formation in the united states 100000000 people live in areas that do not meet the federal clean air standards for ozone further 150000000 people live in areas not in compliance with at least one federal clean air standard ozone reacts with lung tissue irritating and inflaming the lungs it may cause chest pains shortness of breath coughing nausea throat irritation and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections scientific evidence indicates that longterm repeated exposure to ozone can permanently scar lung tissue thereby reducing breathing ability ozonesensitive groups include children athletes pregnant women the elderly and people with respiratory problems the national economic loss from air pollution is estimated to be seventyfive billion and no100ths $7500000000000 dollars per year ten to twelve 10%12% percent of our national health care costs are attributable to air pollutionrelated illness and air pollution is thought to be responsible for a two 2% percent loss in united states worker productivity air pollution also adversely affects agricultural crops nationwide ozone is thought to reduce crop yields by five to ten 5%10% percent per year costing three billion and no100ths to five billion and no100ths $300000000000$500000000000 dollars per year in california annual ozoneinduced crop damage reduces agricultural yields by up to twenty 20% percent it also damages the natural environment ecosystems and plant and animal species the county and specifically the ojai valley due to its geographical characteristics is one of the areas that has a severe ozone problem over the last ten 10 years the county averaged about thirtyfive 35 days per year over the federal ozone standard and 112 days over the more stringent state standard the citys average was four 4 and twentythree 23 days respectively during the 1970s and prior to passage of the former plan first stage smog alerts were common in the city since 198 however there have been only two 2 first stage smog alerts both alerts occurred in 1989 during unusual weather conditions air quality improvements are occurring as a result of increased emission requirements for automobiles and city and county growth management between 1990 and 200 the citys population increased by only three 3% percent although ozone levels have declined significantly in recent years the city and county still experience violations of the federal and state ozone standards as the county grows achieving and maintaining clean air will be greatly influenced by local land use decisions reducing vehicle trips and population growth generated by new development must be an important consideration in the land use planning process if air quality in the ojai valley is to continue improving the land use economic development transportation energy and environmental policies that form the foundation of local land use plans must balance future growth with the need for clean air there is no simple answer to the citys smog problem its air quality is better than it was twenty 20 years ago nevertheless air pollutants must be further reduced to bring the county and the city into compliance with federal and state clean air standards clean air is important to people people know that an area with good air quality is a better and more attractive place to live work and visit all city residents deserve clean air to breathe the city council is committed to meeting all clean air standards as soon as possible b federal clean air act the first comprehensive national air pollution legislation was the federal clean air act of 1970 in 197 the federal clean air act was amended to require plans for meeting the national clean air standards as expeditiously as practicable but no later than  however the clean air act permitted the united states environmental protection agency epa to extend the attainment date of some ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment areas to  ventura county was one of the ozone areas given an extension to  on  president george h bush signed the 1990 federal clean air act amendments caaa into law that landmark legislation which took nearly twelve 12 years to enact began a new and comprehensive effort to provide all americans with clean air central to the caaa are specific dates by which all areas of the country including the county must meet the federal clean air standards to achieve that ambitious objective the caaa contains a vast number of new requirements examples of the new requirements include specific emission reduction targets stricter motor vehicle pollution limits additional pollution limits additional pollution controls on industrial facilities less polluting vehicle fuels and new permit and compliance programs the caaa also contains economic incentive strategies to encourage industry to curtail air polluting emissions voluntarily the caaa gives the states primary responsibility for achieving federal clean air standards the state implementation plan sip is the principal mechanism at the state and local level for complying with the caaa a sip is a document that outlines the actions and programs that a state will take to carry out its clean air act responsibilities the epa approves all sips once approved a sip is legally binding under both state and federal law the aqmp is a component of the california sip under the caaa ozone areas are classified based on the severity of each areas respective ozone problem these classifications are marginal moderate serious severe and extreme marginal areas are areas closest to meeting the federal ozone standard where the countrys only extreme area the greater los angeles area has the worst ozone problem each area must not only comply with all the requirements for its own classification but also must comply with the requirements of the lower classifications unless otherwise specified for example a serious ozone area must comply with all the requirements for serious marginal and moderate areas this means that areas with more severe air quality problems have progressively more requirements to meet under the caaa also an areas ozone classification determines how long the area has to attain the federal ozone standard marginal areas have three 3 years  moderate areas six 6 years  serious areas nine 9 years  severe areas either fifteen 15 or seventeen 17 years depending on the magnitude of their respective ozone problem and the only extreme area twenty 20 years the county including the ojai valley and the city is a severe15 ozone nonattainment area meaning that they must achieve the federal one 1 hour ozone standard by 2005 the caaa also provides sanctions that the epa can and in some cases must impose on areas that fail to meet caaa requirements the caaa authorizes two 2 types of mandatory sanctions 1 withholding federal highway project funds and 2 twotoone  emission offsets for major stationary sources there are also several types of discretionary sanctions that the epa can impose such as withholding grants for air quality planning the epa may impose sanctions for 1 failure to submit an sip or a portion of an sip  2 disapproval of an sip by the epa  3 failure to carry out the provisions in an approved sip  and 4 failure to submit any provision required by the caaa if the problem is not corrected within eighteen 18 months the epa must impose one 1 of the two 2 mandatory sanctions the epa can impose both sanctions if an area fails to make a good faith effort to correct the problem on  the epa issued its final order of sanctions rule the rule stipulates that the first sanction imposed will be the twotoone  emission offset if the sanctionable deficiency is not corrected within six 6 months federal highway funds will be withheld although these sanctions would be imposed on the county which has the primary responsibility for meeting federal and state air quality standards the city is obligated to do its part to assist in that effort c federal implementation plan the 1982 aqmp did not show that the county would meet the federal ozone standard by  as mandated by the 1977 clean air act amendments in response the citizens to preserve the ojai cpo sued the epa in 1988 the lawsuit asked that the epa disapprove the 1982 aqmp impose a construction moratorium on new and modified major sources of roc emissions and prepare a federal implementation plan fip to achieve the federal ozone standard d previous planning efforts the first study of air pollution in the county occurred in 1966 that study found that the county had a serious air pollution problem citing over seventy 70 smoggy days per year consequently the ventura county air pollution control district was formed in 1968 the district the districts mission was and continues to be to protect public health and agriculture from the adverse effects of air pollution by identifying air pollution problems and developing a longrange comprehensive program to achieve and maintain state and federal air quality standards e previous aqmps the 1979 aqmp the countys first comprehensive air quality plan anticipated that the federal ozone standard would be attained by 1987 that prediction was optimistic as it soon became clear that attainment by 1987 would not occur however based upon air quality concerns the city enacted implemented the former plan the 1982 aqmp was a refinement of the 1979 aqmp that aqmp contained a more accurate emission inventory and additional emission control measures the 1982 aqmp also separated the county into two 2 air sheds the ojai valley airshed and the oxnard plain airshed the 1982 aqmp was more realistic recognizing that the federal ozone standard would not be met by the end of 1987 in early 198 the district began a comprehensive effort to update and improve the aqmp a more accurate emission inventory was developed new control measures were proposed and a new more accurate air quality model was used although the 1987 aqmp contained new control measures to further reduce ozone precursor emissions the 1987 aqmp concluded that the federal ozone standard could not be made without additional emission reductions the next county aqmp the 1991 aqmp was prepared in response to the california clean air act that aqmp built on the 1987 aqmp contained new and revised control measures designed to move the county further toward state and federal clean air standards the 1991 aqmp was adopted by the districts air pollution control board on  f 1994 aqmp the primary purpose of the county 1994 aqmp was to satisfy the planning requirements of the caaa and to outline a strategy for meeting the federal ozone clean air standard by 200 while accommodating a reasonable and inevitable amount of growth the caaa requirements addressed by the 1994 aqmp were attainment of the federal ozone standard by 200 a post1996 rateofprogress demonstration contingency measures an updated 1990 baseline emissions inventory revised 19901996 rateofprogress emissions reduction calculations and revised estimates that show that motor vehicle emissions will decrease despite increases in vehicle use the 1994 aqmp also satisfied the requirements of the california clean air act to submit a triennial progress report and revisions to the 1991 aqmp by the end of 1994 g 1995 aqmp revision the purpose of the 1995 aqmp revision was to update information presented in the 1994 aqmp to reflect changes that have occurred since the plan was adopted on  based on the emissions control strategy proposal in the 1995 aqmp revision the district projects attainment of the federal one 1 hour ozone standard in 200 as mandated by the federal clean air act recent information indicates that the countys attainment of federal one 1 hour standards for ozone by 2005 is probable however the district will not attain californias more stringent healthbased ambient ozone standard by 2005 in addition federal law has recently set a new eight 8 hour standard that will be extremely difficult for the county to attain accordingly the citys efforts to control growth in order to assist the county in meeting its clean air mandates must continue for the foreseeable future  1 eff  adoption of the county clean air july 198 the county adopted providing for a limitation on issuance of residential building permits in the ojai valley in order to protect air quality and implement the aqmp the formula used by the county for limiting building permits ensures consistency with adopted aqmp housing and population estimates and forecasts for the ojai valley including the city a housing project which would cause the city to exceed these estimates and forecasts would be determined to be inconsistent with the aqmp and therefore also determined to have a significant cumulative adverse air quality impact  1 eff  adoption of air quality element in 199 the city adopted an air quality element to its general plan the elements primary goal is to ensure a level of air quality which protects its citizens health safety and welfare and meets or surpasses state and federal air quality standards one of the elements policies in pursuing this goal is to manage the citys population growth the suggested implementing strategy for this policy is continued enforcement of city residential and commercial growth management plans  1 eff  state housing legislation during 1982 and 198 the legislature of the state adopted legislation encouraging cities to provide affordable housing opportunities to all of its citizens the impact of such legislation is as follows a a housing element is required as a component of each jurisdictions general plan by of the government to of the government the housing element shall consist of an identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs and a statement of goals policies quantified objectives and scheduled programs for the preservation improvement and development of housing the housing element must identify adequate sites for housing including rental housing factorybuilt housing and mobile homes and must make adequate provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community in addition government 1 requires the city consistent with its general plan to designate and zone sufficient vacant land to meet its projected housing needs the citys currently adopted and stateapproved housing element for years 2000 to 2005 provides programs that will enable the city to meet these needs while at the same time recognizing the necessity of this ordinance in order to address the environmental constraints on growth caused by the need to meet clean air standards b the state local housing element law requires each association of governments to determine housing needs and distribution within its region the southern california association of governments has developed a regional housing allocation model which assigns future housing unit needs for all income groups adjusted to avoid impaction for each jurisdiction this allocation of regional housing needs rhna determines housing needs that each jurisdiction must include in its housing element government a1 the housing element must include implementation measures to meet the determined housing needs the citys currently adopted housing element provides for increased housing opportunities in 20002005 within the city and progress toward the citys meeting its rhna goals the plan exempts affordable housing from its restrictions c density bonuses are generally required by government for developments which include a specified percentage ie twentyfive 25% percent of affordable housing this ordinance exempts those housing developments which meet the requirements for density bonuses d recent amendments to government 2 provide that second dwelling units must also be exempt from the provisions of any city growth management plan accordingly this ordinance exempts such units from its requirements  1 eff  enactment of plan by reason of the above set forth factors the city has determined it is necessary and appropriate to enact a residential growth management plan the plan for an additional ten 10 years  1 eff  plans objectives and purposes objectives this chapter is being promulgated in accordance with the following objectives a preserve the quality of life in the city by maintaining these qualities 1 healthy environment air water quality etc 2 natural environment habitat flora and fauna 3 small town atmosphere small scale 4 strong community identification 5 aesthetic quality 6 cultural advantages  b protect the open space of the city  c ensure the balanced economic development of the city by 1 encouraging compatible business 2 accommodating tourism but only to the extent it does not compromise other goals  d ensure adequacy of city facilities and services within budget limitations  e ensure a balance of housing types and values to accommodate a variety of families including persons of all income levels and older persons on limited fixed incomes  1 eff  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to protect the health safety and general welfare of present and future residents of the city against the adverse effects of poor air quality attributable to populationrelated emissions including construction and traffic emissions to preserve the smalltown character of the city and to protect the citys open space and quality of life while at the same time providing affordable housing opportunities  1 eff  findings findings a the city has heretofore adopted a general plan specific plans and its official zoning ordinance all of which regulate all uses of property in the city including those properties which are residentially zoned b for many years the city experienced intense rapid fluctuating residential development which adversely affected 1 local air quality  2 the capacity of the streets and local freeway system to meet traffic demands  3 the capacity of schools to provide proper uncrowded facilities for the education of children  4 the semirural character of the community  5 the quality of life prevalent in the city  6 the cost to residents of public services  7 the availability of adequate infrastructure including without limitation water sewer and utilities  8 the natural environment  and 9 public health c the city is located in a nonattainment area of the county for ozone and particulates and continues to experience days when its air contains contaminants which violate state and federal clean air standards d in 197 the former plan was approved by the city council of the city having the effect of enacting of title 10 of the ojai municipal former plan was intended to provide a steady annual residential growth rather than a fluctuating overly rapid rate of growth in order that services provided by the city the schools the public utilities and other service agencies could be properly managed so as to avoid overextending those facilities and in order to meet the requirements of the federal clean air act of 1977 e the former plan has achieved with some measure of success the purposes as described therein in that the former plan permitted a steady rate of residential growth within the city while at the same time established a method by which the citys share of regional housing stock was provided and the number of days that the citys air has exceeded state and federal air quality standards declined f the former plan expired by its own terms on  the city council has heretofore directed the city staff and its planning commission to study the question of whether a need exists to continue the type of regulation included in the former plan g the staff has prepared a study and has submitted the same to the planning commission which demonstrates that the continuation of the type of regulations set forth in the former plan is necessary for the public health safety and welfare of the city h the planning commission has conducted a public hearing on the matter and concluded that the plan is required to protect the public health safety and welfare of the city and has recommended the adoption of the same for a ten 10 year period i the planning commission concluded that the continuation of the regulations set forth in the plan which are consistent with the provisions of the citys general plan applicable specific plans and the citys zoning regulations is necessary for the public health safety and welfare of the city j it is the purpose and intent in adopting the plan to achieve a steady rather than a fluctuating overlyrapid rate of residential growth each year in order that the services provided by the city school utility andor services agencies operating in the city could properly and effectively be staged in a manner which would not overextend existing facilities that the city could protect its citizens from the effect of contaminated air and that the city could preserve its rural smalltown character k the city council has determined based upon studies and evidence presented at its public hearings that continuation of a steady controlled residential growth is still necessary for the reasons set forth above l the adoption of the plan is necessary to continue established controls over the quality distribution and rate of growth of the city in the interest of 1 preserving the character of the community  2 protecting the natural environment and open space of the city  3 protecting the public health and quality of life in the city  4 ensuring the adequacy of city facilities school facilities recreation and park facilities and other public services  5 ensuring a balance of housing types and values in the city which will accommodate a variety of families including families of low and moderate income  6 ensuring the balanced development of the city  7 preventing further significant deterioration in local air quality which in that regard the city hereby reaffirms and adopts as its own the following findings of the aqmp a there is a direct relationship between the quality of the ojai valleys air and the health safety and welfare of the ojai valley and city residents b the quality of the ojai valleys air has deteriorated to the point where it often fails to meet state and federal ambient air quality standards designed to protect health safety and welfare c failure to meet such state and federal standards in the city and county results in i aggravation of the illness of persons suffering from asthma or chronic lung disease  ii an increase in the effort of breathing for many healthy persons  iii impairment of the performance of persons engaged in strenuous activities  iv significant health care costs attributable to air quality related health problems  v air pollution damage to crops amounting to millions of dollars annually  and vi air pollution damage to habitat and sensitive species d there is a direct measurable relationship between population growth and emissions which contributes to the deterioration of air quality in the county and the city e the aqmp has i identified certain reasonably available control measures for the control of emissions in the ojai valley  ii established the maximum rate of population increase which can be accommodated therein a assuming the implementation of all such reasonably available control measures  and b without precluding ultimate compliance within such area with the state and federal ambient air quality standards f regulation of population growth in the ojai valley in accordance with the aqmp in addition to the implementation of all other reasonably available control measures for the control of emissions is necessary in order to ensure compliance with federal ambient air quality standards and to protect adequately the public health safety and welfare 8 ensuring that the traffic demands do not exceed the capacity of streets  9 ensuring that the city does not grow in a pattern that places a severe strain on state highway 33  10 ensuring the adequacy of fire protection  11 ensuring adequate water and sanitary sewer systems m the provisions of this chapter will augment and implement the goals and policies of the city as set forth in the citys general plan and city ordinances relating to the regulation of residential development n the enactment of this chapter will permit the city to control the rate distribution quality and economic level of proposed residential development on a yeartoyear basis and ensure compliance with the aqmp o the city council based upon the evidence presented has determined that the citys appropriate share of the regional housing need equals 209 residential units of which 115 should be housing available to low and moderate income families and that the plan will not impact the citys ability to accommodate its share of the regional housing need and therefore will not affect the supply of housing in the region p the specific housing programs and activities which are described in the citys housing element are consistent with the provisions of the plan and these programs and activities will continue after the enactment of this chapter the plan exempts from its provisions projects intended for low and moderateincome families as well as those intended for seniors and the disabled and therefore will have no impact on these types of housing and will in fact encourage the provision of housing for these groups q the city has the necessary fiscal and environmental resources available to it to provide the services and necessary infrastructure to serve the steady annual increase in housing as contemplated by the provisions of the plan r based upon evidence presented at public hearings including the studies presented to it by the staff and the planning commission and each member of the city council being thoroughly familiar with the problems which arise out of rapid uncontrolled growth in any city and being aware that the city must meet certain obligations with respect to regional housing needs and in particular the provision of low and moderate income housing the city council as required by the provisions of government 6 has determined that the adoption of the plan is necessary for the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city s the plan is a project for purposes of the california environmental quality act ceqa as such the planning commission did review the initial study prepared for the plan as well as the negative declaration which is the environmental document recommended for the plan by the initial study the planning commission has certified that the negative declaration complies with the provisions of ceqa and has recommended to the city council that it adopt the negative declaration t the city council has read and considered the initial study for the plan the city council does hereby find that the plan could not have a significant effect on the physical environment because 1 no specific development is envisioned by the plan  2 there would be no direct activity which could result in the demand for new or expanded public utilities facilities and services  and 3 the plan will restrict growth which will have the effect of decreasing the potential future demand on existing public utilities facilities and services u the city council has read and considered the negative declaration prepared for the plan and does hereby find and certify that the negative declaration has been prepared in full compliance with the provisions and requirements of ceqa  1 eff
