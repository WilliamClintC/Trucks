septic systems  15644  article iv costs and charges  payment assistance adopted 1241995  15645 purpose the purpose of this article is to authorize the farmington water pollution control authority wpca to assist a property owner with limited income in paying for costs arising from constructing a sewer line and in certain instances where a water line has been constructed in conjunction with a sewer line a water line from the property line to the property owners home and related costs by having the town pay for such costs adding such costs to the amount of the owners sewer assessment or connection charge with the total amount to be paid with interest in installments approved by the wpca  15646 background the construction and use of sewer lines results in a substantial sewer assessment or connection charge being levied against property owners benefiting from such construction or use the payment of the assessment or connection charge amount is made easier by the wpca permitting such payment to be made by installments over a period of years the sewer assessment or connection charge at present does not cover the cost of constructing the sewer line from the property line to the property owners residence and related costs these are additional substantial costs borne entirely by the property owner in certain instances with property owners having limited income having to pay these additional costs in one lump sum in addition to the sewer assessment or connection charge installment payment may impose a hardship upon such property owners such hardship can be significantly alleviated by having the town pay a contractor for running the sewer line and in certain instances where a water line has been constructed in conjunction with a sewer line a water line from the property line to the property owners residence and related costs and adding such costs to the amount of the sewer assessment or connection charge to be paid with interest in installments  15647 authorization the wpca is authorized in instances where a property owners gross annual income is within the limits established in  15648 below to pay the costs of laying a sewer line and in the instances referred to above a water line from the property line to the property owners residence and related costs and to add such costs to the amount of the property owners sewer assessment or connection charge and to permit the combined amount to be paid with interest in installments over the period of years established by the wpca for payment of sewer assessment or connection charges  15645 septic systems  15648   15648 standards in order for a property owner to be eligible for assistance under this article the gross annual income of the property owner shall not exceed 150% of the median family income for the hartford area as determined annually by the united states department of housing and urban development or its successor  15648 farmington code  15648  article v residential assessments and sewer costs adopted 5112010  15649 benefit assessment methods for properties zoned for residential use a the following table provides the maximum benefit assessments to be paid by benefiting property owners of property zoned for residential use within the town of farmington  provided however the assessment amounts contained in the table shall be updated annually by the authority during its budget process using the construction cost index set forth in the latest edition of the engineering news record enr 2010 calendar year assessment amounts zoning class assessment amount r20 and under $10000 r30 and r40 $12500 r80 $15000 b when a property owner who deferred his sewer benefit assessment requests connection or is required to connect to a public sewer system or when persons independently connect to a developerconstructed sewer or when the owner of a newly created lot seeks to connect to a public sewer system for which an assessment has not previously been set the amount of the sanitary sewer connection charge for the connection shall be determined by converting the original assessment rate for that sewer to present value using the construction cost index set forth by the latest edition of the engineering news record enr c in accordance with general statutes  7249 the maximum amount that the authority shall assess a benefiting property owner shall be the lesser amount of either the assessment amount as determined by the above table or the net project cost after deduction of grants and reimbursements divided by the number of benefiting property owners  15650 sewer cost responsibilities a the intent of this section is to provide a guideline for the determination of the responsibility for the payment of the costs related to a
