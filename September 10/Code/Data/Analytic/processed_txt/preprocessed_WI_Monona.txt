the previous monona zoning a specification ordinance with rigid lists of permitted conditional and prohibited uses for each district for all districts there were regulations to specify the exact minimum lot and yard dimensions building heights and setbacks and open space requirements complicated procedures were required to obtain permission for minor variances from the regulations yet the regulations were unsuccessful in preventing development which was unattractive environmentally unsound and incompatible with the needs of the community b performance zoning substitutes sensible judgment and efficient administration for rigid regulations the intent of this performance zoning code is to regulate development according to flexible standards with individual review of each development proposal proposed developments are to be judged on the basis of their compatibility with the land the environment surrounding uses the goals of the comprehensive plan general use and site performance standards and specific district performance standards c monona is a landlocked community since monona is almost fully developed it is crucial that the development of its remaining vacant land be carefully regulated to meet the communitys needs for services a diversity of housing economic growth jobs convenient to employees homes and an improved environmental and aesthetic quality monona faces the conditions of scarce land and an impending shift from the rapid development of raw land to a slower process of redevelopment of existing uses under these circumstances maintenance of the quality of life in monona requires individual project review according to performance standards instead of specification standards which were more appropriate when monona was less developed and more rapidly growing d in many cases the specification zoning previously used in monona obstructed creative and desirable development because the zoning regulations were too rigid and arbitrary and because any deviation from these regulations required cumbersome administrative and governmental procedures this performance zoning code is designed to be more flexible and to use more efficient administrative and governmental procedures in order to avoid delays in processing development applications this chapter establishes strict time limits for the review process in order to ensure administrative fairness this chapter requires that decisions of the reviewing agency be put in writing and be based only on how the evidence presented to it for review meets the standards set by this

water tower sites the citys water towers represent a large public investment in water pressure stabilization and peak capacity reserves protection of the quality of the citys water supply is of prime importance to the city and the health and welfare of its citizens as access to the citys water storage systems increases so too increases the potential for contamination of the public water supply for these reasons the placement of wireless telecommunications antennas or towers on the water tower sites will be allowed only when the city is fully satisfied the following requirements are met a the applicants access to the facility will not increase the risks of contamination to the citys water supply b there is sufficient room on the structure andor on the grounds to accommodate the applicants facility c the presence of the facility will not increase the water tower or reservoir maintenance costs to the city d the presence of the facility will not be harmful to the health of workers maintaining the water tower 2 parks the presence of certain wireless telecommunications antennas or towers represents a potential conflict with the purposes of cityowned parks wireless telecommunications antennas or towers will be considered in cityowned parks and land zoned p  public facilities only after the recommendation of the 311 editors note original subsection f prohibition

andor communications tower andor related facility so as to reasonably accommodate colocation of two additional antenna arrays or related equipment similar in size and function to that placed on the tower or site by the applicant colocation sites need not be available on the tower or site as initially placed or constructed provided that the tower or site will support at the specified height the later addition of the required number of colocation sites the holder of a permit under this section shall make the colocation sites required hereunder available for the placement of technologically compatible antenna arrays and related equipment upon contractual provisions which are standard in the industry and at prevailing market rates allowing the permit holder to recoup the cost of providing the colocation sites and a fair return on investment312 j modification of antenna array or tower unless otherwise provided herein a conditional use permit is required for any modification of an

occur only after coordinated advance site planning to retain the unique character of these tracts and to strike an acceptable balance between natural preservation growth and development 2 for each tract development shall occur according to a largescale plan rather than on a piecemeal basis it is intended that this plan be a mutual product of efforts of the property owner and the city this could be implemented by a policy resolution of the plan commission to accept the owners general development plan for the tract or it could be implemented by a mutual decision by the  48029 monona code
