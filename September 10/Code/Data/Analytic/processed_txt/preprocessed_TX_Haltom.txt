extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control

384938100  reserved article v  flood mitigation plan introduction the city has initiated preparation of this flood mitigation plan fmp as part of its ongoing effort to provide the citizens of the city with the best possible flood protection with passage of the national flood insurance reform act of 199 congress authorized the federal emergency management agency fema to establish a federal program for providing financial assistance to states and communities for flood mitigation planning and project activities this program the flood mitigation assistance program includes preparation of a fmp as part of the process of identifying appropriate flood mitigation projects the plan includes an evaluation of existing flood hazards review of existing floodplain management activities and a plan of action for upgrading or improving floodplain management where necessary the city of haltom city population 39000 is nestled in the heart of the dallasfort worth metroplex it is bounded by fort worth on the south west and north and by watauga north richland hills and richland hills on the north and east haltom city is depicted on firm map panels 282 284 285 295 301 and 303 of the tarrant county maps fema records indicate that 243 structures in haltom city are covered by flood insurance the city is impacted primarily by two streams that traverse the city big fossil creek generally runs along the eastern part of the city while little fossil creek traverses the southwest corner of the city most significant flooding problems are associated with these streams and their tributaries the city has taken steps in recent years to address the most significant of these efforts with the corps of engineers and with neighboring cities one of the most significant flooding problems within the city involves flooding of mobile homes in the skyline mobile home park situated west of denton highway us 377 on whites branch a tributary of big fossil creek in the northern portion of the city consideration of this area will be a key component of this analysis a flood damage prevention ordinance and a comprehensive subdivision ordinance are used to guide new development in such a manner as to minimize increased flooding risks due to new development development of the flood mitigation plan is expected to result in increased efforts to address flooding conditions within the city the city staff and elected leaders are receptive to the implementation of new tools that will result in reduced exposure to flood hazards  1 exh a 51302 plan preparation process preparation of the fmp is primarily a joint effort between the consultant teague nall and perkins inc and the city engineer input and information has been solicited throughout the planning process from a number of sources including the citys staff the public other agencies involved in floodplain management the planning and zoning commission and the city council the following is an outline of the planning process 1 compilation of existing data the city has already developed several documents that are directly related to the preparation of the fmp they include a flood damage prevention ordinance and the subdivision ordinance firm maps were obtained and reviewed along with city topographic maps the city staff provided input in an interview format based on their experience in haltom city in severe weather conditions discussion included known drainage problems as well as any regulatory and operational floodplain management measures currently being implemented by the city 2 notification of other floodplain management agencies early in the planning process the following agencies have been notified of the intent of the city to develop a flood mitigation plan they have been offered the opportunity to make any suggestions or provide any input they may have related to floodplain management in the city tarrant county transportation and public works dept 100 e weatherford fort worth tx

and soliciting information and feedback especially related to existing flooding problems points of contact have been provided for interested citizens to call or write with suggestions existing flooding information or for further information mr gregory van nieuwenhuize the city engineer and floodplain administrator was identified as a point of contact along with gary l vickery of teague nall and perkins inc a copy of this advertisement is attached a public notice was also placed in the startelegram with similar information a copy of this notice is attached as well in addition on  a public meeting was held at the haltom city public library to provide information to citizens and to provide them an opportunity to have input into the planning process a notice of this public meeting was placed in the augustseptember 2001 issue of the proud and progressive newsletter as well as an advertisement in the northeast tarrant county edition of the startelegram citizens were briefed on the flood mitigation plan were updated on the status of several drainage related issues pertinent to them including the bond election scheduled for nov 6 and were given an opportunity to provide input into the process citizens shared information regarding known areas of flooding as well as commented on existing floodplain management practices particularly their perception of the lack of drainage maintenance a number of citizens took the opportunity to ask about the little fossil creek project and the upcoming bond election finally prior to approval of the plan by the city council a public hearing was held on  during which citizens were afforded an opportunity to provide input and comment the local public access cable channel televised the public hearing as part of a regular city council meeting in addition cbs channel 11 and nbc channel 5 aired a portion of the public hearing as a followup to a recent story about flooding in the skyline mobile home park in order to advise citizens of the public hearing notices will be placed in the proud and progressive newsletter the citys local cable television channel and on the city of haltom city web site 4 analysis of existing problems and preparation of a draft fmp using input and information from the sources outlined above an evaluation of existing flooding hazards and problems was undertaken these were evaluated to assess their effectiveness and numerous other possible activities have been considered from the list of existing and potential mitigation activities a draft plan has been developed 5 review of draft fmp by city staff the draft fmp has been reviewed by the city staff including the city engineer public works director and the city manager in addition a copy of the draft plan has been made available for public review and comment 6 revisions to draft plan based on comments by the staff the public and the city council the draft fmp has been revised to its present form 7 review and adoption of the fmp by city council the fmp was presented to the city council on  in a public hearing the fmp was approved by the city council on  8 implementation of plan by city staff implementation of the fmp will be primarily the responsibility of the citys engineering department  1 exh a 51302 evaluation of existing hazards significant flooding in the city occurs primarily along the major streams specifically in two locations review of the firm maps indicates that a significant portion of southeastern haltom city along little fossil creek is inundated in a 100year storm nearly 400 acres more than 20 blocks are affected by this flooding some of it to a depth of three feet or more this entire area is highly developed primarily with residential and industrial development it appears likely that this flooding is the result of several conditions first the presence of backwater from the west fork of the trinity river located in the city of fort worth southeast of the city of haltom city is a likely culprit second it appears that there is not an adequate means of conveying floodwater under state highway 121 especially with the high tailwater conditions described above while the 100year flood significantly impacts this area street flooding and property damage have been reported in more frequent storms as well dozens of buildings are situated within the floodplain in this area in addition to the obvious property damage potential when flooding occurs and the danger to the health and safety of the public there is an economic impact as well undeveloped property that is situated within the floodplain cannot be developed without meeting strict guidelines for raising the proposed structures above the 100year flood elevation or providing costly floodproofing measures existing structures within the floodplain cannot undergo substantial remodeling or reconstruction without meeting floodproofing requirements the economic result of these potential flooding conditions is that areas of the community within the floodplain face significantly limited prospects for development or redevelopment the potential for redevelopment is a key to maintaining a healthy business and residential environment in this area of the city the second major area of flooding occurs along whites branch a tributary of big fossil creek just west of denton highway us 377 in northern haltom city a large portion of the skyline mobile home park is inundated by the 100year rain event a number of mobile homes are located within the floodplain and several are situated in the actual floodway a sharp bend in whites branch near the end of piper street causes water overflowing the banks of the stream to tend to run directly into the street flooding has been frequent enough in the mobile home park that fire department personnel monitor the area when moderate to heavy rainfall occurs on several occasions rescues have been necessary to remove residents from the mobile homes as the floodwaters rise the most recent occasions took place in march 199 and again in march 2002 these rescues have been made in dump trucks which are heavy enough to avoid being swept away as well as small boats in addition to endangering the citizens the rescuers themselves are also endangered by the high water while the 100year storm leaves the banks of big fossil creek in a number of locations it appears from the firm maps that many of the structures adjacent to the stream are elevated sufficiently to prevent flood damage input received from citizens at the public meetings touched on a number of issues ranging from little fossil creek to local flooding and drainage maintenance at the  public meeting in the library citizens expressed their concerns regarding flooding at the following locations 1 orval court area near little fossil creek  2 dunson drive near shipp drive  3 mclean road at old denton road  and 4 cedarcrest drive at denton highway us 377 additionally at this public meeting several citizens had questions and comments regarding the citys little fossil creek project specifically these citizens expressed their concerns regarding the areas around orval court and thomas road at the  public hearing during the city council meeting citizens expressed their concerns regarding flooding in the following areas of the city 1 skyline mobile home park  2 the solona circle area  3 the 6000 and 6100 blocks of mccullar road  4 eastridge drive at little fossil creek  5 thomas road at little fossil creek  6 the 3200 blocks of rita lane jane lane and meadow oaks drive  7 midway road area immediately south of the solona circle area  8 the 2700 block of haley avenue  9 the 3200 block of fincher road near little fossil creek  and 10 the area along the north bank of big fossil creek immediately south of the fossil beach addition phase iii additionally during this public hearing a few citizens had questions and comments about the little fossil creek project again near orval court and thomas road at both the public meeting and the public hearing citizens also suggested increased maintenance of drainage channels and streams and removal of debris at culverts  1 exh a 51302 plan goals it is the intent of the city to develop a comprehensive floodplain management program using existing studies and data and updating procedures where necessary the following excerpt from the flood damage prevention ordinance summarizes well the aim of the city in developing a flood mitigation plan c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as bridges electric cables gas mains sanitary sewer mainssystems streets storm sewer structures telephone cableslines television cables and water mainssystems located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  1 exh a 51302 evaluation of existing floodplain management program the city is engaged in a number of floodplain management activities in keeping with the regulations of the nfip the following is a summary of these activities 1 nfip participation the city is a participant in the national flood insurance program as such regulations have been adopted for regulation of the floodplain as listed below 2 development regulation a floodplain development permit process has been incorporated into the flood damage prevention ordinance requiring submittal of plans and other information pertinent to evaluation of the impacts of development on the floodplain these materials are submitted to the floodplain administrator for review and approval all new residential structures must be constructed so that the lowest floor is elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation all new commercial industrial or other nonresidential structures must be constructed so that the lowest floor is at least one foot above the base flood elevation or be designed to be floodproofed to at least one foot above the base flood elevation manufactured homes may not be placed within the floodway manufactured homes placed within the floodplain but outside the floodway must be elevated such that the lowest floor is at least one foot above the base flood elevation and securely anchored to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement manufactured homes to be placed within an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be elevated such that the lowest floor is at least one foot above the base flood elevation and securely anchored to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement or be supported on reinforced piers to an elevation at least three feet above grade and securely anchored to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement as required by the nfip no encroachments in the floodway are permitted that would result in any rise in the base flood elevation unless a conditional letter of map revision clomr is applied for and approved by fema in addition the city does not permit floodplain modifications that would remove property from a special flood hazard area until a clomr is applied for and approved by fema in either case the city requires the developer to obtain a lomr after construction is complete 4 elevation certificates the floodplain administrator maintains a file of elevation certificates as they are made available while the file is not likely complete any new elevation certificates that the city is able to obtain are placed in this file 5 little fossil creek the city is working with the corps of engineers to develop plans for improvements to little fossil creek the target is to contain the 100year flows within the improved channel from state highway 121 to midway road these improvements will virtually eliminate the existing flood hazard in this area of the city as described earlier in this report the proposed approach was presented to citizens at a public meeting on  a bond election was presented to the voters on  to fund this and other projects because the bond election passed the corps of engineers will proceed with their study followed by design and rightofway acquisition it is currently estimated that construction will begin in the summer of 2005 6 big fossil creek the city is currently participating in a consortium of local communities to study big fossil creek and determine the improvements necessary to alleviate flooding along big fossil creek on a regionwide basis because many of the communities along big fossil creek are relatively small and the watershed encompasses many communities this approach will ensure a more cohesive longterm plan for addressing flooding conditions along big fossil creek this participation in the consortium is a positive step toward a regional solution while there appear to be few significant flooding issues along big fossil creek itself within haltom city there are a number of locations where there are significant erosion problems 7 drainage maintenance program the city currently engages in a limited drainage maintenance program primarily it consists of vegetation management by means of an annual contract to spray herbicides as necessary to keep onerous vegetation in check and maintain the flood carrying capacity of the channels in addition the city street department staff does limited clearing of culverts and streams primarily in response to citizen requests  1 exh a 51302 evaluation of potential remedies a number of possible activities could be implemented by the city to provide to its citizens increased flood protection some of these are discussed below these activities are in addition to those already in place as described above 1 upgrade regulation of new development detention several changes could be made to existing development regulations to provide increased flood protection such changes could include a requirement that all new developments provide detention to maintain postdevelopment runoff to predevelopment levels this requirement would help to prevent potential increases in flood hazards downstream of the development while a detention requirement would impose a cost to developers which would then be passed on to consumers it would not impose a significant new cost to the city however aerial photographs show that haltom city is largely built out except for the northern portion of the city detention would have little or no impact on peak flows on the major streams it is conceivable that detention could have a positive impact on some existing developments downstream of the undeveloped area but upstream of the major streams however this would be somewhat limited 2 elevation based on full development another regulation gaining widespread acceptance is to require that new construction be elevated at least one foot or even more above the 100year water surface elevation based on fully developed watershed conditions rather than existing conditions as regulated by fema this requirement primarily benefits the users of the new development in that these users are provided a greater degree of protection from possible increases in water surface due to future development this regulation would only benefit the users in such new construction but would come at virtually no cost to the existing residents andor businesses in the city and could prevent problems in the future one obstacle to such a policy however is the need to prepare hydrologic models to establish the fully developed conditions water surface elevations given the size of the watersheds for big fossil creek and little fossil creek extending far beyond the city limits of the city these studies would likely be quite involved and expensive there is a strong likelihood that these studies could be incorporated into work being done by the corps of engineers little fossil creek and the consortium big fossil creek on smaller streams and tributaries these models could be required of developers as part of the development process 3 prohibit floodplain development still another regulation being enacted in other cities is to prohibit all new development in the floodplain a naturally functioning floodplain can have many benefits to a community including the storage and conveyance of floodwaters the recharging of groundwater the maintenance of surface water quality the provision of habitat for both plant and animal wildlife as well as providing recreational opportunities and scenic value new construction or development within any floodplain can be considered to have a negative effect on flood conveyance capacity in addition because floodplains frequently provide habitat for both wildlife and plant species such development decreases the available habitat development regulations that completely prohibit new development in the floodplain can serve to provide many of the benefits derived by the community from a naturally functioning floodplain floodwater conveyance capacity can be preserved eliminating the creation of potential new flooding risks in addition to reducing the loss of life and property preservation of the floodplain can also protect critical natural and cultural resources and provide a source of community pride and identity this approach attempts to change the behavior of people rather than trying to change the behavior of a stream system rather than trying to control floodwaters these communities are encouraging people to avoid development in flood hazard areas however because haltom city is nearly built out because it is so urbanized and because such a restrictive policy has been considered by some to be a taking of property by the city this policy may not be appropriate for haltom city this approach could be considered relatively radical and introduces some controversial legal issues in municipalities where this type of policy is being employed zoning and other concessions are generally offered to developers to make the policy more defensible while such a policy may be the best approach to development from an environmental and hydrologic perspective it can be a legally and politically difficult policy to support 4 public education program the city may find that an ongoing public education program could benefit its citizens and make them better prepared for flood related emergencies regular articles in the citys bimonthly newsletter the proud and progressive could be used to provide information regarding flood protection and emergency procedures these articles would probably be most effective during the spring and fall rainy seasons in addition these articles could be used to encourage property owners to purchase flood insurance according to fema records there are currently 243 flood insurance policies in force within the city review of firm maps indicates that there are approximately 950 insurable structures within the floodplain as it exists today continued development upstream of the city can be expected to generate increased runoff and higher water surface elevations as a result it is entirely possible that additional structures will be affected by potential flooding in the future the official web site of the city would also be a good place to post floodplain information important to citizens this activity will require input and effort from the floodplain administrator andor a staff member but given the amount of material available from fema and the publication schedule bimonthly it would not need to be extensive while little direct costs would be involved unless a consultant is used to provide the educational materials it will increase the workload of the existing staff 5 participate in the crs program the community rating system crs is a program that was implemented in 1990 as part of the national flood insurance program nfip to recognize and encourage community floodplain management activities that exceed the minimum nfip standards the national flood insurance reform act of 1994 codified the community rating system in the nfip under the crs flood insurance premium rates are lowered to reflect the reduced flood risk resulting from community activities that meet the three goals of the crs 1 reduce flood losses  2 facilitate accurate insurance rating  and 3 promote the awareness of flood insurance the crs recognizes 18 creditable activities organized under four categories numbered 300 public information mapping and regulations flood damage reduction and flood preparedness specific guidelines are used to accumulate credit points which are then used to classify the entire community there are ten crs classes class 1 requires the most credit points and gives the largest flood insurance premium reduction  class 10 receives no premium reduction fema provides volumes of guidelines for establishing the crs in the local community a quick review of the creditable activities indicates that it may be possible for the city to qualify for the crs without making substantial expenditures or changes in existing programs and procedures for example any of the possible development regulations listed above would earn credits under the crs in addition certain activities currently in place would earn credits such as maintaining a record of elevation certificates other current activities could earn credits as well with some modification of the activity for example a regular program of inspecting and maintaining the drainage system can earn significant credits the program does require some relatively significant documentation of activities which must be weighed against the benefits of the program for example program documentation will occupy additional staff time as will responding to citizen inquiries and implementing an outreach program participation in the crs program is entirely voluntary while reduced flood insurance premiums for citizens are probably the most tangible reward of the crs program the activities required by the program will generally result in a bettereducated community that is better prepared to minimize flood damage in addition to reducing insurance premiums the result of participation in the program generally is to actually reduce the communitys exposure to flood damage 6 structural improvements there are two significant areas in the city that experience flooding as indicated in the foregoing evaluation of existing flood hazards the first of these is the area in the southeastern portion of haltom city along little fossil creek a remedy for this flooding situation is already underway as a result of the impacts of the flooding described in the evaluation section of this fmp the city is working with the us army corps of engineers to prepare construction plans designed to contain the 100year flows within an improved channel from state highway 121 to belknap street in addition as identified by citizens at the public meetings there are other locations in the city where culvert or storm drain improvements may be needed prior to undertaking a program that includes drainage structure improvements it is recommended that a drainage master plan be developed to identify and prioritize the necessary improvements a drainage master plan is also a possible vehicle for establishing fully developed watershed water surface elevations for establishing minimum finish floor elevations 7 expand drainage maintenance program the public works department currently undertakes a limited level of drainage maintenance as is typical in many municipalities the drainage maintenance program is limited primarily by financial constraints an expanded drainage maintenance program including clearing and removal of trees downed branches weeds and other vegetation as well as dredging and repair of erosion problems could be developed such a program would help maintain the drainage capacity of streams and channels 8 purchase highrisk properties as described in the evaluation of existing flood hazards the second major area of flooding occurs along whites branch a tributary of big fossil creek just west of denton highway us 377 in northern haltom city the extent of this hazard at the skyline mobile home park is detailed in that section of this report several alternative remedies have been considered for this area the first is structural improvements to the channel itself however a review of the flood insurance study profiles and the firm map show that whites branch is controlled by the backwater from big fossil creek all the way north to the mobile home park obviously structural improvements to whites branch would have little affect on the water surface elevations without significant structural improvements to big fossil creek as well in fact it appears from the firm maps that the constraint on big fossil creek is a major highly active railroad crossing just west of denton highway us 377 while the railroad crossing does not appear to be inundated on the firm map there is a drop of 11 in the 100year water surface elevation across the structure the cost of upgrading this railroad crossing to reduce this head loss would be significant in addition because the backwater effect from big fossil creek ends in the vicinity of the mobile home park it is likely that even with improvements to the railroad crossing at big fossil creek that structural improvements to whites branch would also be necessary because of the hazard in the skyline mobile home park described previously to property citizens and emergency response personnel and because of the likelihood of recurring problems in this area it is likely that the most cost effective solution is for the city to purchase the lots subject to flooding in order to completely eliminate the threat of flood damage clearly the hazard to the residents of skyline mobile home park as well as to emergency response personnel renders a no action alternative unacceptable in addition to the skyline mobile home park fema has identified a total of 12 repetitive loss structures in the city at least one of these structures is situated in the regulatory floodway and may be a good candidate for buyout another location will be removed from the floodplain by the proposed little fossil creek improvements project it is expected that the project will also eliminate or at least reduce the risk of future losses at that particular location several other repetitive loss structures appear to be isolated from the floodplain and may be experiencing damage from local drainage conditions rather than stream flooding development of a drainage master plan would identify the cause and possible solutions for the repeated losses experienced at these locations 9 funding considerations a number of the possible mitigation activities addressed above will require the city to incur additional costs it is important to consider funding possibilities if an action plan is to be developed the following items could be considered as possible funding sources a property tax increase one obvious means of financing flood mitigation and drainage related activities is general budget of the city this would require either raising tax revenues or cutting other budgets or both generally citizens are resistant to such measures and politically raising taxes can be difficult to support b drainage impact fee a drainage impact fee is assessed against new developments to recover the cost to upgrade drainage facilities in order to accommodate such new development funds generated by this method may only be applied to the cost of additional facilities necessary due to the new development existing drainage problems may not be addressed with impact fees because haltom city is nearly built out drainage impact fees would not likely generate sufficient funds to make significant drainage improvements without having a serious negative affect on future development however a drainage impact fee has not at this time been ruled out as a possible means of funding drainage improvements c stormwater utility fee a stormwater utility fee is essentially a user fee and is a means of funding drainage projects that is rapidly gaining in popularity the stormwater utility fee is based on the premise that all residents and businesses in the city contribute runoff to the public drainage system users of the system should contribute to the development and operation of the drainage system to the same degree that they contribute runoff to the system fees are generally collected with the monthly water bill rate schedules can be simple with one fee for residential properties and another fee for commercial and business properties rate schedules can also be more complex based on the acreage and land use of the property commonly the rate schedules are a combination of the two extremes using a single set fee for residential land uses and a graduated or demand based fee for nonresidential land uses unlike a general tax the money generated by the stormwater utility fee is dedicated to drainage infrastructure use as a result there is greater accountability for the use of the funds generated and often the residents have a clearer understanding regarding the need for these funds the generation of regular income dedicated to drainage and flood mitigation issues allows the city to implement a planned program of drainage and flood mitigation activities or this income can provide a revenue stream to finance a bond issue for more expensive construction projects with the proper public support a stormwater utility fee can be a key to making an effective action plan possible strong consideration should be given to this means of funding drainage improvements and flood mitigation activities  1 exh a 51302 action plan based on the foregoing evaluation the city proposes to implement an action plan consisting of the activities identified below along with a summary of how these activities will be carried out many of these action items are contingent upon the development approval and implementation of a stormwater utility fee this funding vehicle will likely be considered by the city council during the coming year 1 upgrade floodplain regulations affecting new development floodplain management regulations will be revised to require minimum finish floor elevations to be set at one foot above the 100year water surface elevation based on fully developed watershed conditions or twofeet above the regulatory floodplain elevation based on existing conditions this item is contingent upon either including the necessary analysis in a drainage master plan or finding access to the necessary data from outside sources such as the corps of engineers in addition the floodplain management regulations will be revised to require new developments to provide detention on all lots that are larger than three acres these developments will be required to limit stormwater runoff from the site to predevelopment levels surface detention in parking lots will be permitted subject to safety limitations on the allowable depth of ponding 2 develop a public education program the public works department will begin to prepare educational materials for publication in the proud and progressive newsletter at least two times each year these materials will encourage citizens to obtain floodplain insurance will show citizens how to determine whether or not they are in the floodplain how to respond to potential flooding conditions and will provide other floodrelated information of value to citizens in addition the official city website will have floodplain and flood insurance related links added because the newsletter is already published the only cost is that cost necessary to prepare educational articles for the newsletter and web site this could be done by city staff at the expense of other activities or by an outside consultant given the availability of information from fema the time andor cost should be minimal 3 structural improvements by far the most important of the structural improvements currently being considered is the little fossil creek project proposed by the corps of engineers now that the voters have passed the bond election the corps will proceed with the necessary study rightofway acquisition and construction plans even with the construction of the improvements authorized by the approval of the bond election other structural improvements are likely to be needed there are at least two alternatives for determining what improvements are needed and what priority they have the most comprehensive means which will likely prove to be the most costeffective in the long run is to develop a drainage master plan this plan will include an evaluation of existing drainage facilities an assessment of needed improvements determination of construction cost and a determination of priority of the proposed improvements potential drainage improvement projects can be prioritized in a relatively objective manner providing the city council and staff with a powerful tool for selecting improvement projects to be constructed however the initial cost of preparation of a drainage master plan can be very expensive this is because it is necessary to inventory all existing drainage facilities analyze these facilities identify deficiencies and evaluate possible improvements it is entirely possible that the cost for developing a drainage master plan could be as high as $20000000 to $30000000 preparation of a drainage master plan is probably contingent on implementation of a stormwater utility fee identifying and prioritizing the needed drainage projects can also be accomplished in a less systematic way by simply responding to drainage problems observed by staff and citizens this procedure is inherently reactive and unfocused and has the potential to put the public works staff in a difficult position from time to time however due to funding andor staffing limitations many communities deal with drainage problems in exactly this manner it is unlikely that any significant cost could be attributed to this means of identifying drainage problems clearly though staff and council must be willing to address drainage problems on an individual basis often with unhappy citizens 4 expand drainage maintenance program expansion of the existing drainage maintenance program could entail hiring of additional staff and possibly acquisition of additional equipment depending on the level of maintenance to be provided however it is highly unlikely that a crew could be dedicated to drainage maintenance an alternative would be to use existing street department staff to provide some limited drainage maintenance or to contract out such work from time to time the most effective drainage maintenance would likely involve clearing of debris caught at bridges and culverts and possibly occasional dredging of silt and sediment in streams and channels minimal equipment would be needed for such a crew this equipment would probably consist of chainsaws a backhoe and trailer and a dump truck generally speaking this work would require a threeman crew however rather than hiring additional workers and purchasing or leasing equipment this additional maintenance could be handled by existing staff on an asneeded basis or be work that is dedicated for two or three days a month during dry weather while using existing staff would not entail additional cost assuming the necessary equipment is already available it must be considered that this work will take the place of work that staff is now doing in other words while the additional expense to expand the drainage maintenance program may be kept quite low there may be a corresponding sacrifice to existing services in either case significant expansion of the drainage maintenance program is contingent upon implementation of a stormwater utility fee 5 purchase highrisk properties several properties are candidates for purchase in haltom city as described in the evaluation of potential remedies section of this report a total of 133 lots in the skyline mobile home park are within the 100year floodplain of which 27 are in the regulatory floodway all of these but particularly those in the floodway should be considered likely candidates for buyout this mobile home park is primarily a rental property community rather than individually owned lots as a result it is difficult to determine an appraised value for the lots from the tarrant appraisal district tad records however one of the lots listed on the tad website as individually owned has an appraised land value of approximately $070 per square foot using average lot sizes of approximately 4500 square feet the value of this lot is approximately $320000 if the lots could be purchase for the estimated appraised value the purchase cost would be $42600000 however additional costs will include appraisals relocation assistance closing costs and other costs in accordance with federal acquisition regulations in addition because the lots are rental property it may be necessary to offer more than the appraised value in order to address loss of rental income in addition to specific lots in the skyline mobile home park consideration will be given to acquisition of several repetitive loss structures in the city as discussed previously some of the structures experiencing repetitive losses may be addressed by eliminating the cause of the losses improvements or other means however several of these properties may be candidates for buyout upon approval by the texas water development board and fema of this flood mitigation plan application may be made for a project grant under the flood mitigation assistance program an approved fmp is one condition of eligibility for a project grant similar to the planning grant used to finance development of this fmp the project grant is used primarily to finance acquisition of nfipinsured structures when approved the project grant provides 75 percent of the project cost and the local community contributes the remaining 25 percent of the project cost upon approval of this fmp the city will immediately begin preparation of the project grant application for acquisition of properties as identified above 6 participate in the fema community rating system program contingent upon the implementation of a stormwater utility fee the city will begin efforts to qualify for the community rating system crs program several of the other action items described herein will earn points necessary for crs qualification such as increasing the level of drainage maintenance establishing fully developed conditions water surface elevations for use in regulating minimum finish floor elevations a preliminary evaluation indicates that the necessary points for crs qualification may well be within reach with implementation of the action items described above however implementing the stormwater utility fee may be the key to funding such actions and in turn to reaching the necessary points for crs participation 7 funding considerations it is clear from the preceding discussion that many of the proposed action items are contingent upon implementation of a stormwater utility fee in the absence of this or another similar source of funding it is likely that the possible action items that may be implemented will be limited to the following 1 revising the subdivision regulations to require detention as described above  2 carrying out a public education program  and 3 proceeding with an application for a project grant for buyout of high risk properties  1 exh a 51302 garbage trash junk and weeds footnotes  1  cross reference buildings structures and

provides wastewater utility service wholesale wastewater contract with the city of fort worth as a wholesale customer of the city of fort worth the city agrees to comply with all permit conditions in any way relating to the collection system and the discharge into the collection system accordingly the city of haltom city must comply with state law and regulations regarding pretreatment standards and requirements the purpose of this document is to outline the procedures to be followed by the citys environmental services division division staff in identifying documenting and responding to pretreatment program violations to promote consistent enforcement of the citys pretreatment standards and requirements the city council has authorized the director of public works or hisher designee director to develop and implement an enforcement response plan via article iv industrial wastewater of chapter 98 of the city promulgate regulations that are consistent with and necessary for the administration and enforcement of the industrial waste provisions of the city  21 13012 elements of the plan a comprehensive and effective enforcement plan must reflect the city of haltom citys primary responsibility to enforce all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements as such this enforcement response plan consists of 1 an industrial user or master inventory  2 compliance tracking  and 3 enforcement response criteria and guidelines the city has a contract with the city of fort worth to provide personnel and testing services in implementing its enforcement response plan 21 master industrial user inventory an initial component of an enforcement plan is the industrial user inventory the general pretreatment regulations require that an updated list of industrial users be submitted on an annual basis by the control authority to the approval authority the texas commission on environmental quality tceq in the yearend report this industrial user inventory must indicate whether these industries are regulated by categorical standards local limits or both the categorical and local limits personnel will be assigned to keep the industrial user or master inventory accurate and uptodate the master inventory will be reviewed and periodically updated as needed the master inventory will be maintained in the pretreatment files and a current copy will be provided annually to the director and the manager of the pretreatment services division of the city of fort worth in january and july of each year the following will be available and utilized in maintaining an accurate master inventory  city water records for commercialindustrial accounts   periodic review of area telephone books   periodic review of the manufacturing directories and the manufacturers registers   physical inspections of commercial areas and industrial parks   contact and communication with city departments ie plumbing inspection occupancy permits to learn of new connections  and  industrial user survey questionnaires these questionnaires are to be completed by all users identified on the master inventory users on the master inventory will be identified as to whether they are significant industrial users sius according to 40 cfr v1 or a nonsignificant categorical industrial user nsciu based on the criteria listed in subsection 98150a1 of the city a finding that a siu identified under has no potential for adversely affecting the potws operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement the control authority city of fort worth may determine that such industrial user is not a significant industrial user however the city may at its own discretion issue a nonsignificant industrial user nsiu permit to the facility permitted industrial users siu nsciu nsiu will be subject to the citys pretreatment program in accordance with 40 cfr pretreatment program requirements and chapter 98 article iv of the city sampling shall be conducted in a scientific manner so that the results may be admissible as evidence in a judicial or administrative proceeding compliance data may be collected in either of two methods 1 selfmonitoring by industrial users with findings reported to the city selfmonitoring requirements for industrial users are found in 40 cfr cfr as well as specific requirements as may be imposed by control documents permit issued by the city

by the city the city will conduct monitoring and sampling in accordance with subsection 98150c and d and 40 cfr parts 403 and 136 and any applicable state or local pretreatment standards 22 compliance tracking once collected and assimilated all compliance data must be systematically analyzed to identify violations data must be analyzed and managed with computer tracking system this process must identify all violations including those that do not involve a discharge and must accurately determine whether a significant industrial user siu is in compliance all documentation submitted by a user may serve as evidence in judicial proceedings all required documents must be signed by the authorized signatory and placed in the users file with proof of receipt whether an industrial user is in significant noncompliance snc status shall be determined based on the following criteria  subsections 98152e1e8 of the citys industrial wastewater    group ii permitted nonsignificant industrial user criteria as listed in subsections 98152e3e8 of the citys industrial wastewater    group vi nonsignificant categorical industrial user criteria as listed in subsections 98152e3e8 of the citys

4 permit requirements any nsciu and nsiu facility that violates its permit shall be subject to enforcement actions as listed in the enforcement response guide in addition the director may at his or her discretion reclassify any nsciu or nsiu to that of siu at any time based on established departmental procedures compliance status shall be documented by use of standardized methods and procedures as developed by the director and the environmental division and the control authority city of fort worth per contract with haltom city unless the procedures and methods currently in use allow for

32 response criteria when using the attached enforcement response guide to determine the appropriate enforcement action the following criteria shall be considered a magnitude of the violationincidents of significant noncompliance shall result in the facility being published in the local newspaper as required by 40 cfr f2viii in addition the facility will be subject to appropriate enforcement responses b duration of the violationenforcement response actions shall serve to prevent extended periods of noncompliance regardless of severity from recurring c effect of the violation on the receiving water potw process and sludge disposalany such violation shall be dealt with severely and occurs when an facility discharges a pollutant into the sanitary sewer system which 1 passes potw to a degree that the pass the definition of pass the citys industrial wastewater   2 inhibits or disrupts the potw its treatment processes or operations or its sludge processes use or disposal  3 causes a violation of the potws discharge permit including violations of water quality standards has a toxic effect on the receiving stream ie fish kill or prevents sludge use or disposal d effect of the violation on the potwincidents that result in significant increases in treatment costs or harm city personnel equipment processes or operations including sludge disposal costs shall be subject to appropriate enforcement responses e compliance history of the userrecurring compliance problems even of different program requirements shall result in an escalation of enforcement to insure that consistent compliance is achieved f good faith of the usera users demonstrated willingness to comply shall be taken into account when the city is determining the appropriate enforcement response  however good faith will not eliminate the necessity of an enforcement action good faith shall be defined as the users honest intention to remedy its noncompliance in a timely fashion in conjunction with actions which lend support to this intention 33 response actions following the identification of a pretreatment violation including the determination as to its significance in accordance with the industrial wastewater as revised the most appropriate enforcement response will be selected and applied this response must be proportionate to the violation severity promote compliance in a timely manner and be authorized under state law and the chapter 98 article iv industrial wastewater of the city director is authorized to take the following enforcement response actions a issue a notice of deficiency b issue a notice of violation c schedule and informal meeting d issue administrative orders 1 consent order 2 show cause order 3 compliance order 4 emergency suspension order 5 nonemergency termination order e initiate civil litigation with approval of city manager 1 consent decree 2 injunction 3 civil penaltycost recovery f issue general complaint citations g initiate criminal prosecution h terminate sewer andor water service i issue supplemental enforcement actions bmps ems p2 j issue a public notice snc k increase monitoring and reporting l utilize the economic incentive matrix a brief description of each enforcement action is presented below including a sample document where applicable the sample documents in appendix b are included for illustrative purposes only should the director or the esc need to issue an order they should consult the city attorney with assistance in drafting or reviewing an administrative order or other legal document in addition the enforcement response guidelines found in appendix a of this plan clarify when each enforcement action should be used and identifies personnel authorized to issue an order or initiate an enforcement action a notice of deficiency an informal communication from the city to the user which informs the user of a deficiency if the information requested is not received within ten days a notice of violation will be issued b notice of violation nov an official communication from the city to the noncompliant user which informs the user that a pretreatment violation has occurred multipurpose use for nonsignificant violations and for significant violations generally in conjunction with additional actions sample attached field notice is given for ph and temperature violations in the field formal violations are issued later c informal meeting with user the city may require that the user attend a meeting to discuss any enforcement related issues the city will work with the user as much as possible to schedule the meeting at a convenient time  however it is ultimately the users responsibility to attend any scheduled meeting d administrative orders enforcement documents which direct a user to undertake or to cease specified activities the terms of the administrative order may or may not be negotiated with a user unless more severe action is justified an administrative order is generally used as the first formal response to significant noncompliance and may incorporate compliance schedules administrative penalties and termination of service the director may utilize one of four types of administrative orders a sample of each type is attached administrative orders may require the evaluation of current treatment system andor the installation of new technology to meet limits selfmonitoring requirements and listed frequency are normally added to assure consistent compliance with pretreatment modifications 1 consent order an agreement between the city and the user that normally includes 1 compliance schedules  2 stipulated fines or remedial actions  and 3 signatures of city and industry representatives 2 show cause order an order that directs the user to appear before the city to explain its noncompliance and show cause why more severe enforcement actions against the user should not be levied typically used after informal contacts or novs have failed to resolve noncompliance  however it can be used at any time 3 compliance order an order that directs the user to achieve or restore compliance by a date specified in the order terms need not be discussed with the industry in advance typically used when noncompliance cannot be resolved without construction repair or process changes or to require development of management practices spill prevention programs and other pretreatment program requirements 4 emergency suspension order an order that directs the noncompliant user to cease illegal or unauthorized discharges immediately or to terminate the discharge altogether generally used in situations where the discharge could cause interference or pass or otherwise create an emergency situation 5 nonemergency termination order an order that directs the noncompliant user to cease illegal or unauthorized discharges immediately or to terminate the discharge altogether generally used as escalating enforcement action in a nonemergency situation e civil litigation the formal process of filing lawsuits against a user to secure court ordered action to correct violations and to secure penalties for violations including the recovery of costs to the city for the noncompliance normally pursued when the corrective action required is costly and complex or when the user is considered recalcitrant and unwilling to cooperate the city will typically utilize three types of civil litigation 1 consent decree agreement between the city and the user reached after the lawsuit has been filed signed by the judge assigned to the case 2 injunction agreement between the city and the user reached after the lawsuit has been filed signed by the judge assigned to the case 3 civil penaltiescost recovery reimbursement to the city of all expenses incurred in responding to noncompliance including restoration of the physical plant payment of medical treatment of injured employees and indemnification of the city for all fines assessed against it for discharge permit violations which is generally higher than administrative fines f general complaint citations citations may be issued under the citys police power and authority to enforce ordinances the citations are criminal actions administered citys municipal court g criminal prosecution the formal process of charging individuals andor organization with violations of ordinance provisions that are punishable upon conviction by fines andor imprisonment the purpose of criminal prosecution is to punish noncompliance proceedings and to deter future noncompliance h termination of sewer andor water service the revocation of a users privilege to discharge wastewater regulated by pretreatment services division into the citys sewer system termination may be accomplished by physical severance of the industrys connection to the sewer system by use of an administrative order or by a court ruling this action will be considered to be an appropriate response to industries which have not adequately responded to previous enforcement actions this action requires prior notice to the user sufficient to avoid backflows spills or other harm to the treatment facility a sample of such notice is attached the citys industrial wastewater provide for the termination of water service in addition to sewer service termination i supplemental enforcement actions best management practices bmps environmental management system ems implementation pollution prevention programs p2 when a user has demonstrated a history of noncompliance the city may at its discretion require the user to initiate best management practices the development and implementation of an environmental management system andor appropriate pollution prevention programs offered by agencies such as but not limited to epa and tceq j public notice in accordance with 40 cfr 4038f2viii the city must annually publish a list of all users who significantly violated applicable pretreatment standard requirements during the pretreatment reporting year significant noncompliance shall be identified four times a year in accordance with epa guidelines as shown in the rolling quarters method k increased monitoring and reporting when a user has demonstrated a history of noncompliance the city may increase surveillance of that industry including the requirement of additional selfmonitoring and reporting l economic incentive matrix the actions of a user which results in increased monitoring reporting and administrative efforts due to noncompliance are considered part of an economic cost matrix utilized to offset the cost of the citys pretreatment program and provide an economic incentive for compliance additional fees are assessed for continued noncompliance and further enforcement actions the fees are cumulative as the noncompliance continues each nov administrative order and snc are assessed separately  2333 13012 enforcement guidelines the citys enforcement response guidelines designates several alternative enforcement options for each type of violation once a violation is identified an appropriate enforcement response action shall be selected from the short list of enforcement options listed in the matrix the following factors must be considered when selecting a response action from the options listed  magnitude of the violation  duration of the violation  violations effect on the receiving waters potw process and sludge disposal  violations effect on the potw treatment costs or harms city personnel or equipment  compliance history of the user  good faith of the user  documented affirmative defense criteria as per city g after evaluating each of the above factors the appropriate enforcement response action for the particular violation involved will be selected by authorized city personnel the attached guidelines 1 identify violation type  2 indicate appropriate initial and followup response  and 3 designate personnel responsible for administering each of these responses the guidelines shall be used as follows 1 locate the type of noncompliance in the first column and identify the most accurate description of the violation 2 assess the appropriateness of the recommended responses in column two first offenders or users demonstrating good faith efforts may merit a more lenient response similarly repeat offenders or those demonstrating negligence may require a more stringent response 3 implement an enforcement action from column two to the user specify corrective action or other responses required of the user if any the range of responses in column two are arranged in an escalating order column three indicates personnel responsible for administering each response also in escalating order 4 followup with escalated enforcement action if the users response is not received or violation continues 41 enforcement escalation plan the citys enforcement escalation plan is to be utilized to determine which enforcement action is timely and appropriate and to apply consistency throughout our program the escalation plan as incorporated into the enforcement response guide under the enforcement response and personnel headings columns two and three respectively act as a guideline for enforcement response after consideration of the enforcement response guide section listed above once the noncompliance and circumstances have been identified in columns one and two the range of responses in column two is available to the enforcement agents the personnel that can be involved in the enforcement action are listed in column three generally the responses range from a notice of violation to the termination of sewer andor water service if an industry fails to respond to the initial enforcement action from column two or the industry continues to remain in violation then the next response would be enacted in an expeditious manner per the response time frames outlined below 42 time frames for responses 1 selfmonitoring reports are normally due on the 15th day of the month following the month in which the sample was collected all selfmonitoring reports are reviewed upon receipt by the environmental services division environmental services coordinator and violations will be identified and documented within a reasonable time frame of approximately ten working days violations not related to selfmonitoring will be identified and documented within a reasonable time frame of approximately ten working days of receiving compliance information 2 initial enforcement responses involving contact with the user and requesting information on corrective or preventive actions will occur within 15 working days of violation detection 3 followup actions for continuing or recurring violations will be taken within 60 days of the initial enforcement response for any continuing violations the response will include a compliance schedule if applicable 4 violations which threaten health property or environmental quality are considered emergencies and will receive immediate responses such as halting the discharge or termination of service 5 all violations meeting the criteria for significant noncompliance shall result in the facility being published in the local newspaper as required by 40 cfr f2viii in addition the city will take appropriate enforcement actions based on the criteria listed in this document 6 enforcement response guidelines as set forth in appendix a  2442 13012 appendix a  enforcement response guidelines i nonpermitted users nature of violation enforcement

typical size of meter required to provide service for the residential commercial or industrial property  1 32602 impact fees per service unit a the assessed impact fee per service unit is computed by subtracting 50 percent of the total projected cost of implementing the capital improvement plans from the growthrelated capital construction cost in the capital improvement plans for that category of

the fire demand meter is routinely utilized for regular residential commercial or industrial purposes as evidenced by the record of consumption recorded on the citys meterreading and billing systems the then current impact fee should be assessed and collected from the current owner of the property for routine usage as domestic capacity d following assessment of the impact fees pursuant to subsection b herein no additional impact fees or increases thereof shall be assessed against that development unless the number of service units increases or the property is replatted e in addition to the impact fees assessed in exhibit c the applicable fort worth access fee for water and sanitary sewer service shall be assessed as shown in exhibit d attached hereto  1 32602 calculation of impact fees a following a request for a building permit or tap purchase for new development the city manager shall compute impact fees due for the new development in the following manner 1 the number of

appropriate perunit fee amount determined as set forth in section 98509 3 the fort worth access fee shall be added to determine the total impact fee due b the total amount of each impact fee due for a new development shall not exceed the amounts shown in exhibit d c separate impact fees shall be calculated for water and sanitary sewer service d when a water service or sanitary sewer service is sized up to meet the demand of new development the collected impact fee shall be the difference between the assessed fee for the new larger sized water meter and the assessed fee for the size of the existing meter  1 32602 collection of impact fees a no building permit shall be issued or water or sanitary sewer tap allowed until all impact fees have been paid to the city except as provided

quality of life currently enjoyed by the citizens of haltom city it is the intent of these regulations that no development occur until and unless these minimum levels of service are met therefore each subdivision in the city shall be required to dedicate construct andor upgrade required facilities and infrastructure to a capacity that meets these minimum levels2for each category of public infrastructure a minimum standard of infrastructure and in some cases service level has been developed based upon historic studies and construction projects of the city and other cities these minimum standards take into consideration the soil conditions and topographic configuration of the city the use and impact analyses of the north central texas council of governments in developing standard specifications for public works installation and other historical use and performance experiences of the city that reflect the minimum level of facilities and services that must be built to meet the health safety and welfare of the citizens of haltom city3in order to maintain prescribed levels of public facilities and services for the health safety and general welfare of its citizens the city may require the dedication of easements and rightsofway for or construction of onsite or offsite public works improvements for water wastewater road drainage or park facilities to serve a proposed subdivision or require the payment of fees in lieu thereof if adequate levels of public facilities and services cannot be provided concurrent with the schedule of development proposed the city may deny the subdivision until the public facilities and services can be provided or require that the development be phased so that the availability and delivery of facilities and services coincides with
