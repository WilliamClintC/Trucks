development pud the purpose of this section is to promote creative and efficient use of land by providing design flexibility in the application of the provisions of a primary zoning district of a development plan pursuant to this section and approval of a rezoning to a pud overlay district pursuant to section 1014 approval of a pud shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan b intent this section is intended to protect natural features in private common or public open space improve the efficiency of public streets and utilities provide transitions in land use in keeping with the character of adjacent land use and improve the arrangement of structures facilities and amenities on a site for both private of public benefit the pud provisions are not intended to replace the regulations or restrictions of the underlying zoning district however the pud provisions allow such provisions to be modified or varied provided that such variance is consistent with the general spirit and intent of this chapter and the comprehensive plan c definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this section shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning planned unit development pud means a planned use of property which may involve multiple uses andor multiple structures on a single parcel of property prior to issuance of permits for development within a pud the city council shall adopt a rezoning to a pud overlay district and a development plan pursuant to procedures set forth in this

the property boundaries delineated as wetland 5 district integration the combination of uses that are allowed in separate zoning districts such as a mixed residential allows densities and land use
