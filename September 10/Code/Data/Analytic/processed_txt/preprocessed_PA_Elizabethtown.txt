reduction in water usage c the immediate 25% reduction in water usage is another step along a continuum of responses to the present water supply crisis should drought conditions continue further reductions in usage may be required it must be emphasized that the 25% usage reduction in the emergency area is a valid and attainable figure reflective of the conditions which currently exist d the
