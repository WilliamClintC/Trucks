federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter

sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business 14barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented

from the december 1996 report entitled land characterization study hudson ohio which was prepared by acrt inc the complete report is available for review at the office of the community development director acrt inc conducted a land characterization study for the city of hudson ohio during 1996 the study was performed for the entire 25square mile area within the city of hudson using numerical rating system to show the relative ecological values of both undeveloped and developed land the system called the index of ecological integrity iei is a relatively new concept being used by municipalities for land use planning the iei is similar to other more intensive ecological indices used to assess rivers and streams ohio environmental protection agency 1987 and wetlands andreas and lichvar 1995 the iei is based on several criteria or metrics which are combined to form a composite score indicative of the general ecological quality of an area undeveloped land areas are delineated based on vegetation cover types and developed areas are delineated according to development type andor density iei values are based on aerial photographs as well as extensive field verification summary of iei metrics each polygon land area is scored for several distinct criteria called metrics the following is a summary of each metric for undeveloped areas within the city of hudson level of disturbance the range of potential scores is zero to four with zero indicating the greatest amount of humaninduced disturbance and four indicating the least amount of humaninduced disturbance level of disturbance considers the effect of human activities on the area with the polygon and also considers human activities within adjacent polygons that impact the environment of the subject polygon this metric is used for both developed and undeveloped areas examples of the range of scores include 0  large shopping mall industrial complex or highdensity residential 1  low to middle density residential cemeteries agricultural land 2  successional fields and other areas recovering from past disturbances 3  immature forest or mature forest adjacent to development 4  mature forest land or climax vegetation surrounded by other natural area habitat quality the range of potential scores is zero to four with zero indicating little or no habitat available to wildlife and four indicating unique and valuable habitats essential for desirable wildlife this metric is used only for undeveloped areas examples of the range of scores include 0  little or no available habitat for desirable wildlife 1  limited cover or food sources for wildlife 2  midsuccessional habitats with acceptable levels of cover 3  climax successional habitats requiring extensive time to develop 4  exceptional habitat  nesting or breeding ground for rare threatened or endangered species  wildlife corridors species diversity the range of potential scores is zero to four with zero indicating habitats dominated by monocultures and four indicating a rich mix of flora or fauna this metric is used only for undeveloped areas examples include 0  agricultural fields 1  old fields with few trees 2  even aged forests dominated by pioneer species 3  uneven aged forests with developed canopy and understory 4  exceptionally diverse forests and wetlands hydrology the range of potential scores is zero to four this category considers the physical attributes of an area relative to the movement of water it does not consider the biological attributes of wetlands such as wildlife habitat this metric is used only for undeveloped areas examples include 0  barren fields and open soil 1  upland fields 2  forested uplands adjacent to wetlands 3  forested wetlands 4  natural wetlands serving as flood control basins in addition to the four metrics used in scoring undeveloped areas two classes of qualifiers are used impact on adjacent areas this qualifier class recognizes that land use types may impact the quality of the environment in adjacent areas the potential scores are as follows 1  characteristics of polygon negatively impact adjacent areas such as agricultural lands immediately adjacent to a stream 0  characteristics of polygon have no significant impact on adjacent areas such as a hardwood forest adjacent to a coniferous forest +1  characteristics of polygon positively impact adjacent areas such as an open field providing edge habitat to a surrounding forest water quality for wetland polygons or polygons with included streams water quality is considered the potential scores include 1  water quality is poor such as a retention pond associated with a residential subdivision or an industrial development 0  water quality is average +1  water quality is superior such as a stream flowing natural area the scores of the metrics are combined to form the composite iei value individual metric and composite iei scores for undeveloped areas the following

adopted   adopted   adopted sept 4 2002  adopted sept 17 2003  adopted aug 17 2005  and adopted nov 16 2005 part i  preamble purpose without limiting the generality of the land development the citys interest in regulating the design of individual buildings and sites is determined in part by the extent to which they affect the public realm and the high quality character of the city the city has a responsibility to maintain a high quality public realm and character these architectural design standards standards have been adopted in pursuit of these goals principles without limiting the generality of the planning and zoning the purpose of these standards is to protect hudsons character and to preserve a highquality built environment throughout hudson five principles are given below these principles are a summary of the values that people in hudson found to be most important in establishing the character of the city these principles are policies that provide the foundation of both the standards and the architectural review process the architectural and historic board of review ahbr shall look upon these principles as a framework for making discretionary decisions athe creation and maintenance of the public realm takes precedence over individual buildings the public realm is that space occupied both in physical and visual terms by the public it is created by such elements as the parts of the building that are visible from the street the front yard the sidewalk street trees and lighting and the street itself the historic residential and institutional areas of the city strongly influence the character of hudson although the architecture of this area is diverse it is held together by a strongly defined public realm the green is also part of the public realm in the historic village the public realm is clearly delineated by the consistency of narrow streets mature street trees sidewalks and the setback of buildings the rhythm of houses and side yards provides another dimension of unity the public realm in all areas of hudson needs to have similar delineation although the particular dimensions and details are scaled to new kinds of buildings and lot patterns bbuildings shall maintain a high level of architectural quality architectural quality does not refer to specific style or details but to the general level of composition materials and design integrity these standards are not meant to encourage or discourage any particular style of building within hudson quality building design is a complicated matter which needs to balance many competing requirements cthe site plan and building shall respect the land and the environment in which they are placed an attractive city takes advantage of its natural setting buildings should be sited to minimize regrading and to take advantage of natural features including mature trees for the most part environmental issues are covered by the citys land development there shall be architectural variety within a defined framework the historic village displays a high degree of variety in its buildings the overall environment is nonetheless coherent because of the strength of the urban framework and a general uniformity of building scale variety within this coherent framework enriches the public realm enew buildings and alterations shall respect the existing context and framework the design of any building shall be judged in reference to its site and the character of its surroundings not as an independent object the site plan for all new buildings shall be prepared with a clear understanding of the framework that exists or is being created in a particular area standards zoning and other regulations coordination with zoning and development standards the normal process of review for new building projects will require the applicant to satisfy zoning and development standards prior to being reviewed by the ahbr applicants are advised to review the land development issues of design especially siting landscaping direction of approach and building orientation may be determined under prior review part ii  procedures approval and discretion of the ahbr aproposals which the ahbr determines comply with the standards shall be approved without limiting the discretion of the ahbr to make judgements rendered in accordance with these standards in no case shall an applicant be required to make changes to a proposal which are not supported by these standards the ahbr may offer additional advice and suggestions at its discretion  however such advice shall be clearly stated as such bin making architectural review decisions the ahbr shall rely on the standards and where it is unclear that a project fulfills the standards the ahbr shall refer to the principles enumerated in cthe ahbr may waive any requirement of these standards in order to approve a proposed project if the ahbr finds that the project fulfills the five principles enumerated in meets one of the following conditions 1the project is an exceptional design meaning that it is either especially creative or it is designed in response to unique situation such as a very difficult site or an unusual program requirement or 2exceptional and unique conditions exist that create a practical difficulty in complying with the requirements of these standards the ahbr should consider the factors enumerated in as defined in the land development determining practical difficulty dthe ahbr shall review only those elements of the building which contribute to its exterior appearance including the massing roof facade signs siting of the building and landscaping building materials and colors should be compatible within the design scheme and to surrounding buildings 1all sides of a building will be reviewed for compliance with these standards however the public faces of a building may be held to a different standard public faces shall be defined as the front facade and the two sides adjoining the front facade 1 rear facades will not be subject to standards which are specifically directed at public faces 2all permanent signs shall comply with the standards enumerated in isigns that exceed two 2 square feet in area shall be reviewed by the ahbr to ensure compliance with these standards ii signs that are two 2 square feet or less in area shall be reviewed by the department of community development to ensure compliance with these standards  images0006609png  eapplicants shall when required pursuant to this section submit a sign plan for review and approval by the ahbr 1a sign plan shall be required for all multioccupant buildings and shall be submitted by the owner of a multioccupant building whenever ia new multioccupant building is constructed  or iian existing building is renovated or remodeled and after the renovation or remodeling there is more than one occupant that occupies the remodeled or renovated building  or iiiwhen a replacement sign is proposed for an existing multi occupant building 2the sign plan shall create a set of specific standards for sign design and placement on the proposed building and on the site 3the sign plan shall contain the following ibuilding sections and elevations drawn at an appropriate scale iicomputation of the maximum total sign area and the maximum area of signs for individual storefronts or building units affected by the sign plan iiian accurate indication on the elevationsection drawings of the location of each existing and proposed sign 4the sign plan shall specify one or more standards for consistency among all signs on the multioccupant buildings included in the sign plan with regard to and in the priority of the elements listed below iuniform sign placement andor sign height  iiuniform size andor shape  iiitype of sign construction materials and letter components ie sign panel vs raised letters and framing  ivtype of lighting and the type of lighting fixtures if any  vuniform background colors or harmonious use of a limited range of complementary background colors andor harmonious use of a limited range of complementary colors for the sign lettering 5the complexity of the sign plan shall be based on the level of varietycohesiveness of the building architecture and the surrounding area when a building exhibits a high degree of architectural uniformity the sign plan should require a high degree of consistency among sign elements and therefore should specify standards for most or all of the elements set forth in subsection 4 above procedures for building type standards abuilding types these standards are organized around the idea of building types a set of buildings which have similar massing and entrances are considered to be the same type buildings of the same type may be used for different purposes such as apartments or office buildings types are also distinguished from the idea of style the same type of building may be many different styles bhow to identify a type a building type is primarily identified by the number shape proportion and relationship of the building masses a secondary consideration is the location of the entrances architectural style roof shape material building size and land use are not indicators of type chudson types in order to preserve the character of hudson all new buildings built in hudson are required to conform to one of the hudson types more specifically described in 2 1some building types are restricted for certain uses and in specific districts of hudson the typesdistrict chart below lists these restrictions duse of type in these standards in preparing an application for review under these standards the applicant and the ahbr shall use the following procedure 1locate the project within its zoning district of hudson 2determine what building types are allowed or prohibited in that district and under what conditions from ii3 typesdistrict chart 3identify the building type that most closely resembles the building that will be altered or built once the type is identified the building design will be subject to all applicable standards in to the type standards for that type which

buildings all buildings regardless of building type and historic status shall conform with the following standards aresponsibility to contribute to the public realm all buildings must contribute to the public realm in their design by presenting a welldesigned public facade 1the front door or main entrance to a building shall be visible from the street an entrance to a public building shall be clear and visible from the street and not obscured by building masses or fences 2blank walls without openings are not allowed on public faces of any building trash and loading areas are allowed on side faces if screened from the street 3the design and massing of the building should acknowledge the primary direction of approach in areas where one has been defined 4attached garages shall not face the street 5principal residential structures on corner ithe building shall face the corner if the approach to the corner places the lot directly in the line of sight all other siting and orientation requirements shall apply iian attached garage shall be sited so that its door is not visible from the primary direction of approach  images0006613png   images0006615png  6 the overall design of the building and the site should take into account the general placement of signs so that all permanent signs and their associated lighting fixtures complement the appearance and architecture of the building and site i all new buildings and alterations to existing buildings should be designed to create appropriate and clearly identifiable locations for occupants signs iiif a new or renovated building facade does not include a clearly identifiable location for a sign the owner and ahbr will determine the appropriate location iiiif a specific sign proposal is submitted with the building plans and is therefore available during the architectural review process the sign proposal should be used as a guide for making the above determinations brequirements for variety within a neighborhood or area substantial variety in architectural style types of ornament and detail and materials is desirable 1single family or two family residential buildings in proximity to each other on the street shall not look alike the property being reviewed shall be compared to the buildings on the three lots on either side of it and to the building on the lot facing it across the street and to the two lots on either side of that building 3 in cases where this description is not conclusive in determining the referent properties the diagrams will prevail notwithstanding the above the referent properties will not include any of the following iproperties which face onto a different street than the proposed property unless they are actually adjoining or directly across a street as in a corner situation 3c and 3f iiproperties where all parts of the house are outside a 1000 feet  radius from the front door of the proposed house 3g 2the following shall determine whether buildings look alike ibuildings which are different in type as described in of these standards do not by definition look alike 2  images0006619png   images0006621png  ii buildings which are the same type must differ from one another in two of the following a wall material b architectural style c major features such as porches or turrets d organization and number of bays e wing configuration or f roof shape these terms are defined in appendix ii 3 except in the case of accessory buildings historic buildings or buildings contributing to a historic district no requirement of these standards shall be interpreted to require a particular architectural style for any building carchitectural character 1 the main building of an institutional use shall have an architectural character consistent with its public nature it shall be easily distinguished from residential buildings 2the architecture of a commercial building may not act as a recognizable logo for a national corporation or franchise the building architecture is deemed to be a logo when the specific business occupying the proposed building could still be easily identified if all the allowable signs were to be removed daccessory buildings large accessory buildings greater than 79 square feet in gross area shall bear the following relationship to the main structure of the property 1no accessory building may be larger in ground floor footprint or taller than the main body of the building except for agricultural uses the planning and zoning restricts height in most districts 2enclosed accessory buildings shall incorporate some elements similar to the main body for example similar corner boards window types or materials 3the roof of an enclosed accessory building should be the same roof shape as the roof of the main structure 4open garden structures such as pergolas and gazebos and enclosed greenhouses which are primarily glass shall not be subject to the above restrictions 5all facades including the rear over ten 10 feet long shall have at least one window or door opening fenestration placement on the accessory structure shall be proportional to the house eaccessory buildings small accessory buildings less than 79 square feet in gross area shall be screened from view from the public way to the extent possible on the site 1accessory buildings less than 79 square feet in gross area shall be screened from view from the public way to the extent possible on the site 2small accessory structures shall not be constructed of prefabricated metal or synthetic panels ffences 1the finished side of all walls and boundaries must face the common property line boundary or the public way 2except in district 8 only the following fence materials shall be allowed wood or vinyl closely resembling wood wrought iron or aluminum closely resembling wrought iron stone or brick all other fence materials including chain link and vinylclad chain link are prohibited unless substantially screened from public view by landscaping or other means 3fence heights and materials shall be compatible with their site location and surrounding development fences in the front yard shall be more formal in design and lower in height when sited close to the street or sidewalk fences in the rear yard offer more flexibility with greater allowance for height and design gdetails for new residential construction additions and alterations 1all steps in front of doors must be the full width of the opening regardless of whether all portions of the opening are functioning doors all steps shall incorporate closed risers and double handrails when handrails are proposed 2all chimneys must match the foundation material fireplace vents when incorporated shall be located at the rear elevation 3exposed foundations and tie courses shall be of a consistent material on all elevations 4all skylights must be flat no bubble type 5all decks and porches without a perimeter foundation exposing more than eighteen 18 inches between the facia and the

meters and equipment shall be located at the side and rear elevation 8large expanses of blank wall are to be avoided fenestration placement should be at a maximum of approximately every 12 feet 9enclosed porches and additions on existing decks shall incorporate skirting material compatible with the structure hmechanical equipment all mechanical equipment must be screened from public view whether on the ground with acceptable fencing or landscaping or on the roof with parapets mechanical roof screens are not acceptable a sight line study must be submitted showing mechanical equipment is not visible from the centerline of surrounding streets and property lines alterations to existing properties  all types the character of hudson is preserved by maintaining the integrity of buildings as they are altered aalterations to nonhistoric buildings the following shall apply to all buildings which are not historic properties as defined in b 1in the case of an alteration to an existing property an applicant must comply with the type design standards in to the extent that they apply to the alteration itself 2applicants will be permitted to repair or replace existing non conforming elements without bringing the element into conformance with the standards for example shutters or windows may be replaced with essentially the same elements 3if applicants propose to replace any element with another that is not the same for example aluminum windows for wood windows the applicant will be required to conform fully with the standards for those elements 4applicants may not be compelled to alter any part of the existing property which would otherwise not be affected by the proposed alteration 5for existing buildings which do not conform to the type catalogue in alterations will be allowed as long as they conform to the general principles enumerated in they are compatible with the existing architectural style materials and massing of the building bstandards for historic properties all districts historic properties include those buildings which are contributing to historic districts and buildings which are designated as historic landmarks by the city council other buildings which have historic or architectural significance may be also be reviewed as historic properties with the mutual agreement of the ahbr and the applicant 1historic landmarks or buildings within historic districts which are greater than fifty years old will not be reviewed according to the type standards in such buildings will be reviewed according to the secretary of the interiors standards for historic rehabilitation see appendix i and national park service preservation briefs #14 and #16 2in altering historic properties the applicant is advised to refer to historic surveys and style guides which have been prepared specifically for hudson including the uniform architectural criteria by chambers & chambers 1977  hudson a survey of history buildings in an ohio town by lois newkirk 1989  and square dealers by eldredge and graham 3hudsons historic district and historic landmarks contain a wealth of properties with well preserved and maintained high quality historic building materials the preservation of these materials is essential to the distinguishing character of individual properties and of the district deteriorated materials shall be repaired where feasible rather than replaced in the event that replacement is appropriate the new material should be compatible in composition design color and texture iuse of substitute materials for historic properties as defined in b athe ahbr shall review detailed documentation of the existing site conditions bthe ahbr shall request the patching and repair of existing materials cif the repair or replacement of existing nonhistoric materials is requested ahbr shall request removal of the nonhistoric material to expose the historic material so that it may be assessed dif the ahbr concurs that the condition of the material requires replacement in some or all portions of the structure like materials should be used substitute materials may be considered when the proposed materials do not alter the historic appearance of the structure and the proposed materials are compatible in proportion size style composition design color and texture with the existing historic materials iiuse of substitute materials for proposed additions to existing historic properties athe placement of the addition shall be reviewed to determine its visibility from the public realm bsubstitute materials are acceptable provided they are compatible in proportion size style composition design color and texture with the existing historic materials iiinew freestanding structures and nonhistoric properties the use of substitute materials is acceptable provided they are compatible in proportion size style composition design color and texture of historic materials ivall applications are subject to c combination types aoccasionally a structure will be proposed which appears to be a combination of two types an example of this is the typical officewarehouse building which has a single story simple mass attached to a long type building in this case the applicant may request that the building be reviewed as if it were two separate but attached buildings the board may approve such a building if it meets all the following conditions 1the separated parts would meet the requirements of these standards if they were not attached to each other 2the two parts bear some relationship to each other in materials details or design of openings 3if either part is an historic building the combination building meets or exceeds the secretarys standards part iv  building types standards and catalogue applicants are advised to refer to appendix ii for definitions of mass roof shape wall materials typical and special windows projections and regulating lines single story simple mass aidentifiers this

ialterations alterations made to this type structure shall be allowed if the effect is to produce a structure which would be compatible with these standards long mass type aidentifiers buildings of this type are constructed of a repetitive structure of loadbearing wall slabs or loadbearing columns with nonload bearing infill this repetitive structure provides the opportunity to break the overwhelming length of the buildings walls down into smaller repetitive pieces these pieces called bays constitute the basic unit of the buildings design there are sometimes multiple entrances along the front long side the long type building may also have a continuous arcade 24  images0006645png bmass the mass of the building is a single block with multiple bays 1the separation of one bay from

standards for signs all permanent signs reviewed by the ahbr shall comply with the following standards diversitycohesiveness of signs seen in a series within a commercial area or development where multiple storefronts are situated side by side the level of variety or cohesiveness in the design of signs that are seen in a series or sequence should be commensurate with the level of variety or cohesiveness presented by the architecture of the buildings a variety in the design of signs among different storefronts should be encouraged when the architecture of the buildings suggests variety for example the downtown area consists of a number of different buildings each exhibiting its own unique design and character signs on these different buildings should reflect a similar amount of diversity 44  images0006649png  bstorefronts with common architectural elements should have signs that share continuity of design so that the placement and design of individual signs contribute to the cohesive appearance created by the common architectural elements for example a series of storefronts that because of their architecture and design have the appearance of a single building should have occupant signs that share common elements 45 csign plans owners of multioccupant buildings shall develop sign plans in conformance with e for the building and site to aid in determining the level of varietycohesiveness required for signs placement of signs on buildings signs should be designed and placed on buildings to be compatible with and complement the appearance of the building aall signs should be reviewed for their impact on the overall building facade bthe sign and associated lighting fixtures should complement the architecture of the building on which it is placed and should be placed in an appropriate location on the building facade cif the building design does not clearly identify the appropriate placement for a sign panel 4647  then individual letters are encouraged unless there is a clear location for adding panels such as establishing one or more repetitive common architectural features in order to create a repetitive sequence 48  images0006651png  d when ever a new or renovated sign is proposed for an existing building 1 it may be deter mine d that building alterations are needed in order for the proposed sign to be properly placed on the building facade 2any inappropriate and extraneous elements from past remodeling projects should be removed prior to the installation of the proposed sign to improve the clarity and design of the proposed sign and restore the intended character of the building ea sign should be confined with in the fascia consistent with signs on adjacent buildings and shall not extend beyond the identified signable area on the building or over the edges of the sign panel fin multioccupant buildings signs for first floor occupants should not extend above the windowsill of the second story unless the establishment is also located on the second floor gcolors of the sign and the sign background should be compatible with the buildings colors specific standards for window signs projecting signs and ground signs   images0006653png aprojecting signs the size of the lettering and graphics on a projecting sign should be appropriate for viewing by pedestrians bground signs the design and placement of ground signs and associated lighting fixtures should complement the overall visual appearance of the site 1ground signs should be designed to relate to and share common design elements with the building and the signs attached to the building 2 whenever a building is located 30 feet or more from the street its ground sign should be placed on a solid base    images0006655png 3 approved yearround landscaping shall be used around the base of the sign to screen lighting fixtures and sources in compliance with the land development 50 4when properly screened the lower two 2 feet of the solid base of a ground sign may be exempt from the sign area calculation 50 5signs on structural supports separated from the ground by air are more appropriately located in front of buildings located closer to the street 51  images0006657png  6ground signs should be spaced or combined along the street frontage in a manner that ensures that one ground sign does not obscure the view of another ground sign 7a ground sign that provides a directory of occupants for a multi occupant building should have simplicity of design to compensate for the additional amount of information provided ie utilize common elements such as the same background color or other common elements etc overall design of signs wall awning window projecting and ground signs athe size and shape of the sign shall be in proportion to the space the sign is to occupy 1a sign whether comprised of a panel or individual letters should not exceed approximately 70% of the height and length of the signable area of the building 525354  images0006659png  2 the lettering within a sign panel shoul d not exceed approximately 70 % of the height and length of the sign panel 53 belements of the sign should create an overall cohesive design reflect

contrast 4be designed with a limited number of and harmonious use of colors 5be constructed with a minimum number of materials cthe message should be easy to read from the intended vantage point  public street public sidewalk or public parking lot  but not be out of scale with the building site or streetscape 1the ratio of the message to the background should permit easy recognition of the message 2lettering size should be the size needed to ensure the sign can be seen from the intended distance 3the number of items of information displayed should be consistent with the amount of information that can be comprehended by the intended viewer igenerally 10 items or less of information per sign are a typical amount of information the average person can comprehend while driving this is based upon the principle that the more readable the type face and the better the contrast between the letter and the back ground the more readable and comprehendible the sign ii an item of information includes a symbol geometric shape logo word abbreviation or number or a grouping of letters and numbers which together convey meaning for signs combining different shapes each shape may be considered an item of information 55  images0006661png  4lettering and numbers less than three 3 inches in height should only be used when intended to be viewed from a vantage point on the interior of

usually distinguished by their plan and should be identifiable by a change in the roof height or direction  images0006617png  a main body is usually centrally located in the plan is the largest footprint and height mass and is different from all other masses in that it can be understood as a complete building if all the other masses were subtracted from it 27 a wing is always attached to a main body and will not stand alone in composition its basic rectangular shape minus protrusions is attached but not overlapped on the main body it is smaller in footprint or height than the main body it usually has a separate roof all faces of a wing must be wide enough to contain the typical window of the building parts of a building which are not this large are projection  see below 27 an intersecting mass is distinguished from a wing in the plan of the building the basic rectangle of an intersecting mass appears to overlap the main body or other masses 19 an ell body is found only in ell type buildings it is a single mass with an ell shape and a roof that turns a corner but is otherwise continuous ie it has the same height materials and shape 12 a central mass is a mass found in large type buildings which is treated like a main body it is larger than wings and centrally located for example unlike a main body there may be more than one central mass in a large type building roof all roof shapes are allowed in hudson for the purpose of distinguishing different roof shapes the following shall be considered different from one another 27a a gable roof  front facing b gable roof  side facing c cape roof d hip roof gambrel roof  front facing e gambrel roof  side facing f flat roof g shed roof  front facing h shed roof  side facing i mansard roof for the purposes of look alike the roof shape on the main body of the building shall determine the orientation of the roof ie whether the roof is frontfacing or sidefacing materials wall material the walls of a building are all the solid surfaces which are perpendicular to the ground including areas in roof peaks but not including expressed structural columns window and door surrounds decorative rough timbers cornice boards and other details 28 materials which are the same but are a different color or texture shall not be considered different materials for the purposes of these design standards for the purposes of

it may be any style and shape once a typical window has been designated as typical all windows which are not typical are called special the number of special windows is limited by the guidelines some slight variations are allowed in typical windows windows which are the same proportion and style as the typical window but are larger or smaller may be counted as typical windows 29  images0006672png  windows which are the same width and style as the typical window but are shorter or longer may be counted as typical windows 30 multiples of the typical window shall be counted as typical windows 31 typical windows may have different types of attached details for example cornices shutters and still be considered typical the details must be used consistently on all sides of that mass for example the same detail must be used on all typical windows on the ground floor 32 2special windows typical windows cease to be typical and must be counted as special when the internal divisions for example mullions of the window are different than the typical window 33  images0006674png  the window has additional lights added to it for example a fan light or side lights 34  images0006676png  the window is a different width and height than the typical window and is not proportional special windows may not be larger in overall area than four times a typical window for the purposes of defining windows sidelights and fan lights abutting a door or window shall not be considered special windows regulating lines regulating lines are invisible horizontal and vertical lines which anchor the placement of openings and other elements of a building they are an aid to composition 35 openings may be centered on vertical lines or they may be lined up against them regulating lines do not need to be symmetrical but they should have some demonstrable order openings need not occur at all intersections of regulating lines details consistent use of details is required by the standards for most types examples of consistent use of details include same cornice carried all around a single mass window shutters used on all the upper level typical windows of a single mass exposed foundation walls treated the same in a single mass 36  images0006678png  projections projections are areas of a building plan which push out from the rectangular shape of the mass to which they are attached projections have some wall material and may have windows on any side projections which extend more than five feet from the mass to which they are attached are considered to be wings projections are normally treated as if they were a part of the mass to which they are attached architectural style most architectural styles are allowed in hudson however some architectural styles normally have massing elements which may not be allowed in hudson for the purposes of these guidelines the following are considered to be different styles from one another  images0006680png victorian queen anne federal georgian greek revival tudor italianate french empire craftsman richardsonian prairie style ranch modern international style postmodern contemporary eclectic a good reference book for stylistic definition is the field guide to american houses not all elements of a building need to conform to the style in order for that building to be classified as a particular style for the purposes of these guidelines  images0006682png  at the discretion of the ahbr eclectic or unclassifiable buildings which are extremely different in appearance from one another may be considered to be different styles wing configuration for the purpose of look alike the wing configurations shown in 38 shall be considered to be different from one another bay organization and number a bay in a traditional design is a section of a facade with a single window 39 buildings may be counted as having either a different number of bays or a different bay organization not both for the purposes of lookalike the following shall be considered different bay organization symmetrical bays around a central front door 40 symmetrical bays with an asymmetrical front door 41 asymmetrical bays with
