and pressure tanks all storage facilities are filled or connected to public water only the water in the tanks to be maintained in a potable condition otherwise class 3 systems are the same as class 1

supplied from public mains similar to classes 1 and 2 and with the auxiliary water supply on or available to the premises  or an auxiliary supply may be located within 1700 feet of the pumper connection class 4 systems will normally require backflow protection at the service connection the type air gap or rpa will generally depend on the quality of the auxiliary supply 5 class 5 directly supplied from public mains and interconnected with auxiliary supplies such as pumps taking suction from reservoirs exposed to contamination or rivers and ponds  driven wells mills or other industrial water systems  or where antifreeze or other additives are used class 4 and 5 systems normally would need maximum protection air gap or rpa to protect the public potable water system 6 class 6 combined industrial and fire protection systems supplied from the public water mains only with or without gravity storage or pump suction tanks class 6 system protection would depend on the requirements of
