while preserving the flow of traffic in terms of safety roadway capacity and efficiency access shall be managed to maintain an adequate level of service and to maintain the functional classification of roadways as required by the citys transportation improvement program major roadways including arterials and collectors serve as the primary system for moving people and goods access management is a primary concern on these roads local access streets and driveways provide access to individual properties alleys can provide secondary access to properties if vehicular access and circulation are not properly designed these roadways will be unable to accommodate the needs of development and serve their transportation function this article attempts to balance the right of reasonable access to private property with the right of all citizens it also requires all developments to construct planned streets arterials and collectors and to extend local access streets also see g to achieve this policy intent roadways have been categorized in the comprehensive plan by function and classified for access purposes based upon their level of importance and function see g regulations have been applied to these roadways for the purpose of reducing traffic accidents personal injury and property damage attributable to access systems and to thereby improve the safety and operation of the roadway network this will protect the substantial public investment in the existing transportation system and reduce the need for expensive remedial measures these regulations also further the orderly layout and use of land protect community character and conserve natural resources by promoting welldesigned road and access systems and preventing the unplanned subdivision of land b applicability

should also contain a variety of habitat features eg variety of topography riparian areas canyons habitat edges plant communities blocks should be relatively undisturbed as indicated by a dominance of native vegetation portions may contain disturbed habitat shrubsteppe habitat supports comparatively high wildlife density and diversity provides important wildlife breeding habitat and important seasonal ranges this habitat has limited availability high vulnerability to alteration and supports unique and dependent species whitetailed deer winter range winter range is determined by a combination of factors elevation slope aspect snow depth browse quality and quantity presence of closed canopy mature forests temperatures and traditional deer movement patterns closed canopies of mature forests along streams are extremely important whitetail habitat moose habitat aquatic feeding sites are found in areas of slow moving water ponds swamps and pot holes which contain abundant submergent and emergent vegetation larger aquatic areas are preferred these sites are characterized by a broad zone of hiding cover around the perimeter of the feeding site calving sites are characterized by roadless blocks of mature timber of 80 acres or greater which provide hiding cover and are adjacent to good forage where human disturbance is minimal elk habitat generally the winter and summer ranges of a herd of elk are geographically separate in eastern washington winter range consists of shrubsteppe bunch grass of shrub plant communities adjacent to forest zones special features of elk habitat include corridors and wallows these features are characterized by screening vegetation and lack disturbance during hunting season elk seek the largest cover patches in their range at other times of the year smaller cover patches within 600 feet of forage areas are most important wildlife corridors wildlife corridors are landscape feature that facilitate the biologically effective transport of animals between larger patches of habitat dedicated to conservation functions such corridors may facilitate several kinds of traffic including frequent foraging movements seasonal migrations or the once in a lifetime dispersal of juvenile animals these are transitional habitats and need not contain all the habitat elements required for the long term survival or reproduction of its migrants landscape linkages landscape linkages differ from a movement corridor in that the complete range of community and ecosystem processes continue to operate within it plants and smaller animals are able to move between larger landscapes over a period of generations  city of liberty lake development  49 priority species status amphibians spotted frog state and federal

higher the r factor for the spokane area an r of 54 was used k soil erodibility factor is the soils susceptibility of soil detachment by water the soils k factor is based on the relationship of five soil factors  1 percent silt plus very fine sand 2 percent sand greater than 010 mm 3 organic matter content 4 soil structure and 5 permeability k factor values range from 002 to 064 l and s are used together and are referred to as the ls factor the l part is the length of slope which is the distance from a point of origin of overland flow to the point where the slope gradient decreases enough that deposition begins or where runoff water enters a welldefined channel that may be part of a drainage network the s part is the percent slope between two points ls value is the relationship between the length of slope and steepness of slope for example ls for slope lengths of 50 feet are 76 at 8 percent slope 101 at 12 percent slope and 142 at 20 percent slopes see table below the ls value is the value at the intersection of the length of slope and percent slope slope length is the distance in feet of an uninterrupted uniform slope see table b5 subsection c below the building site development water erosion hazard table was created using the modified version of usle soft loss from water erosion was calculated for various soil k factors at slope groups of 0 to 8 percents 8 to 15 percent and more than 15 percent it is assumed that construction will expose the soil surface for a period of 3 to 6 months using the estimated erosion for the period of time the soil is exposed an index based on k factor and slope was calculated this index is then used to assign erosion hazard ratings of slight moderate or severe the index is a product of k times the average slope of the soil map unit kave slope slight has an index of less than or equal to 30 less than 5 tonsunit per acreyr moderate has an index of 30 to 40 5 to 8 tonsunit per acreyr and severe has an index of greater than 40 greater than 8 tonsunit per acreyr only soils with a severe rating are shown on the table that follows the building site development water erosion hazard table for spokane county provides a tool

administrator shall establish a periodic inspection program to determine compliance with permit requirements and the provisions of this article f explanation of aquifer susceptibility map  shadi a method for assessing ground water susceptibility in spokane county introduction in the language of water resources management the term vulnerability describes the potential risk for the contamination of an aquifer vulnerability depends on two factors aquifer susceptibility the level of ground water protection provided by the natural environment and the pollution potential land use activities above the aquifer this document describes the development and application of a susceptibility model for spokane county the shadi ground water susceptibility model is based on the same general approach as the drastic model drastic is a model developed by the national water well association in cooperation with the us epa aller l et al 1987 drastic has been used in its original and modified form in most areas of the united states swanson r 1994  palmquist r 1991 the shadi modification developed for use in spokane county uses the following five environmental characteristics to assess susceptibility soil media hydraulic conductivity annual recharge depth to ground water importance of the vadose zone to use the shadi model data each of the five characteristics must be mapped at a common level of resolution collecting the required data is a time consuming process if summary data in map or tabular form is not available for the characteristics for spokane county simplifying the model to five elements greatly reduces the work required to develop the model without losing the ability to resolve differences in susceptibility these five characteristics reflect essentially the same range of variability that the seven drastic characters would reflect when applied to spokane county the result of applying the shadi model is a set of susceptibility ratings usually presented in map form for discrete geographic units in the study area the following relationship is used to calculate the final susceptibility value aquifer susceptibility   s x ws + h x wh + a x wa + d x i where s h a d and i are described above and ws wh and wa are weighting factors to bring the relative importance of soil hydraulic conductivity and annual recharge into balance with the depth to watervadose zone term both the ranking values and weighting values used in shadi are consistent with those used in drastic aquifer susceptibility using methods like shadi can be applied manually by mapping the various characteristics on tissue paper overlaying the maps of the characteristics tracing the boundaries of areas with a unique set of characteristics and manually totaling the ratings for each area however this process is easily accomplished using geographic information system computer software the shadi data sets for spokane county will be developed in a format that will allow the automated delineation of unique area boundaries and the totaling of the final susceptibility rating for those areas like drastic shadi is intended to establish the relative risk to contamination that exists for aquifers examined using a consistent database the model results from one study should not be compared with those from another similarly once a study area has been defined it should be treated as a whole breaking a study area into subsets requires a reassessment of the ratings  city of liberty lake development  68 applied explanation of ratings shown on shadi map layers soil media shadi ratings for soil type for most purposes soil is considered to be that part of the earths surface in which plants grow the soil layer extends from the land surfaces to the bottom of the root zone  the depth to which plant roots extend the soil zone is characterized by high biological activity in a semiarid climate like that around spokane a root zone of 5 to 6 feet is common for most contaminant discharges within an aquifer recharge area the soil is the first line of defense against contamination many of the biochemical actions that take place in the soil can destroy potentially harmful wastes result in their removal by plants or lead to their being bound up as part of the soil matrix most of these processes depend on the amount of clay silt and organic material in the soil high levels of one or more of these components lead to better ground water protection table 1 provides a summary of the shadi ratings for the soil types common in spokane county table 1 shadi ratings for soil type soil type shadi rating silty loam 3 sandy 6 rockygravelly 9 weighting factor 2 hydraulic conductivity shadir ratings for hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity refers to the ease with which water moves aquifer media this is dependent on the amount of interconnected void space in the aquifer loose sand and gravel or highly fractured rock have the highest hydraulic conductivity aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity more easily disperse contaminants away from the point where they enter the ground water table 2 provides a summary of the shadi ratings for the hydraulic conductivity of the common aquifer types found in spokane county table 2 shadi ratings for hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity feetsec shadi rating high >  10 medium high    8 medium    6 medium low    4 low <  2 weighting factor 6 annual recharge shadi ratings for annual recharge the amount of water recharged to an aquifer is an important element in assessing ground water susceptibility because it is the recharge water that carries contaminants to the ground water in  city of liberty lake development  69 general the greater the amount of recharge the greater the potential impact because precipitation as with all climatic characteristics varies greatly from year to year annual recharge also varies greatly for long term planning purposes using average values for precipitation to calculate recharge should produce good results for tracking potential ground water impacts and estimating the amount of water available for use however recharge levels at both extremes can skew the overall impact extremely high recharge may dilute the concentration of contaminants to below the background levels in ground water conversely extremely low recharge over a period of time may result in the accumulation of contaminants in the soil a normal or above normal recharge period could then flush these contaminants into ground water in a short period of time the susceptibility rating values associated with various levels of recharge found in spokane county are summarized in table 3 table 3 shadi ratings for annual recharge annual recharge inches shadi rating 24 3 47 6 710 8 10+ 8 weighting factor 4 depth to water shadi ratings for depth to water depth to water is important in establishing the susceptibility of an aquifer because it determines the thickness of the material contaminated water must travel before it reaches ground water in general the more material contaminated water moves greater the probability that some or all of the contaminants will be removed a number of physical eg filtration of suspended solids chemical eg precipitation of phosphorus and biological bacterial break down of organic chemicals into co2 and water may affect the contaminants in recharge water in addition to the amount of material that the water must pass deeper water tables usually mean longer travel times the longer the travel time the greater the opportunity for contaminant removal table 4 provides a summary of the shadi ratings for the several depth to water ranges found in spokane county table 4 shadi ratings for depth to water depth to water  feet shadi rating 015 10 1550 8 50100 6 100+ 4 weighting factor importance of the vadose zone importance of the vadose zone shadi ratings for importance of the vadose zone the vadose zone is the unsaturated zone between the bottom of the root zone and the water table as a rule the vadose zone is composed of material similar to that found in the soil or that which contains the aquifer because it is below the root zone there is little biological activity under ordinary conditions so while the vadose zone is important for some of the same reasons it is likely to be less effective than soil as indicated above the finer the material the better the  city of liberty lake development  70 vadose zone is at removing contaminants where the vadose zone is composed of solid rock the size of cracks and fractures and the complexity of the fracture zone determines the contaminant removal ability the main difference between shadi and drastic lies in how the nature of the material in the vadose zone is accounted for in the model not all material behave the same ability to retain contaminants or facilitate their decomposition  silty materials will retain more water and hold it longer than coarse gravel the larger surface area exposed by finer materials usually increases the amount of contaminants that can be removed in shadi the importance of the vadose zone is used as a weighting factor for depth to water under this scheme a thick layer of coarse material may be a poorer buffer to contamination than a thin layer of finer soil where there are confining layers between the land surface and the water table these zones increase the removal of contaminants by providing longer travel times and providing a zone of fine material that increases contaminant removal table 5 provides a summary of the shadi ratings for the vadose zone materials common in spokane county table 5 shadi ratings for importance of the vadose zone material shadi rating clay and metasedimentary rock 2 silt and crystalline rock 4 weathered basalt 6 sand 8 flood gravels 10 weighting factor depth to water subtract 1 for each confining layer up to 2 results from the application of shadi the product of the analysis of ground water susceptibility using shadi is a set of six maps maps one depict the characteristics of the environment considered by shadi map six is the susceptibility rating itself maps one are based on 1 existing mapped data 2 interpretation of well drillers logs and 3 a combination of the above soil and annual recharge are taken from the mapping contained in the spokane county soil survey donaldson and giese 1968 and annual precipitation maps prepared by the national weather service noaa 1990 these maps probably represent the range of resolution for the mapping the soil survey maps show variations in soil type for parcels as small as five acres annual precipitation at any given point in spokane county varies greatly from year to year the precipitation map and therefore the annual recharge map cannot show this variation the areas of equal annual recharge can move a mile to the east or west from year to year the resolution of the annual recharge map is good in the center of the ranges and poor at the edges this means that the resolution of this factor ranges from 640 acres to 2560 acres hydraulic conductivity is derived from tests on individual wells penetrating the various ground water bearing formations the distribution of hydraulic conductivity in the various ground water units is based on both the individual well information and the existing geology maps which delineate the areas in which aquifers with similar characteristics might be found given the level of detail in the geology maps the amount of individual well data used and the range of values for hydraulic conductivity employed in shadi the resolution of this mapping is estimated to be about 160 acres depth to water for most of the urbanizing area of the county is derived from special studies that show considerable detail the resolution of this characteristic for these areas is about 40 acres for the rest of the county the information for depth to water was derived in the same manner  city of liberty lake development  71 as hydraulic conductivity and thus has a resolution of about 160 acres importance of the vadose zone is based on a recently completed geologic map of spokane county johnson 1997 the resolution of this map is about 40 acres the geographic information system gis used a grid process to calculate the susceptibility rating the grid process divides the 5 source maps into squares that are the same size and positions throughout the whole county the values rate times weight of the stacked squares in all 5 layers are added together for the final susceptibility rating the grid process was programmed to use squares 300 feet on a side 21 acres shadi rating areas less than 40 acres in size were combined with adjacent areas to create the final shadi rating map aquifer susceptibility map shadi rating map revised to create aquifer susceptibility map the shadi rating map was revised to create the aquifer susceptibility map by adding additional areas to coordinate wellhead protection throughout spokane county the washington state department of health provided the data for wellhead protection coordination based on site specific well specific determination of susceptibility of contamination to wells the data includes designated wellhead protection areas and areas within 1000foot radius of group a community and group a community transient wells without reported plans as wellhead protection plans are completed for wells the 1000 foot radius placeholder will be replaced by the washington department of healthcertified wellhead protection

recharge areas uses and activities within designated wellhead protection areas subject to critical aquifer recharge area regulations are required to meet the standards for high aquifer susceptibility

appendix q8 of the document of the document states that individual purveyor contingency plans should be updated and approved by water purveyors elected officials every five years the contingency plan is currently outdated and the city may take the necessary steps in the future to update this plan or modify it to address the communitys future needs in order to reflect the current liberty lake community d  shoreline management consult with the city of liberty lake for more information on the citys adopted shoreline management program  city of liberty lake development  75 e  environmental conservation e1 transfer of development rights 106e2 conservation futures program 106e1 transfer of development rights a purpose the purpose of this section is to implement the comprehensive plan and encourage the protection of open spaces of development rights transfer of development rights tdr allows individuals to purchase and sell residential development rights from lands that provide a public benefit such lands include forest open space regional trails and habitat for threatened or endangered species landowners receive financial compensation without developing or selling their land and the public receives permanent preservation of the land transferred development rights can be used to build additional houses on other parcels in more appropriate areas within the city the program reduces the development potential in the sending area and transfers that development opportunity to a receiving area the sending area property owner is paid to keep the land undeveloped while the receiving area property buys the credit allowing additional development beyond what zoning allows in the receiving area the transfer of development rights tdr program should be implemented on a regional basis with participation from spokane county b determination of number of development rights the zoning of a parcel and its size are used to calculate the number of development rights that are attached to a parcel the acreage that can be used to determine the number of development rights is the area of the parcel minus the amount in submerged lands and any land being retained for development on site based on the zoning requirements the number of development rights that a particular parcel qualifies for will depend on the specifics of the situation and would be determined on a case by case basis during the qualification process c transfer authorized allowed development rights may be transferred from one portion of a property to another portion of the same property or from one property to another property a transfer of development rights shall not be approved unless it meets one or more of the criteria in 14 below and it conforms to subsections de 1 protection of critical areas either by dedication to the public or a land trust or by a nonrevocable conservation easement  or 2 dedication of land to the public for park or recreational purposes  or 3 the density transfer is used to develop a mix of single family and multifamily housing on the same property or development site d prohibited transfers development rights shall not be transferred from land proposed for street rightofway stormwater detention facilities private streets and similar areas which do not provide open space or recreational values to the public e transfer rules all density transfers shall conform to all of the following rules  city of liberty lake development  76 1 allowed housing units shall be transferred only to buildable lands receiving areas the number of allowed housing units shall be reduced on properties from which density is transferred sending areas based on the number of housing units transferred the new number of housing units allowed on the sending area shall be recorded on a deed for the property that runs with the land the deed shall state that the number of allowed housing units is subject to review and approval by the city in accordance with current zoning and development codes  2 the number of units which can be transferred is limited to the number of units which would have been allowed on 50 percent of the unbuildable area if not for these regulations  and 3 the total number of housing units per property or development site shall not exceed 100 percent of the maximum number of units per net acre permitted under the applicable comprehensive plan designation 4 all density transfer development proposals shall comply with the development standards of the applicable zoning district 106e2 conservation futures program a purpose and applicability conservation futures is a property tax on all lands within spokane county enabled by the washington state legislature in 1971 spokane county adopted and began a local program in 1994 spokane countys conservation futures program is intended to protect preserve maintain enhance restore limit the future use of or otherwise conserve selected open space land farmland forests wetlands wildlife habitats and other lands having significant recreational social scenic or aesthetic values within the boundaries of spokane county acquired properties will not be developed but kept in an enhanced natural area consistent with the revised washington rcw  as a jurisdiction within spokane county the city of liberty lake will participate in this program when possible conservation futures funds are used towards acquisition of property andor property easements that ensure public access and enjoyment of our greatest resources in perpetuity b program implementation the conservation futures program shall be implemented process adopted by the spokane county parks department the process includes 1 submittal of nomination  review by parks staff and recommendation of nominated sites for consideration by the lands subcommittee 3 holding of public meetings to review final nomination list 4 conducting property tours inspections and preparing evaluation scoring 5 preparation of the priority acquisition list and review by the spokane county parks advisory committee pac 6 final review and approval by board of county commissioners c evaluation criteria as outlined in the spokane county parks conservation futures implementation program the nomination submittal forms request certain types of information to assist the lands subcommittee in determining many key factors in assigning a point value to the property to assist the subcommittee in selecting the propertys that ensure public access and enjoyment of the greatest resources they will visit each site to evaluate the nominated  city of liberty lake development  77 property using a set list of standard quantitative criteria with a point system the criteria assigns points in considering the identified need for open space within the area whether the nominated property owners is willing to donate to an endowment fund for the long term maintenance of the property and does it contain any major environmental concerns evaluation criteria considers the size of the property its riparianwetland habitat andor corridor values or critical links to such along with the ability for the public to access water systems other questions address whether the property serves as a buffer to development the potential threat of loss to development and the degree of demonstrated public support for the acquisition the nominated property will be evaluated for its ease of access to the public and whether it will likely become a destination for various types of public uses  city of liberty lake development  78 f  flood damage prevention f1

structures constructed below the base flood level as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 3 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 4 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant   city of liberty lake development  81 c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5 variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from flood elevations should be quite rare 6 variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subparagraph 2 above and otherwise complies with paragraphs 1 3 and 4 of 106f3a of the general standards 7 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the permitted structure will be built with its lowest floor below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the

drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace the enclosed area should be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event the type of drainage system will vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics such as soil types possible options include natural drainage welldrained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means v the velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace for velocities in excess of

when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community d floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in 106f1b are areas designated as floodways since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that can carry debris and increase erosion potential the following provisions apply 1 prohibit encroachments including fill new construction substantial improvements and other development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase
