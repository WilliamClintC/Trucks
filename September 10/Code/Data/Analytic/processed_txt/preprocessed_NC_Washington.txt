governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council does ordain as follows a findings of fact 1 the floodprone areas within the jurisdiction of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in floodprone areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within floodprone areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and all other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands c objectives the objectives of this article are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business losses and interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities ie water and gas mains electric telephone cable and sewer lines streets and bridges that are located in floodprone areas  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas

section shall be known and may be cited as the interchange overlay district the city of washington b authority the state general statutes permit municipalities to establish overlay districts gs 160a382a c findings 1 highway interchanges and the areas that surround them are magnets for development traditionally lands near interchanges on limited access highways generate stronger development interest and command high prices these lands tend to be developed quickly for high revenueproducing activities in some cases developers attempt to maximize return on investment with little consideration to the longterm impact of their development on the surrounding community since the interchange areas are key gateways to the community design considerations in the area are critically important the area surrounding the interchanges should be subject to an overlay district that creates site design architecture signage parking landscaping and lighting standards more stringent than in other areas of the community 2 the city council finds that the interchange areas subject to regulation by this section have specific development pressures and unique conditions that are not found elsewhere in the city these unique conditions of greater traffic counts and more intensive development pressures justify regulation in specific areas of the city that would not be justifiable in other areas of the city due to the absence of such conditions d purpose and intent the purpose of this section is to encourage managed sensible interchange development by providing protective measures that promote safety minimize the impact to the natural environment and promote highway beautification this section is intended to ensure that new development will be compatible with respect to design signage lighting screening and access points it is not meant to recommend or dictate specific land uses within the area regulated rather it is intended to ensure that if development does occur within the area it will meet a minimum set of standards this section is also intended to help developments within the interchange area maintain their initial appeal by protecting them from potential adjacent

the number of signs a sign shall be considered to be single display surface or display device containing elements organized related and composed to form a unit where matter is displayed in a random manner without organized relationship of elements each element shall be considered a single sign b without limiting the generality of subsection a of this section a multisided sign shall be regarded as one 1 sign  computation of sign area a for the purpose of this article the area in square feet of any sign shall be computed by the smallest square triangle rectangle circle or combination thereof which will encompass the entire sign in computing the sign area in square feet standard mathematical formulas for known or common shapes will be used in the case of irregular shapes straight lines drawn closest to the extremities of the shape will be used b where a sign has two 2 or more faces the area of all faces shall be included in determining the area of the sign except that where two 2 such faces are placed backtoback and are at no point more than one and onehalf 1 12 feet from one another the area of the sign shall be taken as the area of the larger face if the two 2 faces are of unequal area  if the areas of the two 2 faces are equal then the area of one 1 of the faces shall be taken as the area of the sign  total allowable sign surface area a unless otherwise provided in this article the total surface area devoted to all signs on any lot shall not exceed the limitations set forth in this section and all signs except temporary signs shall be included in this calculation b unless otherwise provided in this article the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in any residential district is four 4 square feet in the rhd district the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot is two 2 square feet the maximum sign surface area allowed for approved home occupations is set out in section 40415e c subject to the other provisions of this article the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in a b1h district shall be five 5 percent of the area of the building facade plus twenty 20 percent of the area of the front display window however in no case may the total sign surface area exceed one hundred 100 square feet d subject to the other provisions of this section the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in an o and i or b4 district shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet of street frontage by seventyfive onehundredths 075 of a foot however in no case may the total sign surface area exceed two hundred 200 square feet e subject to the other provisions of this article the maximum sign surface area permitted on any lot in a b2 b3 i1 or i2 district shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet of street frontage of the lot by one and onehalf 1 12 feet however in no case may the total sign surface area exceed four hundred 400 square feet f within a planned unit development pud the maximum sign surface area permitted for each use shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet of street frontage of the development by one and onehalf 1 12 feet however in no case may the total sign surface area for each use exceed four hundred 400 square feet g if a lot has frontage on more than one 1 street then the total surface area permitted on that lot shall be the sum of the sign surface area allotments related to each street on which the lot has frontage however the total sign surface area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed the portion of the lots total sign surface area allocation that is derived from frontage on that street h whenever a lot is situated such that it has no street frontage on any lot boundary and an applicant desires to install on such a lot a sign that is oriented toward a street then the total sign surface area permitted on that lot shall be the sign surface area that would be allowed if the lot boundary closest to the street toward which such sign is to be oriented fronted on such street the applicant shall be restricted to using only one 1 street and the closest lot boundary to this street for determining the total permitted sign surface area however the applicant shall be given the opportunity to determine the one 1 street used in the calculation i the total sign area delineated in this section may be allocated among the various types of permissible signs at the discretion of the sign permit applicant however the maximum sign area allocated to any one 1 particular type of sign is outlined in sections 40411 and 40412 therefore the total sign area determined by this section may not be attained in some cases because of the sign area cap for individual freestanding or wall signs for example a use in the b1h district with one hundred 100 feet of lot frontage five hundred 500 square feet of building facade and a front display window area of fifty 50 square feet would be allowed a total sign area of thirtyfive 35 square feet a maximum wall sign of twentyfive 25 square feet 500 feet building facade surface area  5 percent 25 square feet and a maximum window sign of ten 10 square feet 50 feet display window area  20 percent 10 square feet would be allowed consequently the limited amount of building facade area in this case would prevent the total sign surface area from being attained the amount of total permissible sign area not utilized for freestanding and wall signs could however be applied to other types of allowable signs j the maximum sign surface area permitted in the ap zone shall be determined by multiplying the number of linear feet by onehalf 12 foot however in no case may the total sign area exceed one hundred 100 square feet    freestanding sign surface area a for purposes of this section a side of a freestanding sign is any plane or flat surface included in the calculation of the total sign surface area as provided in section 40409 for example wall signs typically have one 1 side freestanding signs typically have two 2 sides backtoback although foursided and other multisided signs are also common b subject to subsection c of this section a single side of a freestanding sign may not exceed onehalf 12 of a square foot in surface area for every linear foot of street frontage along the street toward which such sign is primarily oriented however in no case may a single side of a freestanding sign exceed two hundred 200 square feet c freestanding onpremises signs are permitted in the b1h district provided the single side of the sign shall not exceed twenty 20 square feet in area d with respect to freestanding signs that have no discernible sides such as spheres or other shapes not composed of flat planes no such freestanding sign may exceed the maximum surface area allowed under subsection b of this section for a single side of a freestanding sign    wall sign surface area a the sign surface area on any sign located on a wall of a structure may not exceed thirty 30 percent of the total surface area of the wall on which the sign is located b the sign surface area of any sign located on a wall of a structure on any lot within the b1h zoning district may not exceed five 5 percent of the total surface area of the wall on which the sign is located the sign surface of any wall sign mounted on a residential building including those put to commercial use shall be small less than one 1 square foot identification panels at the primary entrance c wall surface area is calculated by multiplying the vertical distance of the building wall measured at the average finished grade times the horizontal distance of the building wall  number of freestanding and wall signs a except as authorized by this section no lot may have more than one 1 freestanding sign b if a lot is located on a lot that has frontage on two 2 or more public streets then the lot may have not more than one 1 freestanding sign along each side of the lot bordered by such streets c no more than one 1 wall sign per establishment per street frontage is allowed    location and height requirements a no portion of any freestanding sign shall extend closer than two 2 feet to a street rightofway line or property line b no sign may extend above any parapet or be placed upon any roof surface except that for purposes of this section roof structures constructed at an angle of seventyfive 75 degrees or more from horizontal shall be regarded as wall space this subsection shall not apply to displays including lighting erected in connection with the observation of
