protect and increase the value of properties within the city  3 prohibit the indiscriminate clearing or clear cutting of property  4 maintain and enhance a positive image toward the city  5 prevent the unnecessary removal of protected trees and to provide for remediation where removal is unavoidable a1 replacement given the conduciveness of the citys topography and natural conditions to arboreal viability and in light of the minimum lot size requirements applicable to each lot in the city it is the further intent of this article to achieve the foregoing objectives by requiring the replacement of trees as specified in this article solely specific performance and not by imposing any tree mitigation fee or similar monetary charge b tree removal permit required it is unlawful for any person to remove or to intentionally or with criminal negligence cause serious damage to any protected tree within the city without having first obtained from the city a tree removal permit 1 removal in

submit to the building official a current tree survey and tree disposition and protection plan the city shall grant a tree removal permit if the applicant demonstrates that for each protected tree that is to be removed the removal is necessary in order to make a reasonable use of the site and that all alternatives to removal including redesign of the proposed improvements have been considered b restrictions on additional removals 1 where a permit is granted to remove protected trees in order to develop or construct a particular improvement on a site and the subject trees are actually removed no permit shall be granted for the removal of additional protected trees from the site for the construction of a similar improvement for a period of five years following the date the first permit was issued 2 for example if a permit is granted for the removal of trees for the construction of a proposed new residence and the property owner or his successor in title elects not to build that proposed residence any new proposed residence on the site must be designed to fit within the area from which protected trees have been removed and cannot require the removal of additional protected trees 3 the purpose of this provision is to prevent the unnecessary removal of protected trees based on speculative construction or development plans and to encourage property owners to seek removal of trees only when the proposed improvements will actually be constructed 4 for the purposes of this article the filing of an application for removal of protected trees for the construction of a particular improvement is deemed to be an admission by the applicant that a reasonable improvement of the type desired can be constructed on the site without removing any additional protected trees 2 other

general the city of hunters creek village is a fully developed residential community with a complementing business community one of its most important attributes is its ability to protect the integrity of its residential neighborhoods zoning ordinance and other land use regulations the city is located along with the other memorial villages in an area that is surrounded on all sides by the city of houston and is almost exclusively residential in character the only commercial activity in the city is located along the interstate 10 corridor which forms the northern boundary of the city the city and its residential community are served by commercial and industrial uses that are located in the city of houston and other neighboring cities and there is no need to expand the citys current business district the most important goal of this comprehensive plan is the preservation of the citys high quality residential neighborhoods and the protection of those neighborhoods from the negative effects of urban development residential zoning will be employed generally to maintain and improve the health safety morals and general welfare of the residents citizens and inhabitants of the city of hunters creek village by limiting population density land use lot size height and setbacks of buildings and other improvements and by regulating swimming pools parking fences and the use of signs and by enacting such other regulations as may be permitted by law zoning in the business districts will be employed generally to promote business activity while minimizing any adverse effects of commercial development on the residents citizens and inhabitants of the city of hunters creek village and providing a buffer zone between the business district and the residential district zoning

fences and the use of signs these neighborhoods will also be protected and improved by appropriate and timely investments in maintenance and replacement of public infrastructure any new development or redevelopment in the business districts along interstate 10 should be designed and located so as to minimize any adverse effect on existing residential uses and to ensure that new development constitutes a benefit to the citys residential neighborhoods ingress and egress to all development in the business district should be designed so that traffic to and from the development which originates in or is destined to points outside of the city of hunters creek village will not utilize local residential streets 3 business district b the area along interstate 10 is subject to substantial noise visual pollution air pollution and the heavy traffic associated with a major highway and transportation corridor the city will continue to exercise its regulatory authority to mitigate the negative effects of these factors on nearby residential areas any new development or redevelopment in the existing business district should be designed to be complimentary to the adjoining residential areas of the city and to mitigate any traffic water sewer flood or other conditions adverse to the community regulations should be tailored to encourage property owners to utilize their property to the maximum extent possible in order to produce adequate revenue to fund the cost to the city of providing necessary services 4 public services existing public services in the city are adequate to preserve the high quality of the citys residential neighborhoods and its small business district it is not anticipated that significant expansion andor upgrading of existing public facilities will be necessary in the future however the city will need to continue its program of periodic replacement of public facilities as those facilities reach their useful life present facilities in the business district are appropriate for maintenance or adequate service levels to business and commercial interests presently existing in the business districts any new development renovation or replacement of present businesses should be accomplished only if there is appropriate and adequate assurance that the proposed new development will provide sufficient upgrading renovation or addition of appropriate facilities necessary to serve such new development and otherwise not adversely impact present residential development or existing business development the citys forest canopy and existing green space contributes to the health safety and wellbeing of the residents of the city and to the overall quality of life within the city and efforts should be made to preserve existing trees and green space land use regulations and maintenance of public areas efforts should be made to educate and inform the citys residents on the benefits of maintaining the citys forest canopy and green space the city should encourage the development and maintenance of privately owned landscaped green areas in its residential neighborhoods additional hike and bike trails should be built and existing trails maintained to these ends citizen participation should be sought 5 traffic existing traffic circulation systems in the city should be maintained and be upgraded as needed with adequate repairs provided in order to insure good and serviceable streets every effort should be made to preserve the integrity of the residential neighborhoods within the city no zoning ordinance should be adopted which encourages arterial street circulation within the residential neighborhoods of the city 6 implementation the citys land use regulations should provide for protection of the rights and interests of neighboring landowners and the general public these rights and interests should be protected by controlling development which could create or significantly increase glare light shade traffic noise noxious fumes trash accumulation or rainwater runoff to other landowners every effort should be made by the city to encourage active participation by all citizens
