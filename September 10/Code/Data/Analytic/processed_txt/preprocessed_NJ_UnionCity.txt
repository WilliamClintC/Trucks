life serious bodily injury shall mean bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or that b the board of commissioners of the city of union city hereby finds based upon information provided by the chief of police that there has been a continued breakdown in the supervision and guidance normally provided by certain parents for juveniles under 18 years of age resulting in juveniles being involved in a wide range of unacceptable behavior during the late evening hours including vandalism noisy and rowdy behavior breaking and entering public drinking and littering and harassment of residents both as perpetrators and victims c the board of commissioners further finds that the offensive activities by and towards the juveniles are not easily controlled by existing laws and ordinances because the activities are easily concealed whenever police officers are present and the establishment of reasonable curfew regulations will enable the community to better control the free and unobstructed access to the streets and public places by the majority of residents and will enable the police to act reasonably and fairly to prevent the violation of laws and ordinances by juveniles d the board of commissioners further finds and has determined that a curfew meets a compelling local need and that curfew ordinances in other communities have been a significant factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency a curfew in union city is particularly appropriate in view of the high density of population in a relatively small geographic area in union city and the mixed use of residential and commercial areas throughout the city the regulation of juveniles is an attempt to minimize danger to the juveniles and the community during the dangerous hours for nocturnal crime and mischief which could be accentuated because of the juveniles immaturity e parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is an accepted norm by a substantial majority of the community and many parents have expressed a desire to have a curfew in order to augment their efforts to supervise and guide their children  1371 union city code  1372  causes death serious permanent disfigurement
