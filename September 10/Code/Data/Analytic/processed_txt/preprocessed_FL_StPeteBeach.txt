city    111594 legislative findings a the concerns raised in the whereas clauses listed in are incorporated in this article by reference b the concerns raised in the findings incorporated by reference in subsection a of this section raise substantial governmental concerns c adult use establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns d a reasonable and simple licensure procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of the adult use establishments further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the owneroperator to see that the adult use establishment is run in a manner that is consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual owneroperator of the adult use establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and the activities occurring therein e adult use establishments are a pervasively regulated industry making reasonable inspections and administrative searches necessary to enforce regulatory standards in particular the city commission finds 1 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting in adult theaters advances the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring at adult theaters 2 the prevention of sexual contact between patrons and employees at adult use establishments is unrelated to the suppression of free expression but serves to address the concerns raised in the findings contained in this section although the dancers erotic message may be slightly less effective from three feet away the ability to engage in the protected expression is not significantly impaired 3 separating dancers from patrons and prohibiting dancers and patrons from engaging in sexual fondling and caressing in adult cabarets would reduce the opportunity for prostitution transactions and thus should deter prostitution 4 the barring of nudity in public places furthers a substantial governmental interest in protecting order and morality this does not deprive one of freedom of expression of whatever erotic message conveyed  it simply makes the message slightly less graphic 5 requiring that the facilities of adult theaters be constructed of materials that are easily cleanable that the facilities be cleaned on a regular basis and that the employees cleaning the facilities take reasonable precautions to avoid contact with possible disease transmitting media is reasonably related to the protection of both employees and patrons from sexually transmitted diseases 6 requiring licensees of adult use establishments to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 7 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the adult use establishment is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses in a manner as to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and to reduce or eliminate the criminal activity associated with adult uses establishments 8 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases and in the investigation of criminal activity to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who either engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or are likely to be witnesses to such activity 9 a substantial rational relationship between sexually oriented businesses and sexually related crimes establishes a compelling justification for barring those prone to such crimes from the management of such businesses 10 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to a rational inference that the applicant is more likely to engage in conduct in contravention of this article 11 the barring of a person from participating in an adult use business shall cease when circumstances are indicated to the city that such persons are no longer criminally inclined 12 barring of such individuals from management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and to the promotion of that criminal activity associated with adult uses 13 because the weight of evidence shows that while adult bookstoresvideo stores which only sell or rent adult material and have no adult booththeater component have similar secondary effects as other adult uses such bookstores do not promote the transmission of sexual diseases an exemption of such limited adult establishments from the licensure requirements but not the locational requirements of this article is appropriate f the city commission desires to simplify the finding of all adult entertainment establishment regulations by combining them into one portion of the is contained in this article this will enable the city to provide a copy of all adult entertainment establishment related legislation by reference to one article of this order to ensure compliance with all requirements for enactment of

shall be based on the impact a development has on a transportation facility as determined by a traffic impact analysis that assesses the volume of traffic generated by the proposed development 2 a facility shall be considered impacted when the net trips generated by the proposed development meets or exceeds five percent of the facilitys peak hour capacity 3 should the impacted facility be operating at an los that meets the locally adopted los standard it would not be eligible for the application of proportionate fair share provisions 4 should the impacted facility be operating at a substandard los based on existing conditions or as a result of the impacts of a proposed development the facility would be identified as eligible for proportionate fair share provisions and the applicant would be notified as such 5 proportionate fairshare mitigation for concurrency impacts may include without limitation separately or collectively private funds contributions of land and construction and contribution of facilities 6 a development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fairshare the fair market value of the proportionate fairshare mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation 7 the methodology used to calculate an applicants proportionate fairshare obligation shall be as provided for in fs  12 as follows the cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume msv of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted los multiplied by the construction cost at the time of developer payment of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted los or proportionate fairshare   sdevelopment trips sub sub   sv increase sub sub  x cost sub sub  where development trips sub sub    those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment i and have triggered a deficiency per the cms  sv increase sub sub    service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment i  cost sub sub    adjusted cost of the improvement to segment i cost shall include all improvements and associated costs such as design rightofway acquisition planning engineering inspection and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred 8 for the purposes of determining proportionate fairshare obligations the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the mpo transportation improvement program where such information is not available improvement cost shall be determined using one of the methods described below a an analysis by the city of construction costs that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually  or b the most recent issue of fdot transportation costs as adjusted based upon the type of crosssection urban or rural  locally available data from recent projects on acquisition drainage and utility costs  and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted fdot work program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the fdot district 9 the value of a proportionate fair share mitigation project proposed by the applicant and accepted by the city shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this subsection 10 the city may also accept rightofway dedication for the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication shall be based on fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the estimated total

contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees consistent with the terms of the impact fee section of section 416 of the land development 2 impact fee credits for the proportionate fairshare contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fairshare agreement as they become due per the impact fee section of section 416 of the land development the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation is less than the developments anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city e proportionate fairshare agreements  1 upon execution of a proportionate fairshare agreement the applicant shall receive transportation concurrency approval or functional equivalent should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit in accordance with section 2941 then the agreement shall be considered null and void and the applicant shall be required to reapply 2 payment of the proportionate fairshare contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable if the payment is submitted more than 12 months from the date of execution of the agreement then the proportionate fairshare cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment pursuant to section 2911c and adjusted accordingly 3 all proportionate fair share mitigation improvements authorized under this subsection must be completed prior to issuance of a development permit or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements it is the intent of this subsection that any required improvements be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy 4 dedication of necessary rightofway for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fairshare agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat 5 any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fairshare contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation 6 applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fairshare agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement 7 the city may enter into proportionate fairshare agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility f appropriation of fairshare revenues  1 proportionate fairshare revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the cie or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fairshare agreement proportionate fairshare revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fairshare revenues were derived proportionate fairshare revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the fdot transportation regional incentive program trip 2 in the event a scheduled proportionate fair share improvement is removed from the cie then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within the same corridor or planning sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of section 2911a2b 3 where an impacted facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fairshare contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the fdot trip such coordination shall be ratified by the city interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking the developer contributions for this purpose 4 where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds their proportionate fairshare obligation calculated under section 2911c7 the city shall reimburse them for the excess contribution using one or more of the following methods a an impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the city b an account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fairshare payments from future applicants on the facility c the city may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution or some combination of means acceptable to the city and the applicant g cross jurisdictional impacts  1 in the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency the city may enter into an agreement with one or more adjacent local governments to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on multijurisdictional transportation facilities the agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this subsection to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development 2 a development application submitted subject to transportation concurrency requirements and meeting all of the criteria listed below shall be subject to this subsection a all or part of the proposed development is located within an area or corridor designated by an adjacent local government where development projects are subject to transportation concurrency requirements in accordance with their respective land development codes b if the additional traffic from the proposed development would use five percent or more of the adopted peak hour los maximum service volume of a multijurisdictional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of the adjacent local government impacted multijurisdictional facility c the impacted multijurisdictional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard adopted by the adjacent local government when the traffic from the proposed development is included 3 upon identification of an impacted multijurisdictional facility the city shall notify the applicant and the affected adjacent local government in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fairshare contribution based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility 4 the adjacent local government shall have up to 90 days in which to notify the city of a proposed specific proportionate fairshare obligation and the intended use of the funds when received the adjacent local government must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of fs   should the adjacent local government decline proportionate fairshare mitigation under this subsection then the provisions of this subsection would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair share requirements of the city 5 if the subject application is subsequently approved by the city the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application evidence that the proportionate fairshare obligation to the adjacent local government has been satisfied exh a 2282017 concurrency
