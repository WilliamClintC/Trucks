bioretention areas or rain gardens and are designed for conveyance only shallow slopes are effective steep slopes result in rapid travel and less filtration check for or consider installing dams that may enhance pollutant removal they are primarily used for small sites and may not be effective on larger sites choosing the proper landscaping is critical to the performance of a bioswale select native vegetation with deep root structures select species that withstand the frequent and substantial water flow plants that can tolerate both wet and dry conditions may work best consider the flow path to maximize conveyance bioswales may be more linear or curvaceous depending on site characteristics design the planting layout to allow for easy access and to facilitate periodic removal of sediments without significant disruption or removal of plant materials a lack of consideration for these details can lead to failed plantings and site flooding 4 standard of maintenance a swale areas
