the town council of the town of hillsborough does find that a numerous scientific studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor pollution  b reliable scientific studies including studies by the surgeon general of the united states and studies commissioned and assessed by the us environmental protection agency have shown that breathing sidestream or secondhand smoke is a significant health hazard to nonsmokers  particularly to children and teens elderly people individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease  c health hazards induced by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke include lung and other forms of cancer respiratory infection decreased respiratory function decreased exercise tolerance bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm and that the most common cause of premature death from environmental tobacco smoke is heart disease  d reliable scientific studies assessed by the us environmental protection agency have found that sidestream and secondhand tobacco smoke causes the death of at least fiftythree thousand nonsmokers annually and is a leading cause of premature death and disability among nonsmokers  e nonsmokers with allergies respiratory diseases and those who suffer other ill effects of breathing sidestream or secondhand tobacco smoke may experience a loss of job productivity or may be forced to take periodic sick leave because of adverse reactions to same  f persons particularly employees have a right to a smokefree environment if they desire  g tobacco smoking is a leading cause of fires in addition cigarette and cigar burns and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures cause economic losses to businesses  h substantial scientific evidence exists that the direct use of tobacco products causes cancer heart disease and various other medical diseases the surgeon general of the us has found that tobaccocaused diseases are the leading cause of premature preventable death and disability in the us  i the national centers for disease control have found that at least four hundred thirtyfour thousand americans die each year from tobaccocaused diseases the surgeon general of the us and us department of health and human services have found that a majority of those americans who die of tobaccocaused diseases became addicted to nicotine in tobacco products as adolescents before the age of legal consent  j the national institute on drug abuse has concluded that the nicotine in tobacco products is a powerful addictive drug and identifies nicotine addiction as the most widespread example of drug dependence in the us  and k the surgeon general of the us has found that nicotine in tobacco products is as addictive as cocaine and heroin  l ecigarettes are battery operated devices that generally use liquid cartridges filled with nicotine flavors and other chemicals ecigarettes convert liquid nicotine which is a known neurotoxin and highly addictive substance into chemically impregnated gas that is inhaled by a user simulating smoking  and m some ecigarette cartridges claim not to contain nicotine but there is no regulatory program to monitor this assertion and no way for the town to determine which cartridges may or may not contain nicotine accordingly the city council finds and declares that the purposes of this chapter are  to protect public health safety and general welfare by prohibiting the use of tobacco products and ecigarettes in enclosed areas in the town of hillsborough which are owned or leased by the town or otherwise used by the town of hillsborough  and  to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe tobacco smokefree air and to recognize that the need to breathe tobacco

level of potable water usage or other natural disaster or event that requires reductions in water usage the city council may implement revenue stabilization factors to adjust the rates of the volume charge the revenue stabilization factors to be implemented will be determined on the basis of the level of potable water use reduction required and the revenue required by the water utility to ensure that it recovers sufficient revenue to meet its expenditures and debt obligations the city council may terminate the revenue stabilization factor if no longer required if implemented by the city council the revenue stabilization factors will be applied to the rates of the volume charge the formula for the revenue stabilization factors is comprised of a conservation and a variable cost component the conservation component adjusts the volume charge rates to account for the reduction in water usage caused by conservation the variable component adjusts the rates for the volume charge to account for the towns specific water shortage conditions the rates for the volume charge then in effect will be multiplied by the applicable revenue stabilization factor to derive the volume charge

connection to the sewer main must be removed and replaced with a section of new pipe per the towns standards  6112012 private sewer laterals   purpose the purpose of this chapter is to establish responsibilities and requirements of the town and individual property owners for the inspection and repair of private sewer laterals which are determined to be causing or contributing to sanitary sewer overflows it describes the steps the town will be taking to reduce or eliminate infiltration and inflow coming from defective laterals it also describes incentives that will be offered by the town to encourage homeowners to rehabilitate their sewer laterals and it revises the hillsborough municipal necessary to clarify what will be required when homeowners or private contractors do sewer lateral rehabilitation work  6112012   background a inflow and infiltration i&i into the hillsborough public sewer system is a serious public health problem that needs to be addressed systemwide excess flows during periods of wet weather and high ground water levels have been overwhelming existing collection and treatment facilities resulting in sanitary sewer overflows ssos and releases of raw sewage to san francisco bay b infiltration from leaking private sewer laterals and connections of private laterals to the public sewer mains is a substantial source of excess flow volume video inspections of private sewer laterals have shown that older laterals commonly have some degree of damage c in addition to the increased flow volume due to infiltration leaking private sewer lateral pipes and connections to the public sewer mains allow intruding roots to build up and cause blockages that result in ssos at lateral cleanouts and at upstream manholes d during periods of dryer weather leaking sewer laterals allow exfiltration of raw sewage to contaminate the surrounding ground and to leach down into the underlying aquifer e smoke testing has demonstrated that inflow from direct connections between rainwater collection systems and private sewer laterals is another substantial cause of excess flows during periods of wet weather f the town owns and operates a sanitary sewer collection system that is regulated by statewide general waste discharge requirements order no 20060003 dwq the order also referred to as the general sanitary sewer overflow waste discharge requirements general sso wdr prohibits sanitary sewer overflows ssos that result in a discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater to waters of the united states or that creates a nuisance as defined in cwc m additionally the regional water quality control board rwqcbs water quality control plan for the san francisco bay basin prohibits the discharge of raw sewage or any waste failing to meet waste discharge requirements to any waters of the basin g from january 2003 the town experienced 89 sso events in violation of the above regulations the sso events occurred during wet weather and resulted from rainfall entering the towns defective sewer mains and defective privately owned sewer laterals in response to these events and ongoing ssos during wet weather the town of hillsborough was issued a cease and desist order cdo by the california regional water quality control board on  the cdo requires the elimination of ssos it includes requirements and provisions to resolve the causes of ssos in order to eliminate sewage discharges to storm drains surface waters and ground water of the state and the united states h in accordance with the cdo requirements the town has developed a comprehensive plan to eliminate ssos in addition to rehabilitating andor replacing defective public sewers the plan encourages the repair and rehabilitation of privately owned sewer laterals i throughout most of the town ssos can be eliminated combination of system capacity increases and elimination of i&i in one subbasin that drains into a trunk main that cannot be increased in capacity the only option for reducing ssos is to reduce peak discharges by eliminating i&i this subbasin will constitute the initially scheduled phase of the comprehensive program to rehabilitate sewer drainage subbasins throughout the town  6112012   definitions a city engineer means the city engineer of the town of hillsborough or hisher designated agent b cleanout means a pipe fitting and associated piping connected to a sewer pipeline that provides access to the line for purposes of flushing rodding cleaning and other maintenance and diagnostic purposes cleanouts are required at

sewer lateral is comprised of two distinct sections 1 lower sewer lateral  means the portion of a sewer lateral extending from the proximity of the property line or rightofway line or the edge of the easement to the publicly owned sewer system including the cleanout at its upstream end and the connection to the sewer main at its downstream end 2 upper sewer lateral means the portion of the sewer

public sewer main the provisions of this ordinance apply to all private laterals connected to it b a townwide rehabilitation of sewer mains and private laterals will be implemented on the basis of sewer drainage subbasins prioritized by the city engineer according to their volume of i&i in addition from time to time individual sewer mains elsewhere in town may be fully rehabilitated if they are too badly degraded for spot repairs to be costeffective c when a public sewer main is rehabilitated the town at its own cost will upgrade the lower laterals as necessary and will install or upgrade the cleanouts at the edges of the public right of way or easement as needed at that time the town will evaluate the upper laterals and if deficiencies are identified the owners of properties with

costs d because the problem of i&i is of such severity and importance every property owner or resident shall allow access to the towns personnel or contractors to conduct the testing and inspections described below they will be asked to minimize their use of their sewer lateral while the work is underway e individual properties are already required to have their laterals upgraded upon certain transfers of title as described in the hillsborough municipal an owner has upgraded their lateral program they will be exempted from that requirement for a number of years as described below f smoke or dye testing 1 in order to locate sources of inflow and infiltration as defined below the town will systematically test private sewer laterals by pumping lowpressure nontoxic smoke into isolated segments of public sewer mains and then observing where the smoke is released on the properties with laterals feeding into that segment properly installed plumbing and storm drainage fixtures will not allow the smoke to escape into the structures served 2 prior to conducting a smoke test the owners and residents of the affected properties will be notified with written explanations of what is to be done and what they should do to prepare for it they will be provided with contact information for obtaining additional information or answers to specific questions information will also be posted on the towns website 3 when a segment of sewer main is being tested the towns personnel or contractors will need to thoroughly examine each property with laterals connected to that segment the inspectors will observe the grounds between the sewer main and all structures as well as the area around each structure they will photograph and make note of any smoke observed at any locations on the grounds and particularly at drains and roof gutters 4 if necessary to confirm a source of inflow a nontoxic dye may be poured into a suspected source while an observer at a downstream manhole watches for it the dye used for this is nonpolluting and has no harmful effects on the system 5 if illegal sources of inflow are observed the property owner shall be required to correct the conditions g video inspections of private laterals by the towns contractors 1 when the town rehabilitates a segment of public sewer main the private laterals connected to it will be examined at the same time unless they are specifically exempted as provided in  prior to examining a lateral the owner and residents of the property will be notified with written explanations of what is to be done and what they should do to prepare for it they will be provided with contact information for obtaining additional information or answers to specific questions information will also be posted on the towns website 3 a closed circuit television cctv camera designed specifically for this purpose will be inserted into the lateral from wherever access can be obtained ie a cleanout or a roof vent and a digital video record will be made of the inspection 4 if a proper twoway cleanout see the definitions section above does not currently exist at the property line or the edge of the easement the town will have one installed  during that procedure the lateral above and below that point will be videoinspected 5 if a lateral is too badly clogged for a reliable video inspection an attempt may be made to clean it 6 the digital video showing any defects and their measured locations will be shared with the property owner and the owner will be informed of their responsibilities regarding the upper portion as well as the incentives offered by the town program  6112012   standards a when private sewer laterals are repaired or rehabilitated they must be inspected and approved by the town inspection shall consist of external visual examination by a town inspector during construction and a closed circuit television cctv inspection of the interior recorded on digital video final approval shall be contingent upon passing a pressure test as described in the california plumbing standards for visual approval of a sewer lateral any of the following may be cause for failure and require correction 1 intrusion of roots 2 offsets of more than half the pipe wall thickness at joints 3 cracks clearly evident in video 4 any breaks or holes wall 5 excessive corrosion of iron pipe 6 interior spalling of vitrified clay pipe 7 tears holes or loose edges of previously applied pipe liners 8 accumulations of grease encrustations sediment or any debris or material that could not be removed by conventional cleaning 9

point where the pipe enters the structure and at the property line or easement line as well as intermediately at branches changes of direction and along long laterals as required or lack of any other required backflow prevention or overflow device in good working condition 12 nonwatertight connections between the lateral and the sewer main as indicated by root intrusion visible gaps or cracks in the main adjacent to the connection 13 the lateral protruding into the sewer main beyond the mains inner surface c video inspection standards 1 the television camera used shall be one specifically designed and constructed for such inspection it must have integrated lighting and be capable of producing a clear image in reasonably accurate color even when submerged or operating in one hundred

continuous a motion as practicable without skipping any portions of the pipe at no greater than thirty feet per minute it shall be stopped at any observed features such as joints defects branch connections or irregularities of any kind and shall be slowly advanced back and forth as needed to provide as full a view of the feature as possible the video shall show the area around the point of entry of the camera in order to confirm the location as well as a clear image of the cleanout or the sewer main at the end of the survey 4 the video shall include a text description of the time date and direction of the survey and the address of the property inspected  the metered length of the survey must be accurately displayed on the video as the survey progresses if full inspection of a private lateral or branched lateral system is done in multiple surveys the specific location of each video shall be clearly identified 5 the video must include an accompanying audio track containing descriptive comments from the operator 6 digital recordings submitted to the town must be in a format that can be read by the towns computers running microsoft windows operating systems and windows

owners 3 properties owned by partnerships or corporations for properties owned by partnerships or corporations including properties with structures occupied by one or multiple tenants responsibility for compliance with this title shall fall upon the party or parties responsible for ownership e in situations where more than one property share a common private lateral the property owners shall equally share responsibility for work required on the shared portion and shall be individually responsible for work required on their separate portions individual cleanouts shall be installed just above each connection to a shared lateral if feasible  6112012   responsibilities of the town a when the town performs i&i rehabilitation on a segment of a sewer main it will also repair or rehabilitate all of the lower laterals as needed including the cleanouts proximate to the property lines rightofway lines or easement lines b when the town inspects and repairs or replaces if necessary the lower portion of a lateral the town will also evaluate the upper portion of the lateral unless evidence satisfactory to the city engineer is provided that documents that the upper lateral has been newly installed has been fully replaced in accordance with town standards within the preceding five years or the property owner has a current compliance certificate c if the towns inspection of an upper lateral indicates the need for repair or replacement the town will notify the property owner of the owners responsibilities under the hillsborough municipal will provide documentation of the conditions that require attention the contractor performing work for the town will be directed to provide the owner with a price quote for the necessary work d the town will maintain a list of plumbing contractors known to be qualified to perform the work although providing names from that list to a property owner shall not be construed as recommendations or endorsements of those contractors e if the property owner chooses to contract with the towns contractor the town shall not participate in any way in that agreement or that work other than to inspect the work as it would with any other contractor doing private improvements if the owner chooses to have the work done by anyone else they may not begin until the towns work at the cleanout and downstream to the main is completed including backfilling any excavations on the subject property f the town will waive permit fees for repair or replacement work done on an upper lateral if it is done by the contractor working for the town rehabilitating the lower lateral andor cleanout or if it is completed by another contractor within ninety days of completion of work on the lower lateral andor cleanout  6112012   private lateral compliance certification process a general provisions 1 a private sewer lateral for which a compliance certificate has been granted shall be exempted from the testing and inspection

certificate at any time other than when the town is rehabilitating the public sewer main serving the property the owner shall provide documentation demonstrating compliance or shall arrange for a pressure test to be conducted  the pressure test must be observed and approved by the towns inspector 3 after a fully repaired or replaced private sewer lateral has been inspected and has passed the required tests and has been approved by the town or after satisfactory evidence has been provided documenting that the lateral was newly and legally installed within the previous five years a compliance certificate with a term described below will be issued to the property owner 4 if a compliance certificate had already been obtained prior to the towns rehabilitation of a public sewer main it will continue to run its original term b term of compliance certificate 1 new or entirely replaced lateralstwenty years from the date of installation 2 repaired laterals or existing laterals that pass an approved pressure testten years 3 if evidence satisfactory to the city engineer is provided that documents that the upper lateral had been newly installed or fully replaced in accordance with

development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of  part 1999  692014   variance procedure a the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the town to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b in passing upon requests for variances the town shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter 1 in addition the town shall consider the following specific factors a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges 2 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency c the conditions for granting variances hereunder are as follows 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required to issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the town need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the town believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinances 5 variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this ordinance to the applicant  and c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in this chapter see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in this chapter of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of c1 c5 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 7 upon consideration of the factors of b1 and the purposes of this chapter the town may attached such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter d the issuance of a variance under this section is for floodplain management purposes only part 1999  692014 swimming pool safety barriers barriers every swimming pool hot tub andor spa constructed after  shall be protected by barriers to prevent unauthorized entry into the pool hot tub andor spa such barriers shall be of the type described in and otherwise comply with

the current requirements of this chapter shall not be required to meet them  provided however that if any such lot is proposed to be subdivided the subdivision shall be required to meet the requirements of this chapter  hillside lot size   intent the intent of this chapter is to regulate land in hillside areas with an average slope of ten percent or greater in order to accomplish one or more of the following a to substantially maintain essential natural features vegetation open space and scenic qualities b to minimize water runoff and soil erosion problems incurred in adjustment of the terrain in order to meet onsite and offsite development needs c to achieve land use densities that are in keeping with the general plan d to insure that the town does not incur an extraordinary or substantial increase in the cost of providing or maintaining public services e to encourage the use of development techniques and alternatives that will be compatible with the terrain    definitions a hillside land means land having an average percent of slope equal to or exceeding ten percent calculated pursuant to b contour interval means the difference in elevation between adjacent contour lines on a topographical map    conflict notwithstanding any other provision of this code regarding minimum lot size each lot on hillside land shall be no smaller than the minimum lot size determined pursuant to this chapter    average percent of slope a for purposes of this title the average percent of slope of a parcel being subdivided or of a single lot shall be determined by the formula s   100 ila where s   average percent of slope i   contour interval in feet l   summation of existing contour length in feet a   area of lot in square feet b the application of this formula is as follows example topographic map percent slope  sample calculations contour interval i   5 from the topographic map above summation length of contours l calculated in feet and measured from the topographic map

map shall indicate two foot vertical intervals at a minimum and shall be of a size adequate to allow the calculations required by this chapter to be done    calculation of number and size of lots permitted a for proposed subdivisions of hillside land the calculation of the number and size of lots shall be done in two steps first using the slope formula set forth in calculate the average slope percent for the whole parcel proposed to be subdivided second compare this calculated average slope percent to column 1 of the slopedensity table below and determine the maximum number of lots per acre column 2 of the slopedensity table and the minimum lot size for the subdivision column 3 of the slopedensity table if the average slope percent falls between the numbers shown in column 1 the numbers for all three columns shall be interpolated for example if the average slope percent in column 1 is 175% the density in column 2 is 170 and the minimum lot size in column 3 is 59 slopedensity table column 1 average slope percent calculated per  column 2 density acre column 3 minimum lot size less than 10 200 50 10 185 54 15 175 57 20 165 61 25 150 67 30 125 80 35 100 100 40 075 133 more than 40 050 200 b the maximum number of lots allowed for any proposed subdivision shall be calculated by multiplying the subdivisions total acreage by the density allowed by column 2 if the resulting number of lots permitted is not a whole number the number of lots permitted shall be rounded up to the next higher whole number if each resulting lot can individually satisfy the minimum lot size set forth in column 3  otherwise the number of lots permitted shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number in other words in all cases the lot size for each lot in the proposed subdivision shall be no smaller than the minimum lot size allowed by column 3 c the calculations required by this section are illustrated as follows sample lot calculation assume a 5 acre parcel with 175% average slope this means that column 1   175 column 2   170 interpolated column 3   059 interpolated this means that 170   density per acre of the proposed 5 acre subdivision 170 density  5 acres   85 lots maximum 85 lots rounds up to 9 lots however each individual lot must meet the requirements of column 3 ie must be at least 59 acres in size nine lots at the minimum lot size 9 lots @ 59 acres   531 acres total exceed the size of the 5 acre site so only 8 lots maximum 8 lots @ 59 acres   472 acres total may be allowed in the proposed subdivision d frontage and other requirements of this and other titles may also affect the maximum number of lots possible in a proposed subdivision and may increase the minimum lot size otherwise applicable to lots on hillside land nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to make such other requirements inapplicable  subdivision approval process   outline of subdivision approval process a the subdivision approval process is outlined below in general terms of necessity there are many details and requirements not listed here the omission of which shall not be interpreted as making them inapplicable nothing in this section shall be deemed to require or commit the city council or the town to approve any application map environmental assessment or other document or to limit the city council or the town in any way except as otherwise required by law or to supersede or vary the requirements of the california environmental quality act ceqa the subdivision map act or any other applicable law b the subdivision approval process in summary consists of the following steps step 1 conceptual review is conducted as set forth in if applicable step 2 the applicant submits a tentative map application to the city engineer the applicant also submits to the director of building and planning a final environmental information form and any studies or additional environmental information required step 3 the city engineer prepares a staff report step 4 the initial study and environmental assessment are conducted and the most appropriate ceqa document relating to the proposed application will be prepared as directed by the director of building and planning step 5 the architecture and design review board holds a public hearing to review the design of the subdivision and any designrelated issues step 6 the city council holds a public hearing and considers the environmental assessment document prepared for compliance with california environmental quality act ceqa and will either adopt approve or reject the document if the ceqa document is approved or adopted the city council will then hold a public hearing and consider the tentative map application this hearing may be noticed and held at the same time as the certification and adoption of the ceqa document but the actions of the council are separate the tentative map application will not be considered without approval or certification of the environmental compliance document step 7 the city council reviews the final map and the required subdivision improvements step 8 the city council approved denies or conditionally approves the application based on the findings outlined in the state subdivision map act step 9 the applicant submits the final map application to the city engineer with all other required documents bonds and security instruments    conceptual review in addition to the subdivision approval process required under the subdivision map act and outlined in subdivisions shall be subject to a conceptual review prior to submission of a tentative map the conceptual review requires review of a conceptual plan together with the preliminary environmental analysis and is intended to facilitate optimum subdivision design reduce unproductive effort by all concerned and bring about a better result for applicants the town residents and the city council the early conceptual review also aids in the identification of potential environmental issues preparation of an environmental assessment and preparation of an acceptable proposed tentative map    conceptual plandefinition a conceptual plan consists of the applicants proposal for potentially subdividing the property in question indicating possible numbers and boundaries of lots possible improvements on the lots including but not limited to retaining walls grading quantities location of proposed building pads and any other sloperelated features possible ways in which public services may be provided possible access locations and possible ways of dealing with the major physical characteristics of the property in question all indicated in relatively preliminary conceptual terms    preliminary environmental analysisdefinition the preliminary environmental analysis is the towns preliminary review of the conceptual plan and the environmental information form submitted by the applicant and other environmental issues identified during the conceptual review process    when required a conceptual plan and conceptual review shall be required for all subdivisions    public hearing and city council response a the following documents and fee shall be filed with the planning department to begin the preliminary review process 1 completed and signed conceptual plan application on the proper form 2 conceptual plan application fee in the amount set from time to time by resolution of the city council 3 a current title guaranty report or letter by a title company verifying applicants ownership as required by if the applicant is not the current owner of the property a consent letter from the property owner approving the application is required 4 completed environmental information form 5 completed conceptual plan with the prescribed attachments consistent with the application requirements 6 any additional information specific to the site that is required by the city engineer or the director of building and planning 7 proof of legality of the existing lots 8 the conceptual review fee in effect at the time the application is submitted b the city council shall hold a public hearing noticed per type a notice and review the preliminary environmental analysis prepared by the planning staff the report of the city engineer and the conceptual plan prepared and presented by the applicant c after receiving the staff reports and public testimony at the hearing the city council shall provide preliminary comments to the applicant regarding issues relating to the subdivisions design including but not limited to the number location and configuration of the lots the location of buildable sites on the lots the access to the lots the handling of any significant topographical or geologic features the treatment of trees and other vegetation in the subdivision concerns identified by the public and any other relevant comments  park inlieu fees   purpose the purpose of this chapter is to mitigate the impacts of property development and implement action 12 of the towns open space and conservation element of the general plan by requiring developers of new subdivisions to pay park inlieu fees that will be used to develop new or rehabilitate existing neighborhood or community park or recreational facilities that serve the proposed subdivision    payment of fee a no final subdivision map shall be approved nor shall it be recorded unless in connection therewith a fee in lieu of land within the subdivision to be dedicated to the town for park or recreational purposes has been paid which fee shall be determined in accordance with the standards and in the manner set forth in this chapter b in the event that final map approval does not occur within six months after receipt of payment the amount of the fee shall be recalculated the recalculated fee shall be determined using the fee schedule in effect at the time of final map approval the additional fee if any shall be paid in accordance with subsection a of this section before the final map is submitted for approval    calculation of inlieu fee to be paid a the calculation of the inlieu fee can be illustrated by the following example 1 a tenacre subdivision will be subdivided into eight lots 2 each lot will be inhabited by 29 people which is the average number of people per household in town according to the latest census 3 therefore the eightlot subdivision will add a total of 232 people 8  29   232 to the towns population 4 each of the 232 additional people needs 003 acre of additional parkrecreation land this 003 figure being established by state law and the towns general plan 5 therefore the 232 additional people will need a total of  acre 232  003    of additional parkrecreation land 6 if the average cost of an acre of unimproved land in the town is one million one hundred thousand dollars this number is used for illustration only  see how the average cost will be calculated for any given year then the cost of providing  acre for the 232 additional people is seventysix thousand five hundred sixty dollars $1100000 x    $76560 which is the amount of the inlieu fee b the formula for calculating the inlieu fee for a subdivision is illustrated as follows a  003  b  c   amount of inlieu fee when a   the number of lots within the subdivision and b   the cost of one acre of unimproved land as determined under c   average number of persons per house hold according to the latest census    cost of one acre of unimproved land a the cost of one acre of unimproved land shall be calculated annually each spring by adding i the total sales price per acre of every unimproved parcel of land in the town sold in the previous two calendar years adjusted to include the estimated cost of any subdivision improvements required but not yet installed plus ii the total sales price per acre of every teardown in the town sold in the previous two calendar years a teardown being defined in subsection a1c of the hillsborough municipal  and then calculating the average sales price per acre of all such sales the average so calculated shall be the cost of one acre of unimproved land for purposes of this chapter b the schedule of fees adopted by the town for each fiscal year shall include the cost of one acre of unimproved land calculated according to subsection a of this section for the twocalendaryear period immediately preceding the fiscal year    use of inlieu fees a the fees paid pursuant to this chapter in connection with a particular subdivision may be used only for the purpose of providing new or rehabilitating existing park or recreational sites and facilities located anywhere in the town that will serve such subdivision and the future residents therein such sites and facilities shall comply with the principles and standards set forth in the general plan approved and adopted by the city council b any fees collected under this chapter if not sooner expended as set forth herein shall be committed to a dedicated capital improvement fund within five years after i the payment of the inlieu fees or ii the issuance of building permits on onehalf of the lots created by the subdivision whichever occurs later  tentative maps   when required a tentative map and a
