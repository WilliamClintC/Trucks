citys effort to create a vibrant retail office and residential district in the city center district benefits of this effort will include increased tax base in historic properties stabilization and improvement of existing businesses job creation and the improvement of the aesthetic qualities of this unique architectural resource the city center district is divided by the allegheny river into two distinct areas each with its own historic character  city center district  north side of the allegheny river on the north side of the allegheny river the commercial buildings generally date from the mid to latenineteenth century they are 2 and 3 stories tall and faced with unpainted brick this section is characterized by large single buildings that take up entire city blocks and smaller individual buildings that are connected with neighboring buildings by party walls these urban buildings are built directly on their front lot lines and adjoin the public sidewalk with no setback or green space roofs are not visible from the street level the buildings feature commercial space on the ground floor and residential or office space on the upper floors the commercial storefronts are characterized by recessed entrances flanked by large plate glass display windows that are raised on low wood or marble bulkheads although these are covered over in many cases the majority of the buildings feature rectangular glass zoning law of the city of salamanca new york 83 transoms over the entrances and shopfront windows that were designed to allow for additional interior illumination the commercial first floor is visually delineated from the upper stories by projecting metal or wood lintels that span the width of the building facade upper stories are characterized by multiple symmetrically arranged tall doublehung sash wood windows that feature a single large pane in the upper sash over a single lower pane in the lower sash known as 1over1 windows decorative features on the north side of the allegheny river are generally derived from italianate victorian and romanesque revival styles of architecture long building facades are visually broken up by windows with decorative window hoods and sills in brick stone andor metal most buildings are crowned by decorative metal cornices  city center district  south side of the allegheny river the architecture on the south side of the b1  city center use district generally dates from the 1920s and 1930s as a result of a fire of 1923 that leveled the district south of the river the overall massing of buildings is generally more square and blocklike than is the case in the north side of the district typically buildings range between 1 and 2 stories in height and are made of brick they are urban buildings with no setbacks from front lot lines and no intermediate green space as in the north side of the district south side buildings are designed to have commercial spaces on their first floors and office and residential spaces on the second floor the commercial first floors feature recessed entrances flanked by large display windows that span the width of the buildings low bulkheads made of wood or marble raise the windows above the sidewalk rectangular transoms including some that retain their original leaded spectral glass are featured above the shop windows and entrances upper stories which house residences and office space have metal or wood sash 1over1 windows which are often grouped in pairs unlike the older buildings in the north side of the district these buildings feature little or no decoration they present a more modern streamlined appearance typical of early twentieth century commercial architecture facades have smooth unbroken surfaces with no visual delineation between the first and second floors minimal decorative features consist generally of brick corbelling or flat stone detailing around windows windows have plain brick sills and flat brick lintels buildings topped by plain or stepped brick parapet walls are most common the few metal cornices that are featured on buildings in the south side of the district are less ornamental than those in the north side
