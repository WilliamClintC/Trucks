two  administration four  traffic six  general offenses eight  business regulation and taxation ten  streets utilities and public services twelve  planning and zoning fourteen  building and housing sixteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66006 and precede 66007 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to

passed 12480 89003 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to spur the economic development or redevelopment of identified areas which are lagging deteriorating or depressed to a degree that they no longer contribute satisfactorily to the economy and well being of their neighborhoods or which already are or soon may constitute a material economic or social deficit to the surrounding community passed 12480 89004 tax abatement agenerally state legislation now permits municipal corporations to create community reinvestment areas within such areas property owners who are willing to improve their property by either remodeling or by new construction may receive partial tax setaside or abatement for a limited number of years such abatement applies only to that part of their total real property value which is the increase brought about by the improvement personal property taxes cannot be abated under the community reinvestment program btaxes continuing in force taxes which are in force on real property such as land and the buildings thereon and which exist before any improvement is made under such program remain in effect for that portion of the property for the life of any tax abatement program that may be established all personal property taxes levied on tools equipment machinery fixtures inventory etc before the start of an abatement program and such taxes on all new personal property added during the life of an abatement period will continue to be collected in the same manner as taxes collected from a like establishment which is not in a community reinvestment area cimprovements eligible for tax abatement the following are the upper time limits for tax abatement on real property improvements in a community reinvestment area which may be granted by council 1up to ten years for existing one and twofamily dwellings with remodeling of two thousand five hundred dollars $2500 or more  2up to twelve years for existing dwellings of more than two units and existing commercial and industrial structures with remodeling of five thousand dollars $5000 or more  and 3up to fifteen years for any newly constructed dwelling or commercial or industrial building the time limits enumerated in this subsection are the maximum number of years of tax abatement that may be granted or negotiated by the approving authority at the time each reinvestment area is established when the number of years of abatement is set for each of three improvement categories above they remain fixed and may be granted to owners making such improvements within the reinvestment area the approving authority however at the start of each program may also establish if it wishes a lesser time period during which applications may be filed to become eligible for the abatement such periods for application eligibility may later be extended or renewed by the approving authority subject to the conditions of the law at that time dprogram study as the result of the establishment of community reinvestment areas current tax yields are never lost reduced or abated only that portion of a potentially increased tax yield which by encouragement of such program would be brought about by major remodeling or new construction and only to the extent that it increases the value of the real property and only for a limited number of years may be so abated all previously existing taxes including all personal property taxes continue to flow in full as before passed 12480  passed 4600 89005 authority  resolution for establishment of areas the authority for this program is set forth in ohio rc 373565 any community reinvestment area established in the incorporated area of the municipality shall be established by resolution of council passed 12480 89006 criteria for establishment of areas criteria have been established to identify possible areas to be designated for community reinvestment and to evaluate the nature and the amount of the benefit to be gained by the municipality if tax abatement is made available under the community reinvestment program it is anticipated that this authority will be used carefully by council and will be restricted to those cases which will provide a substantial benefit for a long period of time as a consequence the deliberations leading to the creation of a community reinvestment area will be thorough since each candidate area and each applicant will have varying conditions unique to its particular circumstances the following criteria are selected as a check list and to structure the deliberations such criteria are not intended to be used as a weighted scoring mechanism it is conceivable that under certain circumstances a strongly adverse single condition may be a sufficient reason for not designating a certain area or for not offering tax abatement to a certain applicant on the other hand only two or three strongly favorable circumstances may weigh heavily enough to properly merit the establishment of an area or the offer of abatement to an applicant in the following lists of criteria groupings are solely to facilitate the collection and analysis of information by subject areas in an orderly fashion relative positions of individual items in the list do not connote either priority consideration or relative importance the review criteria for the establishment of community reinvestment areas are as follows apreconditions preconditions for the establishment of such areas are as follows 1the identification of a delineated area which requires stimulus for economic development  2the provision of tax

periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base additionally structures that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss in order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth these regulations are adopted cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public
