periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss o743 3  statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private

need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  dto minimize prolonged business interruptions  eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  gto ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and hto ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions o743 3  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for arestricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging

less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing items in bmc d1 11 have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases bvariances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the statewide inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in this section cvariances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result dvariances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief evariances shall only be issued upon 1a showing of good and sufficient cause  2a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in bmc d or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances fvariances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to the physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare gvariances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection a of this section and otherwise complies with bmc a hany applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
