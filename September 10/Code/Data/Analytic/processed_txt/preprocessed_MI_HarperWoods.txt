orderly movement of motorized vehicles nonmotorized vehicles and pedestrians  13 recognize that there are generally accepted and empirically derived standards for the type size spacing area and setback of signs based upon the speed limits and number of vehicular traffic lanes on the street which they front these standards are generally intended to allow signs that can be recognized at a given distance by a motorist allowing them to safely slow down turn into and access the site for which the sign advertises however these standards do not account for the peculiar characteristics of the citys business corridors these characteristics include but are not limited to the following unusually narrow widths and shallow depths of commercial properties fronting on the citys major thoroughfares caused by progressive road widening  the proximity of existing buildings to each other and to property and rightofway lines  traffic flows and congestion levels  and the goals and objectives of the citys comprehensive development plan and zoning code  14 prevent signs that are potentially dangerous to the public due to structural deficiencies disrepair or distraction to

improve the image of the city by encouraging signs which are compatible with conforming existing signs have good viewing qualities with passing motorists and are compatible with buildings and streets establishment of specific standards for various areas in the city the city has thus determined that these characteristics warrant modifications to these generally accepted though empirically derived sign standards the regulations and standards of this chapter represent these modifications and are considered the minimum amount of regulation necessary to achieve a substantial government interest

effective date of this chapter is prohibited  electronic display a findings studies show that there is a correlation between electronic displays on signs and the distraction of highway drivers distraction can lead to traffic accidents drivers can be distracted not only by a changing message but also by knowing that the sign has a changing message drivers may watch a sign waiting for the next change to occur drivers are also distracted by messages that do not tell the full story in one look people have a natural desire to see the end of the story and will continue to look at the sign in order to wait for the end in addition drivers are more distracted by special effects used to change the message such as fadeins and fadeouts finally drivers are generally more distracted by messages that are too small to be clearly viewed or that contain more than a simple message time and temperature displays appear to be an exception to these concerns because the messages are shorter and are easily absorbed and become inaccurate without frequent changes despite these public safety concerns there is merit to allowing new technologies to easily update messages except as prohibited by state or federal law sign owners should have the opportunity to use the technologies with certain restrictions the restrictions are intended to minimize potential driver distraction and proliferation in residential districts where signs can adversely impact the residential character b districts permitted electronic display technology shall be permitted for ground signs located in the
