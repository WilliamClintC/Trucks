and  confers upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health  sterling codifiers inc  288640 safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of elko does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations b finding of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of city of elko are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by structures that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effects of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to flood losses c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazards  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage  7 ensure potential buyers are notified of property located in areas of special flood hazards  8 ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards assume responsibility for their actions  and 9 maintain qualifying standards for participation in the national flood insurance program d methods of reducing flood losses to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  2 require that land uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains alluvial fans stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other

forestry outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only j alluvial fan advisory 1 alluvial fans present a unique flood hazard environment where the combination of sediment slope and topography create an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not provide reliable protection active alluvial fan flooding is characterized by flow path uncertainty combined with abrupt deposition and erosion as a result any area of an alluvial fan may be subject to intense flood hazards the technology of mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of water and debris flows for alluvial fans is still in the early development stage the federal emergency management agency fema has formulated a mapping procedure for the purpose of defining the likelihood of flood hazards on inundated alluvial fan zones to be used for flood insurance purposes and general floodplain regulation referred to as the fema alluvial fan methodology an active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three 3 related criteria a flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex  b abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or debris flow loses its competence to carry material eroded from a steeper upstream source area  and c an environment where the combination of sediment availability slope and topography creates an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not reliably mitigate the risk inactive alluvial fan flooding is similar to traditional riverine flood hazards but occurs only on alluvial fans it is characterized by flow paths with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in the reliable mitigation of the hazard counter to active alluvial fan flooding hazards an inactive alluvial fan flooding hazard is characterized by relatively stable flow paths however areas of inactive alluvial fan flooding as with active alluvial fan flooding may be subject to sediment deposition and erosion but to a degree that does not cause flow path instability and uncertainty an alluvial fan may exhibit both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive alluvial fan flooding hazards the hazards may vary spatially or vary at the same location contingent on the level of flow discharge spatially for example upstream inactive portions of the alluvial fan may distribute flood flow to active areas at the distal part of the alluvial fan hazards may vary at the same location for example with a flow path that may be stable for  sterling codifiers inc  307640

variance procedures a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principal of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate if upon review the administrator of fema determines that community practices indicate a pattern of issuing variances that is inconsistent with the objectives of sound floodplain management the community may be suspended from the national flood insurance program b appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and a the danger of materials being swept onto other lands and injuring others  b the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site   sterling codifiers inc  308640 k the cost of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the elko county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears as an exception on the title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvements and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of sections 384 administration and 385 provisions for flood hazard reduction of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in section 382 definitions of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposed but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause such as renovation rehabilitation or reconstruction variances issued for economic considerations aesthetics or because variances have been used in the past are not good and sufficient cause b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in section 3 82 definitions of this chapter to the applicant c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in section 382 of this chapter cause fraud or victimization as defined in section 382 of this chapter of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections c1 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance  sterling codifiers inc  309640 7 upon consideration of all the factors of subsection b appeal board of this section and the purposes of this chapter the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 8 the city council shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variance to the federal emergency management agency upon request 9 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest flood elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation  387 map revisionamendment procedures a letters of map revisionamendment national flood insurance program regulations provide procedures to remove property from the
