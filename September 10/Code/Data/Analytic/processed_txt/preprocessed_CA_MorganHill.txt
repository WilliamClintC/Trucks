versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title

10172018 mobile home park rents general provisions   purpose a mobile home owners unlike apartment tenants or residents of other rental stock are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment in a residence for which space is rented or leased removal andor relocation of a mobile home from a park space is not a practical alternative to accepting an excessive rent increase in that it can only be accomplished at substantial cost and in many instances may cause extensive damage to the mobile home and loss of appurtenances such as integrated landscaping and supporting structures inconsistent with the new location because mobile homes are often owned by senior citizens persons on fixed incomes and persons of low and moderate income exorbitant rent increases fall upon these individuals with particular harshness b the city has sponsored extensive negotiations to eliminate the need for the ordinance codified in this chapter only one of the citys mobile home parks achieved a mediated solution as a result of this delay the remaining parks were unable to reach agreement after extensive negotiation  thus necessitating the ordinance codified in this chapter c since approximately july 198 a heightened pattern of excessive rent increases has emerged within some of the mobile home parks in the city in disregard of the purposes and intent of the citys previous ordinances incorporation of these unduly excessive prior increases within the rate structure of this chapter without provisions for their review would materially defeat the purposes and intent of this chapter and the stability it seeks to bring about d the city council declares that it is necessary in the public interest to establish a means by which to resolve the potentially divisive and harmful impasse between park owners and coach owners after consideration of numerous factors among which are the relatively small number of parks located within the city the level of organization and communication between mobile home owners in each park and mandates of state law regulations which best fit the needs of the city have been selected e the regulations which are set forth in this chapter are designed to produce stability in rent increases for mobile home park tenants while recognizing the rights of mobile home park owners to receive a just and reasonable return on their property the standards utilizing the concept of net operating income and a 1981 base year adopted by of this chapter are intended to provide the necessary adjustment mechanism to meet constitutional requirements f the council finds that the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter will not have a significant substantial or adverse effect on the physical environment of the community because enactment of this chapter involves no deviation from the general plan and no change in the present use of any property within the city ns  1 part 1988   definitions for the purposes of this

1994 title 12  streets sidewalks and public places street and sidewalk development   city council findings as to need and purpose in enacting this chapter the city council of the city of morgan hill finds as follows since its settlement and until its incorporation morgan hill was an agricultural community its street pattern was designed originally for light traffic since its incorporation in 190 morgan hill has grown from a small town to a city of over twentyfive thousand persons land uses have changed from agricultural to residential commercial and industrial as a direct result previously existing streets and highways are inadequate in width and development to provide acceptable service capacities to the community inadequate streets deny minimum standards for safe convenient automobile and pedestrian travel within and without the city the problem is aggravated because city development has not been contiguous nor centralized but peripheral consequently more street development has been necessary to provide an adequate traffic circulation pattern in addition each development increases the traffic to and from that development so that development itself imposes everincreasing traffic burdens on local streets and highways and upon available community resources funds to provide for street and highway development in a relatively new community have always been limited and are now even more restricted revenues from taxes are limited by law for general law cities such as morgan hill recent changes in the law have further restricted street and highway development s ability to finance street and highway development measures available tax dollars must be shared with the other important community needs of police and fire protection health and safety parks and recreation and public administration while financing of street improvements is available district proceedings such proceedings are costly time consuming and complex and their availability may depend upon the consent of landowners or citizens which consent cannot always be obtained since a given development creates traffic which in turn creates the need for improved streets and highways and since a given development directly benefits from improved streets and highways by being more accessible the city council finds it is appropriate to require a contribution toward street improvement when a parcel of land develops to help offset the burden the development creates and to compensate the community at large for the benefit the development receives the city council finds that unless measures are taken

low humidity during summer months winter rains promote the growth of grass and brush this vegetation presents heavy dry fuel loads in the summer months these conditions are conducive to the ready ignition propagation and spread of grass brush and structure fires fog heavy rains mud slides and earthquakes are other common occurrences which negatively affect the ability of the citys public safety resources to respond to emergency situations the topography of morgan hill has hillside homes on each side of the city causing long response time for safety equipment the city is in a category

frequencies and velocities increase causing a greater threat to humans damage to property destruction of natural floodplain functions and adverse impacts to water quality c these flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or protected from flood damage the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss ns  2 9272017   statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and

result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d control filling grading

nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate a variances requiring city council approval requests for a variance shall be submitted in writing to the floodplain administrator by an applicant on an official city application form accompanied by all required documentation and a fee as established by resolution of the city council when a variance request has been filed the floodplain administrator shall prepare a report on the matter including all of the application materials submitted and schedule the matter for city council hearing within 90 days of receiving the variance request b administrative variances the floodplain administrator shall approve or deny an application requesting an administrative variance after receipt of a complete application administrative variances may only be granted to existing structures with substantial improvements to allow the

may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of         and  of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances do not need to be issued for any accessory structures as defined in  within a special flood hazard area all accessory structures shall meet the standards in c5 c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means that the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance e any applicant to whom a variance is granted by the city council shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the santa clara county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land the applicant will be required to indemnify and hold harmless the city for any incident which may result from the issuance of the variance f the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency ns  2 9272017   appeal board the city council shall act as the appeal board and shall hear and decide the appeals and nonadministrative requests for variances

grounds of the appeal or variance  provided however that the city council may by motion duly passed elect in its discretion to grant a hearing de novo the applicant shall have the burden of establishing cause why the action appealed from should be altered reversed or modified or why the variance should be granted the decision of the city council on the appeal or variance request shall be final and shall be effective on the date the decision is rendered a in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services

the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges b variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances c variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvements and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the
