hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages  statement of purpose and objectives it is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters and control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion additionally the ordinance from which this chapter is derived prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area the provisions of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be

radioactive wastes and other radioactive materials into within out of the town 4 the capability of emergency preparedness and response by the town to radioactive materials release by accident or

general to all development quick introduction i4 the port royal page intentionally left blank introduction i30 the port royal i10 background the port royal a regulatory framework for preserving and enhancing existing communities within the town of port royal while promoting places of character that are both time honored and meaningful common to these places is the notion of walkable urbanism  that places of human habitat should be of a scale that is primarily pedestrianoriented in nature allowing residences businesses and civic spaces to locate within walking distance of one another this approach simultaneously preserves the best aspects of urban living as well as critical open spaces and natural resources the port royal implements the 2009 comprehensive plan specifically the goal to establish a townwide formbased urban form goal update port royals zoning regulations to a formbased order to properly consider the importance of community design and character building placement and proportions and the impact of private development on the public realm i 20 formbased codes the traditional town overlay utilized building types as its primary organizing principle while implementing the same concepts the port royal the rural to urban transect as its primary organizing principle a far more extensive framework that delineates building types but also addresses civic spaces thoroughfares and other key components that impact and shape our public realm i 30 the rural to urban transect the port royal the rural to urban transect as its primary organizing principle for purposes of this ordinance a transect is a cut or crosssection of the environment that expresses the range and variety of habitats located throughout the town these habitats are used to establish zoning districts known as transect zones or tzones along a continuum of intensity that ranges from the most natural environment to the most urban environment six primary transect zones are identified in a prototypical american ruraltourban transect rarely does a region contain all six transect zones this is the case with port royal which lacks the vertically intense t6 zone that often anchors a large city with highrise buildings as well as the rural t2 zone found just outside the towns boundaries in beaufort county see diagram i30a port royal ruraltourban transect transect zones vary by the ratio and level of intensity of their natural built and social the port royal a formbased fbc a formbased physical form character and intensity rather than the separation of uses to ensure predictable built results and a highquality public realm the port royal upon the foundation established by the traditional town master plan 1995 and subsequent overlay district 1997 while primarily limited to the traditional grid the latter was one of the first municipal formbased codes in the united states see diagram i20a master plan for infill development the port royal to update this landmark document while expanding the formbased approach to zoning throughout the entire town diagram i20a master plan for infill development i30 introduction i6 the port royal this ensures that urban areas will look and feel urban while suburban areas will look and feel suburban nearly every aspect of the environment can be organized using the rural to urban principle including streets civic spaces buildings uses signs fences etc even within a transect zone there frequently exists a range in these components this allows for significant diversity within a relatively similar environment for example the port royal three levels of t3 edge suburban neighborhood and neighborhood each of these districts is similar in character primarily residential but slightly more intense and diverse than its predecessor the ruraltourban transect has its foundation in nature and is applicable to the lowcountry as has been illustrated in james wassells crosssection depicting the canaveral national seashore see diagram i30b transect or crosssection of an island diagram i30a port royal ruraltourban transect diagram i30b transect or crosssection of an island t1 t3 t5 t4 not applicable t2 t6 introduction i50 the port royal i40 pedestrian sheds transectbased zoning is most effective when applied at the community  neighborhood scale using predetermined pedestrian sheds the pedestrian shed is the fundamental building block of walkable urbanism and is used to represent the distance that most people are willing to walk to a common destination such as a downtown attraction main street shop or neighborhood park generally this distance ranges from  to  mile and requires a 5 to 10 minute walk while often depicted as perfect circles in reality pedestrian sheds have irregular shapes as they cover the actual distance walked not the linear distance planners and designers use pedestrian sheds to determine the center middle and edge of various communities and apply appropriate transect zones to the zoning map see diagrams i40 ac below by assigning multiple transect zones to each pedestrian shed the resident s of a community are exposed to a diverse environment that is highly walkable for example a resident of a singlefamily home in t3 is able to enjoy a morning jog along the t1 marshfront having worked up an appetite they can walk to their favorite main street restaurant for breakfast t5 on the way home they can stop off at the neighborhood corner store t4 to pick up some milk and bread in some form or fashion these or similar opportunities should be available and located within every residents pedestrian shed transectbased zoning allows for this i50 conclusion the pedestrian shed the rural to urban transect and formbased standards are the central building blocks for ensuring that walkable places  places of unique character that are time honored and meaningful  will continue to exist and be built anew in port royal diagram i40a standard pedestrian shed configured to a common destination diagram i40c sample zoning map with transect zones configured to a pedestrian shed diagram i40b elongated or linear pedestrian shed configured to a main street i60 introduction i8 the port

an interconnected street network increases the number of routes available for users resulting in less traffic greater safety and increased cost savings local drivers can choose from multiple routes allowing vehicles to disperse throughout the system and keeping traffic light if there is an accident one simply chooses a different path a complete network also ensures greater access and quicker response times for emergency and service vehicles this results in fewer miles traveled and less consumption of fuel more importantly it has the potential to save lives finally the presence of an interconnected network reduces the need for costly road widening projects and new turning lanes administrative adjustment  general to all development 26 the port royal circulation a pedestrian

because rear alleys and lanes alleys and lanes have both a functional and aesthetic basis an alleyway is where all of the messy stuff should go this includes driveways garage doors trash containers recycling bins and utility boxes and meters when utilities are located on an alleyway the street can be significantly narrower resulting in less pavement more trees and wider sidewalks freeing the street of such clutter allows a buildings front faade to be sited closer to the street and places greater emphasis on human habitation eg porches and stoops over garages and driveways finally alleyways provide occupants of accessory dwelling units with vehicular access to their unit but more importantly they afford fire trucks with an alternative path to the main building or buildings on

serves as a focal point and interrupts or blocks the view as one looks down a street or corridor such features improve spatial definition and orientation by creating memorable places that stimulate the senses and make our communities more interesting historically the numbered streets in port royal terminated with a view of the river or marsh this reinforces our communitys surroundings and fondness for the water when a street vista terminates on a building it should be architecturally pleasing if not significant 13th street terminates on historic port royal elementary school this prominent vista reinforces our communitys belief in education our youth and the future we do this because reverse frontage reverse frontage lots are often used in suburban settings when new residential neighborhoods are created along major thoroughfares houses on these lots turn their back on the main road and are separated by a planted buffer or berm because the houses do not front the thoroughfare either directly or via a frontage road this design is inefficient dangerous and scaled entirely to the automobile a traditional street network promotes single frontage lots in which all thoroughfares are fronted by buildings the buildings frontage establishes a strong vertical edge this has the effect of slowing traffic creating interesting places to walk to and increasing the number

thoroughfare type in transect zones include the following 1 parking parking availability onsite or on the thoroughfare will influence the appropriate thoroughfare type parking will also be determined by lot size and use 2 truck access thoroughfares that provide access to high volumes of large trucks may need additional design considerations to mitigate potential negative effects on walkability 3

intersections at the developers expense  movement types and design speed movement types are intended to assist in the selection of the appropriate thoroughfare design for the necessary level of pedestrian and bicyclist safety and comfort at any given location design speed is the primary determinant of movement type a list of approved movement types along with their assigned lane widths and curb radii is provided for each transect zone in tables ad following is a list of movement types a yield drivers must proceed slowly with extreme care and must yield to approaching traffic when vehicles are parked on both sides of the thoroughfare creating essentially one a yield thoroughfare is the functional equivalent of traffic calming in addition to yield movement use on normal thoroughfares this movement is used for alleys and rear lanes for these applications the primary purpose is access to rear loaded drivewaysaccess for residential and commercial property design speed is less than 20 mph b slow drivers can proceed carefully with an occasional stop to allow a pedestrian to cross or another car to park the character of the thoroughfare should make drivers uncomfortable exceeding the design speed due to the presence of parked cars sense of enclosure from buildings and street trees tight turning radii and other design elements design speed is 2025 mph c low drivers can generally expect to travel without delay at the appropriate design speed thoroughfare design supports safe pedestrian movement at the higher design speed this movement type is appropriate for thoroughfares designed to traverse longer distances or connect to higher intensity locations design speed is 3035 mph d suburban this is a conventional thoroughfare design in which drivers can expect a separation of modes ie bike lanes walking paths and roads allowing automobiles to travel unimpeded by pedestrians or walkability concerns this movement type is rarely used in the t3 thoroughfare standards 216 the port royal zones but may be needed when a thoroughfare crosses t1 transect zone design speed may be above 35 mph the design criteria for yield slow and low thoroughfares shall be commensurate with local thoroughfares design speeds higher than 35 mph shall not be used in areas intended to support moderate or high levels of pedestrian or bicycle activity due to concerns with safety and comfort  intersections a turning movements 1 street design of narrow streets and compact intersections requires designers to pay close attention to the operational needs of transit fire and rescue waste collection and delivery trucks for this reason early coordination with transit fire and rescue waste collection and other stakeholder groups is essential 2 more regular encroachment of turning vehicles into opposing lanes will occur at compact intersections therefore frequency of access traffic volumes and the speeds on intersecting streets at those intersections must be considered when designing intersections for fire and rescue determination of the importance of that street for community access should be determined eg primary or secondary access 3 when present bike lanes and onstreet parking will increase the effective curb return radius when curb extensions are not employed by providing more room for the wheel tracking of turning vehicles the designer should use turning templates or software to evaluate intersections to ensure adequate operation of vehicles can occur location of onstreet parking around intersections should be evaluated during this analysis to identify potential conflicts between turning vehicles and onstreet parking b visual obstructions no fence wall tree terrace building sign shrubbery hedge or other planting or structure or object capable of obstructing driver vision shall be allowed at intersections c street jogs street intersection jogs or centerline offsets of less than 150 feet are prohibited

as shown in any locally adopted land use or transportation plan or approved town or county transportation plan or approved transportation policy 4 signal spacing concerns may be ameliorated in the following ways a a proposed private road that may otherwise be considered for the installation of a traffic signal may be replaced by an onsite route or a frontage road that directs traffic to or from a nearby public road  b a private road that is being considered for traffic signal installation may be required to connect to the existing or planned local road system to allow uses of surrounding properties  c an existing or proposed intersection may be relocated  or d a shared private road may be required to serve the needs of the multiple properties 5 a traffic signal progression analysis

stories regulating height by stories rather than feet allows developers to use taller floortoceiling heights which leads to more efficient aesthetically pleasing and historically accurate buildings this approach discourages developers from using minimal floor heights or flatter roofs in order to force as many floors into a building as possible instead the number of stories is limited and the height of each story is confined to a range designers are provided the flexibility necessary to create wellproportioned buildings that are tall enough to define the streetscape the port royal division

greece and were originally designed for light control ventilation and protection from the elements in a tropical environment one of the very basic premises that all shutters should have is that they look like they could actually protect your windows that means that if they could be closed they would cover the window too many houses are designed with windows that were never intended to have shutters aesthetically pleasing operable exterior shutters provide shade keeping the hot sun out and allowing cool breezes to ventilate the building operable shutters also provide an additional level

provide outdoor living space that is shaded from the sun and protected from the elements  yet still permits breezes to infiltrate the body of the building this helps to save energy and reduce costs aesthetically they provide architectural interest and delineate the buildings entrance the porch also helps to transition the private and public realm encouraging both neighborly and community interaction we do this because traditional materials elements such as wood brick stone concrete stucco and tabby are derived from the earth and provide a sense of connection with our environment as they are more likely to me mined or farmed locally buildings comprised of these materials can last for centuries conveying a sense of authenticity strength and longevity furthermore they can be patched painted and repaired rather easily while synthetic and highly processed materials such as vinyl pvc or aluminum may be less expensive initially or require less maintenance they are not built

to ensure that walkable urban patterns of development are favored as the primary best management practices bmps  and b minimize increases in stormwater runoff from new development or redevelopment to the maximum extent practical for the applicable design storm in order to reduce flooding siltation erosion increases in temperature and to maintain the integrity of stream channels marshes and aquatic habitats  and c minimize increases in nonpoint and point source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development that would otherwise degrade local water quality  and d minimize the total volume of surface water runoff that flows from any specific site during and following development in order to replicate pre development hydrology to the maximum extent practicable use of structural and

stormwater bmp type allowed in vegetated swales are shallow drainage ways that employ landscaping to provide water quality treatment via biofiltration they are designed to remove silt and sediment associated pollutants before discharging to storm sewers and to reduce volume if soils allow for infiltration the treatment area can be planted in a variety of grasses sedges and rushes while the side slopes can be planted with shrubs and groundcover check dams are added to aid infiltration green roofs are a way of managing stormwater in urban areas with limited space for more land intensive bmps green roofs are able to store stormwater in the soil medium during rain events helping to detain runoff some of the stormwater will be taken up by the roots of the plants and some will be evaporated from the soil medium reducing the amount of runoff from the roof pervious paving systems allow water to pass freely interstitial space ingrained throughout the paving matrix thereby transforming traditionally impervious surfaces several examples are pervious concrete and asphalt interlocking pavers and reinforced gravel and grass paving rain gardens are flatbottomed landscaped depressions that can be built to any size or shape also known as bioretention cells they are designed to allow water to settle and infiltrate into the soil they reduce the peak discharge rate from a site via detention water quality improvements are achieved settling nutrient uptake and filtration as water soaks into the ground disconnected downspouts in lower density residential areas downspouts should be disconnected from storm drain systems and directed towards landscaped areas this reduces the burden on the storm drain network and allows runoff to slow and infiltrate before overflowing to storm drains tree box filters are containers filled with a soil mixture a mulch layer underdrain system and a shrub or tree similar to flow the compact size of tree box filters allow volume and water quality control to be tailored to specific site characteristics and are well suited to urban areas tree box filters provide the added value of aesthetics while making efficient use of available land

detained by smaller decentralized means while larger storm events should be directed to nonpriority vegetated landscapes for temporary detention urban flood plain urban hardscapes can be used for temporary storage of large storm events smaller events should be mitigated by decentralized means while the larger events can be directed toward nonpriority spaces which are planned and designed for the temporary storage of stormwater flows riffle pools connected landscapes provide retention of runoff by integrating intermittent vertical drops and damming in a watercourse the retained runoff is then allowed to infiltrate into the groundwater table or conveyed for further treatment floware landscape features that also provide stormwater runoff control and treatment flowthrough planters are sealed on all sides and fitted with an underdrain they only absorb as much water as soil and plants in the planter can accommodate once the planter is at capacity water is then discharged underdrain they are ideal for receiving roof runoff from downspouts and can be incorporated into foundation walls infiltration trenches are subsurface facilities designed to provide onsite stormwater retention in areas of good infiltration by collecting and recharging stormwater runoff into the ground trenches filter pollutants to improve water quality and contribute towards groundwater recharge they are relatively low maintenance and can be easily retrofitted into existing sidewalk areas and medians a natural channel is a meandering vegetated watercourse with natural banks it is buffered from

the port royal table a stormwater bmps by transect zone continued stormwater bmp type allowed in dry detention ponds are basis whose outlets have been designed to retain stormwater runoff for some minimum time eg 24 hours to allow particles and associated pollutants to settle unlike wet ponds these facilities do not have a large permanent pool of water however they are often designed with small pools at the inlet and outlet of the basin ponds require land to be set aside in a manner that can disrupt the quality of the surrounding urbanism they should be utilized with caution in the t4 zoning districts wet retention ponds consist of a permanent pool of water into which stormwater runoff from each rain event is detained and treated in the pond until it is displaced by runoff from the next storm wet ponds allow for additional biological interactions that assist in improving water quality for nutrients ponds require land to be set aside in a manner that can disrupt the quality of the surrounding urbanism and should be utilized with caution in the t4 zoning districts urban channels are narrow vegetated or stone lined conveyances framed by vertical stone or concrete banks abutting cultivated landscapes or hardscapes level spreaders are structures that are designed to uniformly distribute concentrated flow over a large area to mimic natural sheet flow concentrated flow enters the spreader pipe ditch or swale  the flow is retarded energy is dissipated  the flow is distributed throughout a long linear shallow trench or behind a low berm  water then flows over the bermditch uniformly in theory along the entire length rain barrels are connected directly to downspouts to capture and store runoff for future use stormwater discharge is slowed down and water can be reused for irrigation fifty gallons of storage is suggested as a minimum barrels must also have a cover to prevent insect and debris collection cisterns function similar to rain barrels by collected stormwater and storing it for reuse but on a much larger scale cisterns can be stored above ground buried below ground or located inside of buildings they typically store rainwater for reuse in irrigation
