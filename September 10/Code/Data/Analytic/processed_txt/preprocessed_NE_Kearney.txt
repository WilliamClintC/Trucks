uses are permitted with different conditions these are displayed in table 141 the use matrix levels of permission include a uses which are permitted by right these uses are permitted subject to issuance of a building permit by the building official subject only to compliance with all regulations of this permitted by right might be subject to supplemental regulations contained in this uses are indicated in the use matrix by a p in the applicable cell b conditional uses these uses are subject to approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission and city council following the procedure set forth in these uses are indicated in the use matrix by a c in the applicable cell c planned development these uses are subject to a planned development overlay district which may require additional conditions above the site development regulations for the district subject to approval by planning commission and city council following the procedure set forth in these uses are indicated by a pd in the applicable cell   effective  14113  guide to site development regulators the regulators set forth in the tables in chapters 15 establish the limits and requirements for most development in the city of kearney and its extraterritorial jurisdiction this section is intended to provide guidance for applying the regulators contained in these tables a site area per housing unit this indicates the gross land area per unit within a residential development for example a forty 40 lot subdivision on a ten 10 acre four hundred thirtyfive thousand six hundred 435600 square foot tract will have a site area per unit of ten thousand eight hundred ninety 10890 square feet site area per unit which measures gross density may differ from minimum lot size in conservation development the site area per unit will be larger than minimum lot size permitting the clustering of lots in exchange for common open space in multifamily development the site area per unit will usually be smaller than minimum lot size because the lot is the legal parcel on which a multipleunit building is built b minimum lot area this indicates the minimum size of a legally described and recorded parcel upon which development can take place as noted above minimum lot area and site area per unit may not be the same c minimum lot width this is the required minimum distance connecting at points along opposite side lot lines measured at the required front yard setback for example the lot width of an irregular lot in a district requiring a twentyfive 25foot front yard setback is determined by 1 locating the points along each side lot line at a distance of twentyfive 25 feet back from the front property line 2 drawing a line connecting these two 2 points 3 measuring the length of this line the length is the lot width d minimum yards these define the required setbacks of buildings from front side and rear property lines while the yard requirements apply to a majority of development the for a number of exceptions some of these include 1 planned developments front yard setbacks can be varied within planned developments which are reviewed and approved by the city council after a recommendation from the planning commission 2 major streets the director of public works may require greater than normal setbacks along segments of the citys major street system as defined in the comprehensive development plan a map displaying these components and noting setback exceptions is included in the transportation the comprehensive development plan 3 flexibility provided by supplemental development regulations establishes supplemental regulations many of which provide flexibility or variations in setback regulations for specific contexts 4 maximum setbacks some specific zoning districts provide maximum as well as minimum setbacks these setbacks establish buildto lines which may be necessary to protect the appearance and character of special urban districts e maximum height height normally measures the vertical distance from the established grade to the highest point of a building however as established by the definition of height the point of measurement may vary for different types of buildings and roof slopes height measurement for small and large wind energy conversion systems shall include the height of the tower plus any part of the rotor or turbine that projects above the top of the tower to its highest point f maximum building coverage this measures the percentage of a site that may be covered by the footprint of buildings thus a twenty thousand 20000 square foot building on a forty thousand 40000 square foot site has a building coverage of fifty percent 50% this is a method of regulating the scale of buildings in an area g maximum impervious coverage this measures the percentage of a site that may be covered by buildings and other surfaces and development features which prevent the penetration of water into the ground such as driveways porches parking lots and other features limits on impervious coverage help control the velocity and quantity of storm water runoff and provide for groundwater recharge h floor area ratio just as site area per unit controls the density of residential development floor area ration far controls the density of nonresidential development far is the ratio of gross floor area of a building to total site area thus in an area with a maximum permitted far of 10 a forty thousand 40000 square foot building may be located on a forty thousand 40000 square foot site naturally because of coverage ratios landscaping and parking requirements such a building will be multistory i maximum amount of total parking in street yard this controls the maximum amount of parking that can be located in the area between a building facade and the street when applied in certain zoning districts it is intended to reduce the number of cars seen from the street encourage site planning which locates parking in rear and side yards and produce a stronger relationship between buildings and streets for example a project with one hundred 100 parking stalls and a fifty percent 50% limit on the amount of parking located in street yards must locate fifty 50 of its stalls in rear or side yards without street exposure j project size requiring planned development district some projects are so large in relative scale or impact that they require specific project review planned development district process set forth in this regulator establishes the threshold size for projects which must go specific project approval process for example in some districts a project that includes a site of four 4 acres and over or a planned building area in excess of forty thousand 40000 square feet must be developed as a planned district k minimum depth of landscaping adjacent to street rightsofway this establishes the depth of landscaping that must be provided on private property adjacent and in from the rightofway line thus if the required minimum depth is fifteen 15 feet a project must landscape the first fifteen 15 feet of its site back from the rightofway line all landscaping must be done in accordance with establishing landscaping standards l minimum bufferyard requirements this establishes the depth of a bufferyard that must be provided by intensive land uses adjacent to primarily residential land uses in residential zoning districts all landscaping must be done in accordance with establishing landscaping standards m supplemental use regulations certain permitted uses require satisfaction of specific requirements in order to function successfully in their urban or rural contexts these supplemental requirements are set forth in these requirements are crossreferenced in the supplementary

comprise at least 35 percent 35% of the net developable area and shall be designated and permanently protected full density credit shall be allowed for land in this category that would otherwise be buildable under local state and federal regulations so that their development potential is not reduced by this designation such density credit may be applied to other unconstrained parts of the site secondary conservation areas are determined by specific project design and typically include all or some of the following kinds of resources a a one hundred 100 foot deep greenway buffer along all water bodies and watercourses and a fifty 50 foot greenway buffer alongside wetlands soils classified as very poorly drained in the medium intensity county soil survey of the usda natural resources

and general welfare and to minimize losses to property by applying the provisions of this chapter to a restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities b require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction c protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for intended purposes because of flood hazard d assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program when identified by the federal insurance administration as a flood prone community 43102  floodplain and floodway overlay districts findings of fact a flood losses resulting from periodic inundation flood hazard areas of the city of kearney nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life or property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 1 general causes of these flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodways causing increases in flood heights and velocities b the occupancy of flood areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood damages 2 methods used to analyze flood hazards this chapter uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent 1% chance of occurrence in any one 1 year as delineated by applicable flood insurance studies and the federal emergency management administrations flood insurance rate maps and flood boundary and floodway map effective on  or any subsequent effective flood insurance studies rate maps and flood boundary and floodway maps issued after the effective date of this ordinance and adopted by the city of kearney b calculation of water surface profiles based upon a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood c computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood b land to which this chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of kearney identified on the flood insurance rate map firm effective on  as numbered and unnumbered a zone andor within the overlay districts fp and fw established in this chapter in all areas covered by this chapter no development shall be permitted except upon a permit to develop granted by the city council or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city council may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the general welfare and health of the inhabitants of the community as contained in the city enforcement officer the chief building official of the city of kearney is hereby designated as the city councils duly designated enforcement officer under this chapter unless otherwise provided by the city council the central platte or tribasin natural resources district shall assist the city of kearney on interpretation of floodplainfloodway rules and regulations the enforcement officer shall obtain comments from the nrd as part of hisher review of all proposed activity in this overlay district d rules for interpretation of district boundaries the boundaries of the floodwayfloodway overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions the enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation in such cases where the interpretation is contested the board of adjustment will resolve the dispute the base flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present hisher case to the board of adjustment and to submit hisher own technical evidence if heshe so desires e compliance no development located within known flood hazard areas of the community shall be located extended converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations f abrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this chapter to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter imposes greater restrictions the provision of this chapter shall prevail all other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only g interpretation in their interpretation and application the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the city of kearney and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute h warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this chapter does not imply that areas outside floodway and floodway fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of kearney or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder i
