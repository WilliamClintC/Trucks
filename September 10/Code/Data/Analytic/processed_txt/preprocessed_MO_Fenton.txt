nonfunctioning sinkholes and sinkholes under a proposed building may be capped d sinkholes may be left in their natural state however they will still require properly sized outfall pipe to an adequate natural discharge point e all sinkholes must be inspected by the city of fenton missouri prior to treatment special siltation measures shall be installed during the excavation of sinkholes and during the grading operations to prevent siltation of the sinkhole crevice in general the following procedure shall be followed in treating sinkholes 1 excavation prior to filling operations in the vicinity of a sinkhole the earth in the bottom of the depression will be excavated to expose the fissures in the bedrock the length of fissure exposed will vary but must include all unfilled voids of fissure widths greater than onehalf  inch maximum dimensions which are not filled with plastic clay 2 closing fissures the fissure or void will be exposed until bedrock in its natural attitude is encountered the rock will be cleaned of loose material and the fissures will be handpacked with quarryrun rock of sufficient size to prevent entry to this rock into the fissures and all the voids between this rock filled with smaller rock so as to prevent the overlying materials entry into the fissures for a large opening a structural concrete dome will be constructed with vents to permit the flow of ground water 3 placing filter material of various gradations as approved will be placed on top of the handpacked rock with careful attention paid to the minimum thickness the filter must permit either upward or downward flow without loss of the overlying material 4 supervision periodic supervision of the cleaning of the rock fissures must be furnished by the soils engineer closing of the rock fissures will not begin until the cleaning has been inspected and approved by the soils engineer f during the placement and compaction of earth fill over the filter supervision by the soils engineer shall be continuous earth fill densities will be determined during the placement city code compaction of the fill in sufficient number to insure compliance with the specification the soils engineer is responsible for the quality of the work and to verify that the specifications are met 6 for reports concerning proposed development in units iia iiia iva or xa the consultant should prepare conditions within the report covering the following at a minimum a erosion of siltrich loessial soil what should be done to minimize surface erosion during and after construction also what measures should be taken to address erosive velocities at discharge points b developments on slopes greater than 20% soil creep is a potential problem on slopes this steep and developments in these areas will require engineering analysis and solutions 7 cut and fill construction of cut and fill slopes in these areas should be detailed to assure slope stability a for reports done on proposed developments in unit iv the consultant should prepare a report covering the following at a minimum 1 natural slope stability are the natural slopes on shale stable enough for the density of development proposed 2 swelling

stream erosion on private property foundation design foundation drainage road design excavation etc 9 the reports for the erosionprone area do not necessarily require subsurface investigation the shale areas however would almost certainly require shallow exploration the reports shall be prepared under the supervision of and sealed by an engineer 10 developments that require more detailed soils information are those with very dense housing greater than three to four 3  4 houses per acre extensive grading and site preparation including cut and fill steep slopes etc some developments can be

purpose the provisions of this govern the erection of all signs and flags together with their appurtenant and auxiliary devices in respect to size color location and structural and fire safety the city has promoted and preserved its character by systematically adopting and updating its zoning regulations as a result the purpose of this to allow a property owner the ability to make use of its property for free expression without any 67editors note former sign regulations containing which derived from  12232008   1282010    2 7232015   9222016 was repealed 11212016 by  1 of ordinance content based limitations but in a manner designed to avoid the visual clutter that is harmful to traffic and pedestrian safety property values business opportunities and community appearances 2 findings the board hereby finds that a sign regulations may impact first amendment rights and that these rights are important constitutional rights that must be protected b unregulated signage has direct and secondary effects that are harmful to the safety and general welfare of the city as a whole and to its individual citizens c these direct and secondary effects result from the visual clutter that occurs as a result of the unregulated installation and lack of maintenance of signs d these direct and secondary effects include harm to traffic and pedestrians safety depreciation of property values within the city decreased business opportunities for individual and business residents of the city resulting in decreased sales property and other tax revenues that are necessary to provide an adequate level of public service to city residents community blight and an overall less pleasing community appearance e residents are virtually captive audiences of signs displayed by neighbors  signs are an intrusion into residential privacy and interfere with the enjoyment of a residents property because the view from the residents property may become so marred by the clutter of signs that the resident cannot successfully avoid observing the sign clutter f because of these direct and secondary effects the city has a compelling interest in regulating signs within the city g these regulations are contentneutral and place restrictions that directly advance the citys stated interests h to the extent that any provisions of these regulations are contentbased they are intended to further compelling governmental interests i a primary and compelling interest of the city is to allow property owners to post public interest signs to protect the safety of others and to allow all persons to comply with legal requirements imposed by law or by order of a court requiring the posting of notices without being subject to regulation j the scope of these regulations is proportionate to the interests served and narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective city code  11212016 k a direct nexus exists between the desired citys goals and the means chosen in these regulations to

ordains as follows b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of the city of fenton missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by a the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and b the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this 75editors note of also adopted the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative map materials for st louis county dated 242015 as
