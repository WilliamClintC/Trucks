wisconsin construction site best management practice handbook  maintenance of control measures all sedimentation basins and other control measures necessary to meet the requirements of this article shall be maintained by the applicant or subsequent landowner during the period of land disturbance and land development of the site in a satisfactory manner to ensure adequate performance and to prevent nuisance conditions  control or erosion and pollutants during land disturbance and development a applicability this section applies to the following sites of land development or land disturbing activities 1 those requiring a subdivision plat approval or the construction of houses or commercial industrial or institutional buildings on lots of approved certified surveys 2 those requiring a certified survey approval or the construction of houses of commercial industrial or institutional buildings on lots of approved certified surveys 3 those involving grading removal of protective ground cover or vegetation excavation land filling or other land disturbing activity affecting a surface area of 4000 square feet or more 4 those involving excavation or filling or a

relocation or reconstruction 6 those involving the laying repairing replacing or enlarging of an underground pipe or facility for a distance of 300 feet or more the above applicability criteria are specifically stated in 1983 wisconsin act 416 for inclusion in this article utility companies responsible for energy repair work should enter into a memorandum of agreement with the department of inspection clearly stating their responsibilities if their activities may be included under any of the above applicability criteria b erosion and other pollutant control requirements the following requirements shall be met on all sites described in subsection a of this section 1 site dewatering a water pumped from the site shall be treated by temporary sedimentation basins grit chambers sand filters upslope chambers hydrocyclones swirl concentrators or other appropriate controls designed and used to remove particles of 100 microns or greater for the highest dewatering pumping rate if the water is demonstrated to have no particles greater than 100 microns during dewatering operations then no control is needed before discharge except as determined by the city water may not be discharged in a manner that causes erosion of the site or receiving channels b there are several ways to meet the particle size performance objective of subsection b1a of this section depending on the pumping rate as an example if the pumping rate is very low one gallonminute then an inclined or vertical enlargement pipe about eight inches in diameter for one gallonminute several feet along would be an adequate control device to restrict the discharge of 100 micron and larger particles as the pumping rate increases then the device must be enlarged at a moderate 100 gallonsminute pumping rate a vertical section of corrugated steel pipe or concrete pipe section or other small tank about 412 feet across for a 100 gallonsminute pumping rate several feet tall would be adequate with these pipe sections or small tanks inlet baffles would be needed to minimize turbulence with very large pumping rates 10000 gallonsminute sediment basins about 35 feet in diameter for a pumping rate of 10000 gallonsminute at least three feet in depth with a simple but adequately sized pipe outlet would be needed more sophisticated control devices such as swirl concentrators or hydrocyclones could be specially fabricated that would generally be smaller than the simple sedimentation devices described above but they would not be required c the performance standard of 100 micron maximum particles in the dewatering water at the maximum pumping rate significantly reduces the liability of the contractor when compared to a standard of no visible particulate matter if a properly sized device is correctly used based on the 100 micron particle size performance standard then discharges of visible particular matter would not constitute a violation it is not possible to design a control device that would ensure no visible particular matter discharges this 100 micron standard is intended to significantly reduce sedimentation problems in downstream drainage systems and in the receiving waters that are caused by large particles visible particulate matter will probably still occur in water meeting this standard as most turbidity effects are caused by very small particles that usually do not cause as severe a sedimentation problem as larger particles this 100 micron particle size performance standard was therefore selected to be easily met and enforced and to reduce sedimentation problems a no visible particulate matter standard in contrast could not be met easily or cheaply violations would frequently occur and inspectors would have to make frequent site visits and require frequent control device changes in addition particle size measurements would not be required to prove compliance with the 100 micron performance standard only the proper use of a device designed to meet this particle size criteria is needed however if a contractor or site engineer feels that the dewatering water does not contain any particles larger than 100 microns no control device would be needed if optional frequent particle size analyses confirm that fact in most cases the use of the simple control devices described previously would be less expensive and less bothersome than performing frequent particle size analyses 2 waste and material disposal all waste and unused building materials including garbage debris cleaning wastes wastewater toxic materials or hazardous materials shall be properly disposed and not allowed to be carried by runoff into a receiving channel or storm sewer system 3 tracking each site shall have graveled roads access drives and parking areas of sufficient

to the satisfaction of the plan commission that the facts and circumstances of the application establish an unnecessary hardship exists due to unique physical characteristics of the property and that the granting of the variance will neither harm the public interest nor undermine the purposes of the city codes in order to prove unnecessary hardship the following three standards must be proven a compliance with the strict letter of the applicable restriction would unreasonably prevent the owner from using the property for a permitted purpose or would render conformity with such restrictions unnecessarily burdensome under this standard the plan commission must judge what is a feasible use for the property as a whole and a variance is not warranted if the physical character of the property will allow the owner to build or develop the property in compliance with the applicable codes  b the hardship or difficulty must relate to the unique physical characteristics of the property and the hardship or difficulty must be peculiar to the property in question and different from that of other parcels and not one which affects all parcels similarly nor must the hardship be selfimposed nor must the hardship or difficulty be due solely to the desires of or conditions personal to the applicant such as the desire to increase the value or income potential of the property  and c the granting of a variance must neither harm the public nor undermine the purposes of the city codes the plan commission shall protect the interests of the public at large and shall preserve the enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district and the same vicinity a lack of local opposition shall not in itself mean that a variance will not harm the public interest after conducting the public hearing the plan commission shall make a written report and recommendation to the common council after receiving the plan commissions report and recommendation the common council may grant such variances to the extent and upon such terms as deemed just and proper such that the spirit of the codes is observed public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done unless otherwise expressly directed by the common council no public hearing shall be held before the common council to consider the granting or denial of a variance under this chapter 2

disease  standards for rain gardens and bioswales 1 definitions a rain gardens and bioswales can serve both as landscaping and stormwater management features on a building site where appropriately designed and sited a rain garden is a shallow depressed garden that is designed and positioned on a site to capture stormwater runoff and allow for the infiltration of water back into the ground rain garden plants are carefully chosen for their ability to withstand moisture extremes and potentially high concentrations of nutrients and sediments that are often found in stormwater runoff a well designed and maintained rain garden serves as an attractive component of an overall landscaping plan for a development site b a bioswale is a linear vegetative stormwater runoff conveyance system that is designed to store and infiltrate water from small storm events back into the ground and direct water from heavy rain events to appropriate form sewer inlets or other management facilities the flow of water being conveyed bioswale is slowed down allowing for municipal storm systems to more effectively manage heavier rain events and help reduce the risk of flooding on or offsite water being infiltrated or conveyed via a bioswale is also filtered by the vegetation within it generally improving both ground and surface water quality 2 requirements a the installation of a rain garden or bioswale may contribute to the overall stormwater management plan for a development site and count toward meeting the citys landscaping guidelines rain gardens may count for 20 points for every 20 square feet for yard area building foundation andor paved area requirements provided the following requirements are met b detailed plans shall be provided that show all proposed dimensions of the rain garden or bioswale including length width depth and slope of depression  location of the rain garden or bioswale on the lot relative to hardsurfaced areas downspouts and site topography  characteristics of the soil underlying the rain garden or bioswale  description of planting media  the species number and size at time of installation of all vegetation proposed for the rain garden or bioswale  and information on any other materials eg rocks that will be used to line the rain garden or bioswale c installation shall not be proposed for any of the following areas of a site 1 areas where there is known soil contamination unless the rain garden or bioswale is proposed to be constructed with an underdrain  2 areas where the characteristics of the soil would not allow for the proper infiltration of water into the ground  or 3 areas where there are expected to be high levels of foot traffic d the owner of the site shall demonstrate that the rain garden or bioswale shall be properly maintained  kept free of trash weeds debris and dead or dying plants  any pipes associated with the rain garden or bioswale will be inspected on an annual basis and kept free of debris  and by the beginning of every spring dead plant materials will be cut back or removed e bioswales and rain gardens shall be generously and appropriately vegetated to qualify for landscaping points bioswales and rain gardens or portions thereof that are lined with turf andor rocks but do not include other vegetation will not county toward meeting landscaping point requirements f rain gardens and bioswales may serve as a component of an overall stormwater management plan for a site only if detailed plans calculations and specifications are submitted detailed plans shall include the location

request for a variance may be made when an aggrieved party can submit proof that strict adherence to the provisions of this chapter would cause undue hardship or create conditions causing greater harmful effects than the initial condition a variance granted to a nonconforming use brings that use into conformance with the district and zoning requirements b the board of zoning appeals may authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where owning to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done no variance shall have the effect of allowing in any district uses prohibited in that district permit a lower degree of flood protection that the flood protection elevation for the particular area or permit standards lower than those required by state law c for the purposes of this section the term unnecessary hardship shall be defined as an unusual or extreme decrease in the adaptability of the property to the uses permitted by the zoning district which is caused by facts such as rough terrain or good soil conditions uniquely applicable to the particular piece of property as distinguished from those applicable to most or all property in the same zoning district 2 application the application for variance shall be filed with the zoning administrator applications may be made by the owner or lessee of the structure land or water to be affected the application is available at the city clerks office 3 public hearing a the application shall be referred to the board of zoning appeals the petitioner shall appear before the plan commission in order to answer questions b the board of zoning appeals shall conduct at least one public hearing on the proposed variance notice of such hearing shall be given not more than 30 days and not less than ten days before the hearing in one or more of the newspapers in general circulation in the city and shall give due notice to the parties in interest and the zoning administrator at the hearing the appellant or applicant may appear in person by agent or by attorney the board of zoning appeals shall thereafter reach its decision within 30 days after the final hearing and shall transmit a written copy of its decision to the appellant or applicant zoning administrator and plan commission 4 action of the board of zoning appeals for the board of zoning appeals to grant a variance it must find that a denial of variation may result in hardship to the property owner due to physiographical consideration there must be exceptional extraordinary or unusual circumstances or conditions applying to the lot or parcel structure use or intended use that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same district and the granting of the variance would not be of so general or recurrent nature as to suggest that this chapter should be changed b the conditions upon which a petition for a variation is based are unique to the property for which variation is being sought and that such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other properties in the same district and same vicinity c the purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to increase the value or income potential of the property d the granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located e the proposed variation will not undermine the spirit and general and specific purposes of this chapter 5 conditions the board of zoning appeals may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this section  3282013 interpretation 1 purpose the purpose of this section is to assign responsibility for the official interpretation of the provisions of this chapter and to describe the required procedure for securing such interpretation 2 initiation of request proceedings for an interpretation may be initiated by any of the following four methods an application of the owners of the subject property  a recommendation of the plan commission to the common council  by action of the common council  or by request of the zoning administrator 3 application a zoning interpretation application contains all of the following a clear indication of the text of this chapter for which the interpretation is requested and the specific questions the applicant has regarding said text b if the requested interpretation relates to the application of this a specific property the additional following information shall be required digital files should be submitted rather than paper copies whenever possible c a map of the subject property at a scale of 1   800 depicting 1 all lands for which the interpretation is requested and all other lands within 200 feet of the boundaries of the subject property 2 current zoning of the subject property and its environs and the jurisdictions which maintains that control 3 all lot dimensions of the subject property 4 a graphic scale and a north arrow d names and addresses of the owners of all lands on said map as the same appear on the current records of the register of deeds of columbia county e a written description of the reason for the requested interpretation and how the proposed interpretation relates to type of activities buildings and structures currently located on and proposed for the subject property f a site plan of the subject property as proposed for development said site plan shall conform to any and all the requirements of section 90474 g if the requested interpretation relates to the classification or treatment of a particular land use under the provisions of this a series of written responses to the following questions h how is the subject land use in general in harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the citys comprehensive plan this chapter and any other plan program or ordinance adopted or under consideration pursuant to official notice by the city i how is the subject land use in harmony with the purposes goals objectives policies and standards of the pertinent zoning district for which the interpretation is being sought 4 staff review a the zoning administrator shall review the application and evaluate and comment on the written justification for the proposed variance provided in the application to determine whether the requested variance is in harmony with the recommendations of citys comprehensive plan if the zoning administrator determines that the proposal may be in conflict with the provisions of the comprehensive plan the zoning administrator shall note this determination in the report 5 standards for review this chapter shall be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the purposes intended by the common council as noted in this chapter and the comprehensive plan the intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this chapter is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed modified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceed as follows a articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation is required rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit discussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated b articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the chapter design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this chapter is to be prohibited c determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party ie the adjoining landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this chapter similarly any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this chapter any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this chapter has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements 6 this chapter has been carefully designed by the common council to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options persons interpreting this chapter should not substitute their own judgments for the legislative acts of the common council 7 in addition to the applicants response to the questions required by subsection 5 above the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters a no interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the common council on an application for an amendment to the zoning ordinance the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation b no interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right a special use or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in the zoning district of the subject property see article ii c no interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject propertys zoning district see article ii d no interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category see article ii e if the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject propertys district than to a use permitted by right then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to section 90472 8 effect of a favorable land use interpretation no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development construction reconstruction alteration or moving of any building or structure a favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation filing and processing of applications for any permits and approvals which may be required by this chapter these permits and approvals include but are not limited to required site plans special use permits conditional uses and certificates of occupancy 9 limitations on favorable land use interpretation a no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be valid for a period of more than 365 days from the date of issuance of the interpretation unless a building permit is issued and development has begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or a certificate of occupancy is obtained and a use commenced within that period b an interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specified zoning district shall be deemed to authorize only that particular use at that particular location for which the interpretation was issued the interpretation shall not be deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate interpretation has not been issued a favorable interpretation shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it was issued shall for any reason be discontinued for a period of 365 consecutive days or more  3282013 appeal of zoning interpretation 1 purpose the purpose of this section is to provide regulations which enable the city to hear and decide requests for
