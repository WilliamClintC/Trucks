during active construction or after stabilization from both a technical and an economic standpoint 2 natural erosion during storm water runoff has always occurred and will continue at low rates from well stabilized areas it may cause stream turbidity scour and sedimentation regardless of the control measures applied during construction accelerated erosion will occur during storm water runoff with a proportionate increase in visible erosion scour and siltation both within and outside of the construction site 3 the following provisions impose requirement on persons engaged in land disturbing activities which require planning and implementation of effective sedimentation controls for subdivision development sites 4 the following provisions and requirements do not apply to silviculture agriculture and horticulture activities construction requirements an erosion and sedimentation control plan may be a part of the construction plans and filed with the city of bessemer prior to the commencement of any land disturbing activity determination of the requirement for an erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be made by the city engineer protection of property persons engaged in landdisturbing activities shall take all reasonable measures to protect all public and private property including roadways from damage by such activities more restrictive rules shall apply whenever there is a conflict between federal state or local laws ordinances rules and regulations orders and decrees the more restrictive provision shall apply basic control objectives 1 identify critical areas onsite areas which are subject to severe erosion and offsite areas which are especially vulnerable to damage from erosion andor sedimentation are to be identified and receive special attention 2 limit exposed areas all landdisturbing activities should be planned and conducted to minimize the size of the area to be exposed at any one time 3 limit time of exposure all landdisturbing activities should be planned and conducted to limit exposure to the shortest feasible time 4 control surface water surface water runoff originating upgrade of exposed areas should be controlled to reduce erosion and sediment loss during the period of exposure 5 control sedimentation all landdisturbing activities should be planned and conducted so as to minimize offsite sedimentation damage 6 manage storm water runoff when the increase in the peak rates and velocity of storm water runoff resulting from a landdisturbing activity is sufficient to cause damage accelerated erosion of the receiving ditch or channel stream plans should include measures to accelerated erosion and increased sedimentation of the ditch or stream channel mandatory standards 1 no landdisturbing activity shall be permitted in proximity to a lake natural watercourse or adjacent property where applicable unless a buffer zone is provided along the boundary of sufficient width to confine visible siltation andor prevent erosion provided that the landdisturbing activity is not in connection with the construction of the facilities to be located on over or under a lake natural watercourse or adjacent property 2 the angle for graded slopes shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or structures in any event slopes left exposed will within the shortest feasible time of final grading be planted or otherwise provided with ground cover devices or structures sufficient to restrain erosion 3 whenever landdisturbing activity is undertaken on a tract comprising more than one acre if more than one contiguous acre is uncovered a ground cover sufficient to restrain erosion should be planted or otherwise provided within 30 days on that portion of the tract upon which further active construction is not being undertaken provided that this activity shall not apply to cleared land forming the basin of reservoir later to be inundated design and performance standards erosion and sedimentation control measures structures and devices shall be so planted designed and constructed as to provide control from the calculated peak rates of runoff from tenyear frequency storm runoff rates may be calculated using the procedures in the usda soil conservation services national engineering field manual for conservation practices or other accepted calculation procedures runoff computations shall be based on rainfall data published by this national weather service for the area permanent downstream protection of stream banks and channels 1 a combination of storage and controlled release of storm water runoff may be required for highway construction  commercial industrial educational and institutional developments of one acre or more  for multifamily residential developments of five acres or more  and for singlefamily development of ten acres or more 2 detention storage and controlled release will not be required in those instances where the person planning to conduct the activity can demonstrate that the storm water release will not cause an increase in accelerated erosion or sedimentation of the receiving ditch stream channel or other drainage facility taking into consideration any anticipated development of the watershed in question borrow and waste areas when the person conducting the landdisturbing activity is also the person conducting the borrow or waste disposal activity areas from which borrow is obtained shall be considered part of the landdisturbing activity where the borrow material is being used or from which the waste material originated when the person conducting the landdisturbing activity is not the person obtaining the borrow andor disposing of the waste these acres shall be considered a separate landdisturbing activity access and haul roads temporary access and haul roads other than public roads constructed or used in connection with any landdisturbing activity shall be considered a part of such activity operations in lakes or natural watercourses landdisturbing activity in connection with construction in on over or under a lake or natural watercourse shall be planned and conducted in such a manner as to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream channel the relocation of a stream where relocation is an essential part of the proposed activity shall be planned and executed so as to minimize changes in the stream flow characteristics except when justification for significant alteration to flow characteristics is provided resonsibility for maintenance the person engaged in or conducting the landdisturbing activity shall be responsible for maintaining all temporary and permanent erosion and sedimentation measures and facilities during the development of a site the responsibility for maintaining all permanent erosion and sedimentation control measure and facilities after site development is completed shall lie with the landowner until such time adequate vegetative cover and site stabilization is achieved by the building inspector standards for erosion and sediment control practices persons engaged in planning designing installing and maintaining sedimentation control measures may use generally accepted references on the subject following standard engineering andor agricultural practices all plans will be subject to review by city engineer additional measures whenever the building inspector determines that significant sedimentation is occurring as a result of landdisturbing activity despite application and maintenance of protective practice the person conducting the landdisturbing activity or the person responsible for maintenance will be required to take additional protective action plan requirement 1 whenever the area to be disturbed comprises more than one acre a copy of the plan shall be filed with the building inspector a minimum of 30 days prior to beginning any landdisturbing activity a copy of the plans shall also be on file at the job site if the building official determines either upon review of such plan or on inspection of the job site that a significant risk of offsite sedimentation of erosion exists it will require a revised plan prepared pending the preparation of the revised plan the work shall be either suspended or continued under conditions outlined by the building inspector 2 erosion and sediment control plans shall contain architectural and engineering drawings maps assumptions calculations and narrative statements as needed to describe adequately the proposed development of the site and the measures planned to meet the basic control objectives plan content may vary to meet the need of specific site conditions appendix 1a  resurvey plat checklist bessemer
