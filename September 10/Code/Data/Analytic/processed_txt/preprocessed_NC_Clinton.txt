communicated newspaper with general circulation in clinton psa announcements on local radio and cable stations and the citys website  declaration of emergency water restrictions or water rationing will be communicated to all customers by telephone  levels of response five 5 levels of water shortage response are outlined in the table below the five 5 levels of water shortage response are voluntary reductions mandatory reductions i and ii emergency reductions and water rationing a detailed description of each response level and corresponding water reduction measures follow below stage response description 1 voluntary reductions water users are encouraged to reduce their water use and improve water use efficiency  however no penalties apply for noncompliance water supply conditions indicate a potential for shortage 2 mandatory reductions i water users must abide required water use reduction and efficiency measures  penalties apply for noncompliance water supply conditions are significantly lower than the seasonal norm and water shortage conditions are expected to persist 3 mandatory reductions ii same as in stage 2 4 emergency reductions water supply conditions are substantially diminished and pose an imminent threat to human health or environmental integrity 5 water rationing water supply conditions are substantially diminished and remaining supplies must be allocated to preserve human health and environmental integrity in stage 1 voluntary reductions all water users will be asked to reduce their normal water use by five 5 percent customer education and outreach programs will encourage water conservation and efficiency measures including irrigating landscapes a maximum of one 1 inch per week  preventing water waste runoff and watering impervious surfaces  watering plants deeply to encourage root growth  washing only full loads in clothes and dishwashers  using springloaded nozzles on garden hoses  and identifying and repairing all water leaks in stage 2 mandatory reductions i all customers are expected to reduce their water use by ten 10 percent in comparison to their previous months water bill in addition to continuing to encourage all voluntary reduction actions the following restrictions apply irrigation is limited to a halfinch 12 per week between  pm and  am  outdoor use of drinking water for washing impervious surfaces is prohibited  and all testing and training purposes requiring drinking water eg fire protection will be limited in stage 3 mandatory reductions ii customers must continue actions from all previous stages and further reduce water use by twenty 20 percent compared to their previous months water bill all nonessential uses of drinking water are banned and garden and landscape irrigation must be reduced to the minimum amount necessary for survival additionally in stage 3 a drought surcharge of one and fivetenths 15 times the normal water rate may be applied in stage 4 emergency reductions customers must continue all actions from previous stages and further reduce their water use by twentyfive 25 percent compared to their previous months water bill a ban on all use of drinking water except to protect public health and safety is implemented and drought surcharges of two 2 times the normal water rate may be applied in stage 5 water rationing is to provide drinking water to protect public health eg residences residential health care facilities and correctional facilities in stage 5 all customers are only permitted to use water at the minimum required for public health protection firefighting is the only allowable outdoor water use and pickup locations for distributing potable water will be announced according to clintons emergency response plan drought surcharges of five 5 times the normal water rate may be applied  triggers clintons water source is groundwater the following measurements of well pumping times and well levels in relationship to pump intake levels trigger entry into corresponding water restriction stages stage well operating conditions 1 pumping time >10 hrs twenty 20 percent reduction in seasonal normal distance from static water level and pump intake twenty 20 percent increase pumping time for same output 2 pumping time >12 hrs forty 40 percent reduction in distance from static water level and pump intake forty 40 percent increase pumping time for

with another principal use and the former use 1 constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot or 2 is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried on underneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use for example a swimming 37 city of clinton land development  zoning districts pooltennis court complex is customarily associated with and integrally related to a residential subdivision or multifamily development and would be regarded as accessory to such principal uses even though such facilities if developed apart from a residential development would require a conditional use permit b for purposes of interpreting a 1 a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use 2 to be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness c without limiting the generality of subsections a and b the following activities are specifically regarded as accessory uses to residential principal uses as long as they satisfy the general criteria set forth above 1 yard sales or garage sales of personal property on the residential premises owned or rented for residential purpose by the seller so long as such sales are not conducted on the same lot for more than four 4 days consecutive or not during any one 1 year period 2 towers and antennas as long as

city of the rightofway   change in use a a substantial change in use of property occurs whenever the essential character or nature of the activity conducted on a lot changes this occurs whenever 1 the change involves a change from one principal use category to another  2 if the original use is a combination use the relative proportion of space devoted to the individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes to such an extent that the parking requirements for the overall use are altered  3 if the original use is a combination use the mixture of the types of individual principal uses that comprise the combination use changes  4 if there is only one business or enterprise conducted on the lot regardless of whether the business or enterprise consists of one individual principal use or combination use that business or enterprise moves out and a different type of enterprise moves in even though the new business or enterprise may be classified under the same principal use or combination use category as the previous type of business for example if there is only one building on a lot and a florist shop that is the sole tenant of that building moves out and is replaced by a clothing store that constitutes a change in use even though both tenants fall within the same principal use classification however if the florist shop were replaced with another florist shop that would not constitute a change in use since the type of business or enterprise would not have changed moreover if the florist shop moved out of a rented space in a shopping center and was replaced by a clothing store that would not constitute a change in use since there is more than one business on the lot and the essential character of the activity conducted on that lot shopping centercombination use has not changed b a mere change in the status of property from unoccupied to occupied or vice versa does not constitute a change in use whether a change in use occurs shall be determined by comparing the two 2 active uses of the property without regard to any intervening time 39 city of clinton land development  zoning districts period during which the property may have been unoccupied unless the property has remained unoccupied for more than 180 days or has been abandoned c a mere change in ownership of a business or enterprise or a change in name shall not be regarded as a change in use  combination uses when a combination use comprises two 2 or more principal uses that require different types of permits zoning or conditional use then the permit authorizing the combination use shall be a a conditional use permit if any of the principal uses combined requires a conditional use permit  b a zoning permit in all other cases  more specific controls whenever a development could

by a change in the classification of property or the text of these regulations shall be regulated by the provisions of this nonconformities may continue but the provisions of this designed to minimize substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about eventual elimination andor lessen their impact upon surrounding conforming properties in order to preserve the integrity of the area in which it is located and the intent of this 2 continuation of nonconforming situations a unless otherwise provided in this subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this be continued b in the airport height overlay aho district the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree shall be required to permit the installation operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the administrator to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the clintonsampson county airport the presence of such airport obstruction such markers and lights shall be installed operated and maintained at the expense of the airport if by a determination of the north carolina division of aviation or federal aviation administration the encroachment of any structure or tree into regulated airspace is such that providing markers and lights is insufficient to protect the life and property of the flying public the applicable authority shall institute steps to have such structures or trees mitigated at the expense of the applicable authority if unsuccessful in obtaining the cooperation of the parties involved the city shall institute the appropriate legal action as reasonably necessary to insure the safety of the flying public in airspace regulated by this 3 nonconforming when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimum for the zoning district then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming however no use eg a twofamily dwelling that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zoning district is permissible on a nonconforming lot b if a nonconforming lot fails to meet lot area or width requirements or both in a district where singlefamily residences are permitted such lot may be used as the location of a singlefamily dwelling with related accessory buildings the board of adjustment may allow a 20 percent reduction in the applicable setback requirements if it finds that 133 city of clinton land development  nonconformities 1 the property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations 2 these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot and 3 the property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health and safety c for purposes of b mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible d this only to undeveloped nonconforming lots a lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it a change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with e if two 2 or more adjoining and vacant lots of record are in single ownership at any time after the adoption of this such lots individually have less frontage or area than the minimum requirement of the district in which such lots are located such lots shall be considered as a single zoning lot of several lots which meet the minimum requirements of this the district in which such lots are located extension or enlargement of nonconformities a except as specifically provided in this no person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in 1 an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use or 2 greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements b subject to d a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use however subject to a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building c subject to a nonconforming use of open land may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming except that a use that involves the removal of natural material from the lot eg a sand pit may be expanded to the boundaries of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if 10 percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a 134 city of clinton land development  nonconformities nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other subsections of this e notwithstanding a any structure used for singlefamily residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements eg where allowed a singlewide manufactured home may be replaced with a doublewide manufactured home this subject to the limitations stated in f notwithstanding a whenever i there exists a lot with one or more structures on it and ii a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot and iii the parking or loading requirements of parking that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation however the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without acquiring additional land and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with parking if i parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required and ii such satellite parking is reasonably available if such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or conditional use permit is granted then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it does become reasonably available this requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit repairs maintenance and reconstruction a minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged major renovation ie work estimated to cost more than 50 percent of its replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure as the case may be may be done only in accordance with a zoning permit pursuant to this if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with a zoning permit issued pursuant to this not apply to structures used for singlefamily residential purposes including manufactured homes which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to a zoning permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in e of c for purposes of subsections a and b 135 city of clinton land development  nonconformities 1 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the current fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation repair or replacement 2 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work and no person may seek to avoid the intent of subsections a or b by doing such work incrementally 3 the administrator may require the applicant to provide an appraisal to establish the cost d the administrator shall issue a zoning permit authorized by this heshe finds that in completing the renovation repair or replacement work 1 no violation of extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations will occur and 2 the permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this to the existing use except that the permittee shall not lose hisher right to continue a nonconforming use change in use of property where nonconformity exists a a change in use of property that is sufficiently substantial to require a new zoning permit or conditional use permit may not be made except in accordance with subsections b d however this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed b if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status c if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this issue a permit for that particular use the administrator or city council issues a permit authorizing the change this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds in addition to any other findings that may be required by this that 1 the intended change will not result in a violation of extension and enlargement of nonconforming situations  and 2 all of the applicable requirements of this can reasonably be complied with will be complied with d compliance with a requirement of this not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible and in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this construct a 136 city of clinton land development  nonconformities building or to add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created e if the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this issue a permit for that particular use administrator or city council issues a permit authorizing the change the permitissuing authority may issue the permit if it finds in addition to other findings that may be required by this that 1 the use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either a zoning or conditional use permit and 2 all of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in c of this satisfied and 3 the proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for abandonment & discontinuance of nonconformities a except as provided in e when a nonconforming use is i discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or ii discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes b if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is i discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days or ii discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected c for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one 1 apartment in a nonconforming apartment building or one space in a nonconforming manufactured home park for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building or manufactured home park as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter and so if a manufactured home is used as a nonconforming use on a residential lot where a conforming residential structure also is located removal of that manufactured home for 180 days determines the right to replace it 137 city of clinton land development  nonconformities d when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this vacant or discontinued at the effective date of this the 180 day period for purposes of this to run on the effective date of this in the airport height overlay aho district whenever the administrator determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down physically deteriorated or decayed no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed 49 feet in height otherwise deviate from applicable within the airport height overlay aho district completion of nonconforming projects a all nonconforming projects on which construction was begun at least 180 days before the effective date of this as well as all nonconforming projects that are at least 10% completed in terms of the total expected cost of the project on the effective date of this may be completed in accordance with the terms of their permits so long as their permits were validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired if a development is designed to be completed in stages this apply only to the particular phase under construction b except as provided in a all work on any nonconforming project shall cease on the effective date of this all permits previously issued for work on nonconforming projects may begin or may be continued only pursuant to a zoning conditional use or sign permit issued in accordance with this the individual or board authorized by this issue permits for the type of development proposed the permitissuing authority shall issue such a permit if it finds that the applicant has in good faith made substantial expenditures or incurred substantial binding obligations or otherwise changed hisher position in some substantial way in reasonable reliance on the land use law as it existed before the date of this project as proposed in considering whether these findings may be made the permitissuing authority shall be guided by the following as well as other relevant considerations 1 all expenditures made to obtain or pursuant to a validly issued and unrevoked building zoning sign or conditional use permit shall be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this effective  2 except as provided in b1 no expenditures made more than 180 days before the effective date of this be considered as evidence of reasonable reliance on the land use law that existed before this effective an expenditure is made at the time a party incurs a binding obligation to make that expenditure  3 to the extent that expenditures are recoverable with a reasonable effort a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made those expenditures for example a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made some expenditure to acquire a potential development site if the property obtained is approximately as valuable under the new 138 city of clinton land development  nonconformities classification as it was under the old for the expenditure can be recovered by a resale of the property  4 to the extent that a nonconforming project can be made conforming and that expenditures made or obligations incurred can be effectively utilized in the completion of a conforming project a party shall not be considered prejudiced by having made such expenditures  5 an expenditure shall be considered substantial if it is significant both in dollar amount and in terms of i the total estimated cost of the proposed project and ii the ordinary business practices of the developer  6 a person shall be considered to have acted in good faith if actual knowledge of a proposed change in land use law affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to himher  7 even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the land use law affecting a development site the permitissuing authority may still find that heshe acted in good faith if heshe did not proceed with hisher plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed permitissuing authority may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed it determines that i at the time the expenditures were made either there was considerable doubt about whether any ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed prohibit the intended development and ii the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures c when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing under b in addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in 1 6 of b the permitissuing authority shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1 whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work  2 whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed  3 whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or such a scale in anticipation of connection to or interrelationship with approved but uncompleted phases that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations d the permitissuing authority shall not consider any application for the permit authorized by b that is submitted more than 60 days after the effective date of this permitissuing authority may waive this requirement for good cause shown but in no case may it extend the application deadline beyond one year 139 city of clinton land development  nonconformities e the permitissuing authority shall establish expedited procedures for hearing applications for permits under this applications shall be heard whenever possible before the effective date of this so that construction work is not needlessly interrupted authorization of nonconforming projects whenever an amendment to this effective after an application for a development
