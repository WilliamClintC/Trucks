threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the

code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections

adjacent to the parcel or lot which is being partitioned or subdivided must be a fully developed city street unless an exception is granted as per the following standards and procedures 1 partitions and subdivision of land that require the creation of a public street to serve the proposed lots shall comply with the requirements of the adopted street standards and shall include the public dedication of the required rightofway in the adopted street standards except as varied under   2 partitions and subdivision of land with frontage along an existing city county or state street or that are accessed via an existing city county or state street shall be required to make such improvements as necessary to address the impacts of the proposed development on those streets provided the required improvements are roughly proportional to the impacts created by the proposed development if the required improvements are roughly proportional to the impacts created by the proposed development but the planning commission determines that because of the existing street conditions topography or other similar factor that requiring the improvements to be completed prior to platting the property is an inefficient method of obtaining the improvements the planning commission can allow the applicant to provide a deferred improvement agreement bond irrevocable petition for public improvements or similar mechanism for obtaining the completion of the required improvements at a later date c relation to the adjoining street system major partitions and subdivisions shall provide

for the neighborhood or area of which the partition or subdivision is a part the partition or subdivision shall conform to such neighborhood or area plan if the topographical conditions make such continuation or conformity impractical adjustments or variances may be approved under d density all subdivisions within residential zones shall create enough lots to allow building residential units to meet the higher of the following density standards 1 fifty 50 percent or more of the maximum net density permitted based upon the minimum lot size for a singlefamily residence  or 2 eighty 80 percent or more of the maximum net density permitted based upon the minimum lot size for a singlefamily residence minus all areas which have slopes of fifteen 15 percent or more are wetlands or have other topographical features which in the opinion of the planning commission preclude development of portions of the site because to develop those portions would require noncompliance with the comprehensive plan development ordinances or design standards 3 example a the following example is to act as a guide to meeting this standard a ten 10 acre parcel is to be subdivided a street will be provided and dedicated to the public the street will remove two acres from the usable space for lots leaving a net of eight acres the property is zoned rg which has a minimum lot size of six thousand 6000 square feet thus the calculation for the minimum number of lots to be provided is 10 acres  2 acres   8 acres net buildable 8 acres x 43560 square feet   348480 square feet 348480 square feet6000 square feet   5808 lots 5808 lots x 50   2904 units 2904 units is rounded to 29 units minimum required b the following example is to act as a guide to meeting this standard a ten 10 acre parcel is to be subdivided a street will be provided and dedicated to the public the street will remove two acres from the usable space for lots leaving a net of eight acres however there are three acres of wetlands and one and onehalf acres which have greater than fifteen 15 percent slopes thus the net net developable area is three and onehalf acres the property is zoned rg which has a minimum lot size of six thousand 6000 square feet thus the calculation for the minimum number of lots to be provided is 10 acres  2 acres   8 acres net 8 acres  3 acres  15 acres   35 acres net buildable 35 acres x 43560 square feet   152460 square feet 152460 square feet6000 square feet   2541 lots 2541 lots x 80   2033 2033 units is rounded to 20 units minimum required twentynine 29 units required is greater than twenty 20 units required therefore twentynine 29 lots must be created for the subdivision to be approved these units will have to be clustered away from the wetlands and the fifteen 15 percent slope areas as a special note to provide additional guidance to the planning commission if there are areas which cannot be served due to topographical reasons such as the roads cannot be built to meet the citys standards all of the undevelopable area could be excluded by the planning commission in calculating the minimum density required 4 all partitions within residential zones where the subject parcel can be further partitioned shall be partitioned in a manner that does not preclude the efficient division of land in the future e parcels topography or past development patterns 1 every lot and

two and onehalf to one parcels over twentyfive thousand 25000 square feet in area must not exceed a depth to width ratio of three and onehalf to one 7 flag lots may not be created such that more than two driveways for individual lots are in less than seventyfive 75 foot of street frontage 8 existing natural and piped drainages must be preserved or replaced on the site and easements must be granted

adjustments requests for changes to standards which are not numeric or which are for more than ten 10 percent of the standard are processed as variances  9172014   adjustmentprocedure adjustment requests are processed type ii procedure using the review criteria listed in addition to the applicable requirements contained in  9172014   adjustmentreview criteria all adjustment requests will be approved if the city manager finds that the applicant has shown that the following criteria have been met 1 the requested adjustment is for ten 10 percent or less of the numerical development standard  2 the need for the requested adjustment is created by the configuration of an existing or proposed structure on the site  3 the need for the requested adjustment is created by the configuration of the existing lot boundaries or topography of the site  4 the design and operating characteristics of the proposed development are reasonably compatible with the placement of surrounding development and land uses and any negative impacts have been sufficiently minimized  or 5 if more than one adjustment is being requested the cumulative effect of the adjustments will result in a project which is still consistent with the overall purpose of the applicable zoning district  9172014   variancespurpose this section provides standards and procedures for variances which are modifications to the development standards in title 16 of this code that are not otherwise permitted elsewhere in this code as exceptions to code standards this code cannot provide standards to fit every potential development situation the citys varied geography and complexities of land development require flexibility this chapter provides that flexibility while maintaining the purposes and intent of the code the variance procedure provides relief from specific code provisions in title 16 when they have the unintended effect of preventing reasonable development that is in conformance with all other codes the variance procedure is intended to provide flexibility while ensuring that the purpose of each development standard is met variances are necessary when the applicant requests a deviation from numerical standards of more than ten 10 percent or a variance from nonnumerical development standards  9172014   varianceprocedure a variance is processed as a type iii procedure using the review criteria listed in addition to the applicable procedures contained in  9172014   regulations which may and may not be varied a unless listed in subsection b of this section all regulations in this code may be modified using the variance process b variances are prohibited for the following items 1 as an exception to any restrictions on uses or development which contain the word prohibited 2 as an exception to a threshold for a review such as the characteristics that would distinguish a minor partition from a major partition or subdivision 3 as an exception to a definition or classification 4 as an exception to the procedural steps of a procedure or to change assigned procedures  9172014   variancereview criteria the planning commission may approve an application for a variance if the applicant has shown that all of the following criteria have been met a the proposed variance will not be materially detrimental to the purposes of this code to any other applicable policies and standards and to other properties in the same zoning district or in the vicinity  b a hardship to development exists that is peculiar to the lot size or shape topography preexisting structures wetlands floodplains or other similar circumstances related to the property over which the applicant has no control and that are not applicable to other properties in the vicinity  c the development proposed will be the same as permitted under this title and city standards will be maintained to the greatest extent that is reasonably possible while permitting reasonable economic use of the land  d

flexibility to development standards in recognition of the complexity and wide variation of site development opportunities and constraints in toledo the variance procedures are intended to provide flexibility while ensuring that the purpose of each development standard is met because some variances are granted using clear and objective standards and the impact if any on adjacent property owners is negligible they can be granted by means of a type i procedure other variances as identified below require a type ii or type iii procedure because they involve discretionary decisionmaking or the potential for more substantial changes that may have some impact on the adjacent property owners  part 2001   classes of variances three types of variances shall be allowed under the zoning regulation a a class a variance is a variance requiring staff level approval only and is intended to apply to situations where the exercise of discretion by staff is minimal because the factual situation is relatively straightforward a class a variance is reviewed type i procedure and a decision on the class a variance is the final decision of the city b a class b variance is a variance requiring staff level approval and is intended to apply to situations which require a greater exercise of discretion and in which the factual situation is complex a class b variance is reviewed as a type il procedure and a decision on the class b variance may be appealed to the planning commission c a class c variance is a variance requiring planning commission approval and is intended to apply to situations in which the exercise of discretion is greater and the factual situation may be complex a class c variance is reviewed as a type iii procedure and a decision on the class c variance may be appealed to the city council  part 2001   class avariances after determining that the applicable conditions exist the city manager shall grant a request for a variance to the following ordinance requirements a class avariance to front yard setback requirements in the case of residential dwellings the following variance to the front yard setback requirement is authorized for a lot in any zone if there are dwellings on both abutting lots with front yards of less than the required depth for the zone the front yard for the lot need not exceed the average front yard of the abutting dwellings if there is a dwelling on one abutting lot with a front yard of less than the required depth for the zone the depth of the front yard for the lot need not exceed a depth onehalf way between the depth of the abutting lot and the required front yard depth b class avariance to building height limitations a variance for the following types of structures or structural parts from the building height requirements of this ordinance are allowed as long as they do not exceed fifty 50 feet from grade chimneys cupolas tanks church spires belfries domes derricks monuments fire and hose towers observation towers transmission towers smokestacks flagpoles radio and television towers masts aerials cooling towers water towers elevator shafts windmills conveyors and other similar projections c class avariance for home occupation employees home occupations do not allow for onsite employees a variance from this provision would allow up to one fulltime equivalent employee forty 40 hours per week an offstreet parking space must be available to the employee there can only be one employee onsite at a time a site plan and employee schedule must be part of the application fulltime equivalent employee does not include contract service workers that are not specifically required for the home occupation such as but not limited to contractors house cleaning handyman and landscapers d class avariance to front yard setback for unenclosed porchesdecks a variance for unenclosed porchesdecks is allowed for intrusion into an established front yard setback of up to seven feet as long as there is no encroachment into a public utility easement  2005   part 2001   class bvariances a class bvariance to setbacks a variance to the front yard setback requirement of up to five feet and for any other setback up to fifty 50 percent is authorized as follows 1 for residential zones a majority of houses on an existing block have front yard setbacks of less than the required depth and the number of vacant lots does not exceed twenty 20 percent of the total lots on the block or 2 the topography of the lot such as steep slopes or the location of a natural drainage source such as an intermittent stream makes it difficult to build to the yard setback requirement or 3 the variance would allow the preservation of an existing trees or other natural resource and 4 the variance would not create any public safety issues such as a clearvision problem b class bvariance to vehicular access and circulation standards where vehicular access and circulation cannot be reasonably designed to conform to code standards within a particular parcel shared access with an adjoining property shall be considered if shared access in conjunction with another parcel is not feasible the city may grant a variance to the access requirements after finding the following 1 there is not adequate physical space for shared access or the owners of abutting properties do not agree to execute a joint access easement 2 there are no alternative access points on the street in question or from another street 3 the request is the minimum adjustment required to provide adequate access 4 the approved access or access approved with conditions will result in a safe access and 5 the clearvision requirements will be met c class bvariance to parking requirements variances to the municipal parking requirements are authorized in the commercial light industrial and industrial zones of up to twenty 20 percent of the required offstreet parking if 1 topographical conditions exist on the lot such as steep slopes location of natural drainage course or high groundwater table or 2 the variance would allow the preservation of trees or other natural resource and 3 adequate setbacks clear vision access and compliance with the americans with disabilities act requirements are assured and 4 the proposal comes as close to meeting ordinance requirements as conditions allow d class bvariance to rebuild a destroyed nonconforming structure rebuilding a partially damaged nonconforming structure as long as it is not made to be more nonconforming it also precludes the rebuilding of a totally destroyed nonconforming structure a variance to this section can be applied for and will be evaluated against the following criteria 1 public response  2 livability and effects on adjacent and surrounding properties  3 circumstances pertinent to the property in question that are beyond the control of the applicant  4 no other provisions of the municipal codes are violated  5 effected natural resources  6 no public safety issues are created  7 the requested variance is the minimum necessary  2005   part 2001   class cvariances a class cvariance to lot size the planning commission may grant a variance to the minimum lot size requirements in the singlefamily residential and the general residential zones if 1 there is a peculiarity in lot configuration for lots of record existing prior to 198 or 2 the variance would alleviate an existing nonconforming use or structure and 3 setbacks clear vision access and offstreet parking requirements are met and 4 the variance would not unduly burden city services such as streets parks water and sewer and 5 the new lot or lots are no less than eightythree 83 percent of the size required by the ordinance b class cvariance to building height the planning commission may grant a variance to the building height limitation in residential zones if 1 the lot size is increased by twenty 20 square feet over the minimum lot size requirement for every five feet

and 3 treating the multiple lots as one lot for municipal code purposes would not result in the violation of other sections of the municipal code or other applicable codes  and 4 the topography of the legal lots is such that except for the topography of the property the proposed permitted use outright necessitating the request for a restrictive lot line covenant could be accommodated on one lot  or 5 significant alterations of steep slopes wetlands natural drainage patterns or other natural resources can be minimized by treating the abutting legal lots as one lot  or 6 the size of the legal lots is such that one or more of the lots are substandard but together the lots meet the size requirements for the applicable zone  or 7 the use proposed is an approved conditional use and the nature of the use is such that if the conditional use was located in a zone where the use was permitted outright the interior lot lines between the abutting properties would not require setbacks  or 8 open
