customer leases three t1 telephone lines at $400 per month to connect to mci gross revenues from municipality a are computed separately for each line as follows the first connects a location in municipality b to an mci point of presence in municipality a $200 per month is the gross revenues from municipality a for this service 12 x $400 the second connects a location in municipality a to the same mci point of presence ar $400 is gross revenues from municipality a for this service the third connects a location in municipality c to a different mci point of presence located in municipality d

municipality a as follows $25000 half of the $50000 is included because all the circuits wherever the customer is located connect to the point of presence in municipality a  ie each customer circuit is composed of two locations one at the customer one at sprint one of which is in municipality a $16667 2842 of $25000 because the other half of the $50000 is attributable to the specific customer

the actual costs incurred by the township in enforcing this article against the person if a telecommunications provider negotiates a consent agreement with the township under the provisions of  701823 and the township determines that the consent agreement substantially satisfies the obligations of a telecommunications provider under this article giving due regard to any special circumstances involving the telecommunications provider the consent agreement will be deemed to satisfy the requirement of a permit under this article and under the michigan telecommunications act mcl   et seq when a consent agreement is no longer in effect the telecommunications provider shall be required to comply with all terms and conditions of this article as it may be amended from time to time  70182 reservation of right  the issuance of a permit or permits under this article and the access to and use of the public rightsofway by a telecommunications provider shall not constitute a waiver of or otherwise adversely affect the following reserved rights right to require franchise  of the 1963 michigan constitution requires that all public utilities obtain a franchise to conduct a local business within the township the applicability of this requirement to telecommunications providers may be challenged under  102dd of the michigan telecommunications act mcl  dd which purports to define telecommunications services as not constituting public utility services due to this and other legal and regulatory issues and to avoid the expense and delay of litigation that may be unnecessary the township hereby determines that telecommunications providers shall not be required at this time to obtain franchises for the transaction of local business within the township telecommunications providers shall be required to obtain and maintain a permit for access to and ongoing use of the public rightsofway and to otherwise comply with the terms of this article such a permit shall not constitute a franchise the township reserves the right to require telecommunications providers to obtain a franchise in the future to transact local business within the township the permittee shall not provide cable service without obtaining a franchise from the township rights regarding takings claim certain cable or telecommunications providers have initiated or supported legal proceedings in which they contend that federal law grants them the right to physically occupy the rightsofway and other property of a municipality for the purpose of providing telecommunications service without compensating the municipality for the use or value of the property so occupied or the cost of acquiring and maintaining such property municipalities  charter township of meridian ecode360  275591 3 a b dispute that claim the township believes that if such a claim were sustained it would among other things constitute an unlawful taking by the united states in violation of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution the legal issues involved in such disputes have not been finally decided the township desires to act on applications for permits granting access to its public rightsofway at this time rather than wait for determination of these issues provided this can be done without waiver or loss of any rights of the township or a permittee therefore notwithstanding any other provision hereof a permittee is not precluded by this article from seeking relief from the fee provisions of  70185 from any court or agency of competent jurisdiction if a permittee seeks such relief the township reserves the right to assert a takings claim and to take all action it deems necessary in support thereof neither this article nor the issuance or acceptance of a permit under this article constitutes or will be claimed to constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any rights or defenses of either the township or the permittee in connection with these disputed issues and the acceptance of a permit constitutes an acknowledgment and agreement thereto by the permittee option to obtain consent agreement the township finds that legislative legal and regulatory issues in connection with use of the public rightsofway by telecommunications providers and the resulting potential for litigation and delay are likely to have an adverse impact on the development of a healthy competitive telecommunications infrastructure in the community this would be detrimental to the township and its residents as well as to telecommunications providers the issues affect among other things both the cost to telecommunications providers and compensation to the township for the maintenance and use of its public rightsofway in order to promote certainty encourage competition and avoid litigation the township will at the request and sole option of an applicant or permittee consider entering into a consent agreement for use of the public rightsofway for the provision of telecommunications services on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the township and the telecommunications provider it is the townships intent that such an agreement would satisfy the requirement for a permit under this article and would include among other things a fee of up to 5% of the applicable gross revenues of the telecommunications provider which would include the permit fee  an extended term of up to 15 years  authorization to conduct a local business in the township pursuant to  of the 1963 michigan constitution  and a covenant to abide by the terms of the agreement as a compromise of disputed issues and uncertain outcomes notwithstanding the resolution of these legislative regulatory and legal requirements in the future a permittee may request a consent agreement at any time  70183

findings a primary function of grand river avenue m43 is to move traffic township and to points beyond as the primary arterial road for meridian township and many of the communities along the corridor a high percentage of the traffic has an origin and or destination in the local communities thus grand river avenue m43 also has a secondary but important function to provide access to adjacent and nearby land uses continued development along the grand river avenue m43 corridor will increase traffic volumes and introduce additional conflict points which will further erode traffic operations and increase potential for crashes numerous published studies and reports document the relationship between systems and traffic operations and safety those reports and experiences of other communities demonstrate standards on the number and placement of access points driveways and side street intersections that can preserve the capacity of the roadway and reduce the potential for crashes the standards herein are based on recommendations published by various national and michigan agencies that were refined during preparation of the m4352 corridor access management plan dated july 2003 the charter township of meridian finds that special comprehensive zoning standards are needed along the grand river avenue m43 corridor based upon the following findings the combination of roadway design traffic speeds current and projected traffic volumes traffic crashes and other characteristics necessitate special access standards studies by transportation organizations in michigan and nationally have found a direct correlation between the number of access points and the number of crashes the standards are based upon considerable research and recommendations contained within the michigan department of transportation mdot access management handbook preservation of roadway capacity management protects the substantial public investment in the roadway system and helps avoid the need for costly reconstruction which disrupts businesses purpose the michigan department of transportation mdot has jurisdiction within the highways rightofway while the charter township of meridian has authority for land use and site plan decisions within individual lots or parcels along the highway the access management standards were created to help ensure a collaborative process between the mdot and the charter township of meridian on access decisions along grand river avenue m43 to implement the recommendations of the m4352 corridor access management plan dated july 2003 and other adopted charter township of meridian plans among the specific purposes of this corridor access management overlay district are to preserve the capacity of grand river avenue m43 by limiting and controlling the number location and design of access points and requiring alternate means of access driveways service drives and access off cross streets in certain locations encourage efficient flow of traffic by minimizing the disruption and conflicts between turning movements improve safety and reduce the potential for crashes avoid the proliferation of unnecessary curb cuts and driveways and eliminate or
