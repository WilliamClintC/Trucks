free from sexual harassment sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations it is a policy of the city to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official municipal agent municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender all municipal officials municipal agents municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof bdefinition of sexual harassment this policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the illinois human rights act which currently defines sexual harassment as 1any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when asubmission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individuals employment  bsubmission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual  or csuch conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individuals work performance or creating an intimidating hostile or offensive working environment 2conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes averbal sexual innuendos suggestive comments insults humor and jokes about sex anatomy or genderspecific traits sexual propositions threats repeated requests for dates or statements about other employees even outside of their presence of a sexual nature bnonverbal suggestive or insulting sounds whistling leering obscene gestures sexually suggestive bodily gestures catcalls smacking or kissing noises cvisual posters signs pinups or slogans of a sexual nature viewing pornographic material or websites dphysical touching unwelcome hugging or kissing pinching brushing the body any coerced sexual act or actual assault etextualelectronic sexting electronically sending messages with sexual content including pictures and video the use of sexually explicit language harassment cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic communication email textpicturevideo messages internetonline postings blogs instant messages and social network websites like facebook and twitter 3the most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine on the other end of the spectrum some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends to some extent on individual perception and interpretation the courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a reasonable person cprocedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment 1an employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herselfhimself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incidents as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating herhis position to the offending employee and herhis immediate supervisor it is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report 2any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment including the following aelectronicdirect communication if there is sexual harassing behavior in the workplace the harassed employee should directly and clearly express herhis objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop the initial
