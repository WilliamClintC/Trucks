pretreatment standards users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 1 where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the control authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsection f5 and 6 2 when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the control authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users 3 when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the control authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e 4 a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section note see 40 cfr 40315 a categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for are met b criteria 1 either i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters 2 credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere 3 credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section 4 credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result 5 when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the control authority the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsection f5a1 below a to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must 1 employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  2 currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  3 provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  4 not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and 5 have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits b an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must 1 maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  2 continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3 continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the control authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 per cent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection f5a3 of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the control authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 4 continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection f5a1 of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit c when developing equivalent mass limits the control authority 1 will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2 upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3 may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 2175 j the industrial user must also be in compliance with section 21751 regarding the prohibition of bypass 6 the control authority may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the control authority 7 once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 8 many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation 9 any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the control authority within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the control authority of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate g state pretreatment standards users must comply with state pretreatment standards codified at lac 33  ix subpart 2 h local limits the control authority is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 cfr 4035c local limits the city has established local limits in accordance with the federal pretreatment regulations the limits as listed in the tables below are either maximum industrial user headworks loading in lbsday or maximum daily industrial user concentrations in milligrams per liter to each respective treatment plant no industrial user will be allowed to discharge those pollutants limited by concentration milligrams per liter at daily maximum concentrations greater than values tabulated herein the local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the potw all concentrations for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise the control authority may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentrationbased limitations below table 10 technically based local limits for plant a the following pollutant limits are established

improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph 3 below are met 3 a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and c the user has submitted the following information to the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days 1 a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  2 the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and 3 steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance 4 in any enforcement proceeding the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof 5 users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards 6 users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails b prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in the specific prohibitions in section 2175 a d of this ordinance if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause passinterference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the passinterference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 for the purposes of this section a bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this subsection 3 bypass notifications a if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the control authority at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible b a user shall submit oral notice to the control authority of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the control authority may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received with 24 hours 4 bypass a bypass is prohibited and the control authority may take enforcement action against a user of a bypass unless 1 the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage 2 there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and 3 the user submitted notices as required under paragraph 3 of this section b the control authority may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the control authority determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph 4a of this subsection  1301   8410   best management practices there exist small volumequantity discharges that

compliance with the requirements of the the city of lake charles this enforcement response plan is implemented by the city of lake charles 1 notice of violation a a notice of violation nov will be issued as a response to all violations of the article wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement except where the violation is recurring  then an appropriate administrative order civil action andor criminal action may be taken the nov will list each violation of the permit andor violation of the article individually and give a brief description of facts surrounding each violation the nov shall be served upon the industrial user personally or by registered or certified mail return receipt requested and the nov shall give a specific date deadline in order to bring the iu into compliance within ten days of the receipt of this notice an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof to include specific required actions shall be submitted by the user to the control authority b submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the control authority to take any action including emergency actions or any other enforcement action without first issuing a notice of violation 2 administrative orders other enforcement responses fall under the title of administrative orders ao administrative orders for the city of lake charless control authoritys use are enforcement documents that direct industrial users to undertake or to cease specified activities the control authority may use aos to negotiate with industrial users also the control authority may use aos as a second formal response to a significant noncompliance unless judicial proceedings are deemed necessary and may incorporate schedules and termination of service orders for our specific purposes we will use the following administrative orders a showcause hearing 1 a showcause hearing order will direct the iu to appear before the superintendent explain its noncompliance and show why more stringent enforcement actions against the user should not be instituted this order will be used after the user has been served with a notice of violation continues to violate any provision of this article a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement and failed to correct the noncompliance this order or hearing may also be used to investigate violations of previous orders the showcause hearing will be conducted before the citys attorney the director of public works the superintendent of the wastewater division and the pretreatment coordinator 2 notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting the proposed enforcement action the reasons for such action

against or prerequisite for taking any other action against the user b compliance orders 1 the control authority will use compliance orders which will direct the iu to achieve compliance by a date specified in the order such order will be issued when noncompliance cannot be resolved without construction repair or process changes and for developing sufficient management plans spill prevention programs or related pretreatment program requirements each order will list the proposed compliance plan giving reasonable milestone dates for each major step and dates for any necessary reporting the control authority will closely document and follow up all milestone dates prior to said deadlines 2 the compliance order may also be employed when the control authority finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement the control authority may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time 3 if the user does not come into compliance within the time provided sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated the superintendent may also seek any and all remedies available including civil andor criminal penalties compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance including additional selfmonitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer a compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation including any continuing violation issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user c cease and desist orders 1 the cease and desist order will direct the noncomplying user to cease illegal or authorized discharges immediately or to terminate its discharge altogether in situations where a discharge may cause interference or passsome other emergency situation this order may be used  or 2 when the control authority finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this article a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement or that the users past violations are likely to recur the control authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to i immediately comply with all requirements  and ii take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation including halting operations andor terminating the discharge this order may be issued immediately upon discovery of the problem or following a hearing should the iu fail to comply with this order the control authority may halt the discharge by terminating service or blocking the users connection point andor take judicial action issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user 3 administrative fines a when

requirement the superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $100000 such fines shall be assessed on a per violation per day basis in the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation b unpaid charges fines and penalties shall after 30 calendar days of timeframe specified on the administrative fine be assessed an additional penalty of one percent of the unpaid balance and interest shall accrue an additional rate of one percent for each month the fine is not paid the unpaid charges fines and penalties shall not exceed more than 90 days of the timeframe specified on the administrative fine if the user should exceed 90 days a lien against the users property will be sought for unpaid charges

presents or may present an endangerment to the environment b any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution in the event of a users failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order the control authority may take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the potw its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals the control authority may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the control authority that the period of endangerment has passed unless the termination proceedings in section 21765 of this article are initiated against the user c a user that is responsible in whole or in part for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the control authority prior to the date of any showcause or termination hearing under sections 21762a or 5 of this article d nothing in this section shall be interpreted as

inspection monitoring or sampling  or e violation of the pretreatment standards in section 2175 of this article such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under section 21762a of this article why the proposed action should not be taken exercise of this option by the control authority shall not be a bar to or a prerequisite for taking any other action against the user  82191   10406   8410   judicial enforcement remedies a injunctive relief when the control authority finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this ordinance a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement the control authority may petition the city court of lake charles louisiana citys attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction as appropriate which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit order or other requirement imposed by this ordinance on activities of the user the control authority may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal andor equitable relief including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation a petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action against a user b civil penalties another avenue of the enforcement response plan is the use of civil action which will be used to secure courtordered action to correct violations and to secure penalties for violations including the recovery of costs to the potw of the noncompliance the proceeding to recover any civil penalty shall be commenced by petition of the control authority calling upon the city attorney to maintain an action for injunction to cause correction of any such violation and for assessment and recovery of the civil penalty civil litigation for the control authoritys purpose will be pursued when corrective action is costly and complex or when the iu is considered to be unwilling to cooperate 1 every user who has violated or who shall continue any violation of any provision of this ordinance a wastewater discharge

sso where sewer water flows out of a manhole cover and along the ground these overflows can contaminate the ground local water bodies and any property that the sewerage contacts the improper management of fog is not only a hazard to the environment and potentially the publics health it also results in added financial burdens to both business establishments and wastewater treatment plants

areas differing by allowing home occupations planting is naturalistic with setbacks relatively deep blocks may be large and the roads irregular to accommodate natural conditions t4 the general urban zone consists of a mixeduse but primarily residential urban fabric it has a wide range of building types single sideyard and rowhouses setbacks and landscaping are variable streets typically define mediumsized blocks t5 the urban center zone consists of higher density mixeduse building types that accommodate retail offices rowhouses and apartments it has a tight network of streets with wide sidewalks steady street tree planting and buildings set close to the frontages t6 the urban core zone consists of the highest density with the greatest variety of uses and civic buildings of regional importance it may have larger blocks  streets have steady street tree planting and buildings set close to the frontages table 2 building types this table approximates the location of the structure relative to the boundaries of each individual lot establishing suitable building types for each transect zone a edgeyard specific types  single family house cottage villa estate house urban villa a building that occupies the center of its lot with setbacks on all sides this is the least urban of types as the front yard sets it back from the frontage while the side yards weaken the spatial definition of the public thoroughfare space the front yard is intended to be visually continuous with the yards of adjacent buildings the rear yard can be secured for privacy by fences and a wellplaced backbuilding andor outbuilding b sideyard specific types  charleston single house zerolotline house a building that occupies one side of the lot with the setback to the other side the visual opening of the side yard on the street frontage causes this building type to appear freestanding a shallow frontage setback defines a more urban condition if the adjacent building is similar with a blank party wall the yard can be quite private this type permits systematic climatic orientation in response to the sun or the breeze c rearyard specific types  townhouse rowhouse livework unit perimeter block a building that occupies the full frontage leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard this is a very urban type as the continuous facade steadily defines the public thoroughfare the rear elevations may be articulated for functional purposes in its residential form this type is the rowhouse for its commercial form the rear yard can accommodate substantial parking d courtyard specific types  patio house a building that occupies the boundaries of its lot while internally defining one or more private patios this is the most urban of types as it is able to shield the private realm from all sides while strongly defining the public thoroughfare because of its ability to accommodate incompatible activities masking them from all sides it is recommended for workshops lodging and schools the high security provided by the continuous enclosure is useful for crimeprone areas e specialized a building that is not subject to categorization buildings dedicated to manufacturing and transportation are often distorted by the trajectories of machinery civic buildings which may express the aspirations of institutions may be included table 3 building configuration this table shows prescribed building heights for each transect zone the vertical extent of a building is measured by number of stories not including a raised basement or an inhabited attic heights are measured from the average grade of the frontage line to the eave of a pitched roof or to the surface of a flat roof the term tower here refers to an attached or detached addition to a building not to an entire building note n stands for any stories above those shown up to the maximum refer to metrics for exact minimums and maximums table 4 private frontages the private frontage is the area between the building and the lot lines a common yard a frontage wherein the facade is set back substantially from the frontage line the front yard created remains unfenced and is visually continuous with adjacent yards supporting a common landscape the deep setback provides a buffer from the higher speed thoroughfares b porch and fence a frontage wherein the facade is set back from the frontage line with an attached porch permitted to encroach a fence at the frontage line maintains the demarcation of the yard the porches shall be no less than 8 feet deep c terrace or light court a frontage wherein the facade is set back from the frontage line by an elevated terrace or a sunken light court this type buffers residential use from urban sidewalks and removes the private yard from public encroachment the terrace is suitable for conversion to outdoor cafes d forecourt a frontage wherein a portion of the facade is close to the frontage line and the central portion is set back the forecourt created is suitable for vehicular dropoffs this type should be allocated in conjunction with other frontage types large trees within the forecourts may overhang the sidewalks e stoop a frontage wherein the facade is aligned close to the frontage line with the first story elevated from the sidewalk sufficiently to secure privacy for the windows the entrance is usually an exterior stair and landing this type is recommended for groundfloor residential use f shopfront and awning a frontage wherein the facade is aligned close to the frontage line with the building entrance at sidewalk grade this type is conventional for retail use it has a substantial glazing on the sidewalk level and an awning that may overlap the sidewalk to the maximum extent possible g gallery a frontage wherein the facade is aligned close to the frontage line with an attached cantilevered shed or a lightweight colonnade overlapping the sidewalk this type is conventional for retail use the gallery shall be no less than 10
