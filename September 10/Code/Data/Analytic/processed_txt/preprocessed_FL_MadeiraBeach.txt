vegetated buffers swales vegetated watercourses wetlands underground drains catch basins ponds porous pavements and similar systems for the detention retention treatment and percolation of runoff should be used as appropriate to increase time of concentration decrease velocity increase infiltration allow suspended solids to settle and remove pollutants 4 the first one inch of runoff from impervious surfaces should be retained on the site of development 5 runoff from parking lots should be treated to remove oil and sediment before it enters receiving waters 6 erosion should be minimized and sediment should be retained on the site of development 7 the area of land disturbed by development should be the minimum feasible those areas which are not to be disturbed should be protected from construction activity by an adequate barrier wherever possible natural vegetation shall be retained and protected 8 natural watercourses should not be filled dredged cleared deepened widened straightened stabilized or otherwise altered 9 intermittent watercourses such as swales must be vegetated 10 artificial watercourses should be designed considering the soil type so the velocity of flow is low enough to prevent erosion 11 detention and retention areas should be designed so shorelines are sinuous rather than straight and so the length of shoreline is maximized thus offering more space for the growth of littoral shoreline vegetation 12 the banks of detention and retention areas should slope at a gentle grade into the water as a safeguard against personal injury to encourage the growth of littoral vegetation and to allow the alternate flooding and exposure of areas along the shore 13 wetlands should not be altered relocated damaged or used as detention ponds

allow for periodic flooding without damage to buildings roads or other structures 16 erosion and sedimentation control devices should be installed between the disturbed area and water bodies watercourses and wetlands before grading cutting or filling is begun 17 land which has been cleared for development and upon which construction has commenced should be protected from erosion by appropriate techniques designed to stabilize soil and revegetate the area adequate protective measures include hay bales baffles sodding and sandbagging 18 wetlands and other natural water bodies

of standards for the structural design fabrication and erection use maintenance and alteration of signs symbols markings or advertising devices within the city the standards of this chapter are designed to protect and promote the health safety and welfare of persons within the city by providing regulations which allow and encourage creativity effectiveness and flexibility in the design and use of such devices while promoting traffic safety and avoiding an environment that encourages visual blight the sign regulations in this section are not intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints but instead are intended to regulate the secondary effects of speech and especially insofar as those secondary effects may adversely affect aesthetics and traffic and pedestrian safety and to accomplish the following encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communications in the city 1 maintain and enhance the visual and aesthetic environment and thereby the citys ability to attract sources of economic development and growth including enhancing the tourism industry  2 foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs  3 preserve conserve protect and enhance the aesthetic quality historic resources and scenic beauty of the city  4 lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation improper placement illumination animation excessive height and excessive size area of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic  5 minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property  6 regulate the appearance and design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances the beautification of the city and that compliments the natural surroundings in recognition of this citys reliance on its natural surroundings and beautification efforts in retaining economic advantage for its resort community as well as for its major office and industrial parks gateways downtown and waterfront areas and overlay districts  7 allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs  8 improve pedestrian and traffic safety  9 regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with obstruct the vision of or distract motorists bicyclists or pedestrians  10 except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law ensure that signs are constructed installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner and protect the public from unsafe signs  11 encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the land use atlas district in which they are located and consistent with the category of use and function to which they pertain  12 curtail the size and number of signs to the minimum reasonably necessary to identify a residential or business location and the nature of any such business  13 establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains  14 preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site and adjoining signs  15 allow for traffic control devices consistent with national standards and whose purpose is to promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and highways and that notify road users of regulations and provide warning and guidance needed for the safe uniform and efficient operation of all elements of the traffic stream  16 protect property values by precluding to the maximum extent possible sign types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size height illumination brightness or movement  17 protect property values by ensuring that sign types as well as the number of signs are in harmony with buildings neighborhoods and conforming signs in the area

permit lawful nonconforming uses and structures created by the adoption of this continue until removed by economic or other forces this article is intended to discourage the continuation of nonconformities as they are incompatible with the provisions of the city comprehensive plan and this b all rights and obligations associated with a nonconforming status run with the property are not personal to the present ownership or tenant and are not effected by a change of ownership or tenancy unless abandoned a classification a nonconformities are classified as follows 1 2 uses of land and

any nonconforming use permanent structure or both b no such nonconforming use shall be relocated or moved to any portion of the lot other than that occupied at the time that the nonconforming status was created c when a nonconforming use is changed modified or diversified to meet requirements of a conforming use the building or structure in which the use is located shall conform to the development standards and regulations as set forth in this if any nonconforming use or any portion thereof ceases for any reason for more than one year 365 days the grandfather status of the

the area be obstructed by landscaping that prevents access acrossclear area although the area may be fenced as long as it is accessible by way of a gate additionally the property that is the subject of reduced setbacks must be improved with drainage systems including but not limited to roof gutter systems adequate to carry all runoff and direct it away from the neighboring property in a manner that ensures no impact upon the neighboring property the required clearance area is not a reduction of setback but a minimum clear path of access between the front and rear yard furthermore extensions
