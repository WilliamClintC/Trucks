richard phd and meeker james w phd final report to the city of garden grove the relationship between crime and adult business operations on garden grove boulevard garden grove california   this legislative body finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities 2 sexual acts including masturbation oral sex and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexually oriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3 offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions 4 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities 5 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films concealed from public view 6 the findings noted in subsections c1 of this section raise compelling and substantial governmental concerns 7 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those compelling and substantial governmental concerns 8 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the municipality it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9 the regulation of nudity seminudity and physical contact between employees and patrons in sexually oriented businesses will further the compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sex related crimes including illegal sex acts and protecting the public health safety and welfare 10 requiring open sightlines in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the compelling and substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 11 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12 a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business 13 barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 332 definitions for purposes of this chapter employee a natural person who performs any service or work on the premises of a sexually oriented business

corps of engineers waterways experiment station vicksburg mississippi 391 for a copy of the booklet streambank protection guidelinesfor landowners and local governments or a registered professional engineer b general guidelines for riprap placement the following suggestions are listed as general guidance for the placement of riprap the most common form of bank protection 1 a well distributed mix of stones weighing from ten 10 to twenty 20 pounds per stone or larger should be used 2 the thickness of the riprap layer should be from ten 10 to eighteen 18 inches portions of the riprap layer that would normally be underwater should be increased to twelve 12 to eighteen 18 inches 3 below the riprap layer there shall be a six inch 6 layer of filter medium such as sand or washed gravel and a layer of filter fabric 4 dumped riprap should be placed at a slope of two 2 horizontal to one vertical or flatter the slope may be increased to 15 horizontal to one vertical for hand placed riprap 5 a riprap trench or apron should be provided at the base of the protected bank for stability 6 both ends of the project should be tied into the bank  the most common method being to excavate a trench in the bank and fill it with riprap c privately owned sand beaches a sand beach will only be allowed in areas behind shoreline protection beach must be constructed in such a way that at no time will sand be introduced into the lake existing sand beach areas are not allowed to bring in any new sand anyone doing so will be subject to fines in the amount set forth in the annual fee ordinance contained in

established prior to the effective date of this code that do not conform to the regulations of this code applicable in the zoning districts in which such uses structures lots and signs are located the zoning districts established by this code are designed to guide the future use of land within the village by encouraging the development or maintenance of desirable residential business and office areas with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health safety and general welfare the continued existence of nonconformities is frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such districts are established and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is generally desirable b general scope and scheme of regulation separate restrictions are established for nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses of structures designed for a permitted use 9102 nonconforming uses of structures not designed for a permitted use 9103 nonconforming structures 9104 nonconforming lots of record 9105 and nonconforming signs 9106 the degree of restriction made applicable to each category of nonconformity is generally related to the degree of incompatibility with permitted uses and the amount of investment typically associated with nonconformities of that type pursuant to section 91115 of this code provision is made for relief from some of the restrictions of this chapter 10 when practical difficulties exist in the cases of nonconforming uses of land nonconforming uses in structures designed for a permitted use and nonconforming signs the degree of incompatibility is frequently great the investment is comparatively small and the economic life is short in these cases elimination of the nonconformity is required after a relatively short but reasonable amortization period in the case of nonconforming uses in structures not designed for any conforming use the degree of incompatibility is also frequently great but so too is the investment and economic life of the structure in such cases while eventual elimination is required a more extended period is allowed in which to amortize the investment while the regulations of this chapter 10 related to all other nonconformities allow such nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time they restrict further investments that would make more permanent their location in inappropriate districts c exception for repairs pursuant to public order nothing in this chapter 10 shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition provided such restoration is not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of this chapter 10 prohibiting the repair or restoration of partially damaged or destroyed structures or signs d nonconforming accessory uses and structures no use structure or sign that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such principal use or structure shall have been terminated unless it shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located 9102 nonconforming uses of land and nonconforming uses in structures designed for a permitted use a authority to continue except as provided in subsection i of this section any lawfully existing nonconforming use not involving the use of a structure or involving only a structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or located in a structure designed for a use permitted in the district in which it is located may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the regulations contained in subsections b of this section and in subsection d of section 9101 of this code b ordinary repair and maintenance normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls nonbearing partitions fixtures wiring or plumbing may be performed on any structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use but devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use  provided however that this subsection shall not be deemed to authorize any violation of subsections c of this section c structural alteration no structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located no such alteration shall create a new parking bulk yard or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing parking bulk yard or space nonconformity of such structure in determining whether a parking nonconformity has been created or increased the provisions of section 994 of this code shall control d enlargement of structure no structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or that is designed for a permitted use and devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner including the interior addition of floor area unless the use of such structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is located no such enlargement shall create any new parking bulk yard or space nonconformity or increase the degree of any existing parking bulk yard or space nonconformity of such structure in determining whether a parking nonconformity has been created or increased the provisions of section 994 of this code shall control e extension of use a nonconforming use of land or of a structure that is accessory to a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use in a structure designed for a permitted use shall not be extended expanded enlarged or increased in intensity such prohibited activity shall include without being limited to 1 an extension of such use including its accessory uses to any structure or land area other than that occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of this code or any amendment hereto that causes such use to become nonconforming  and 2 an extension of such use

irregular or substandard shape or size  exceptional topographical features  or other extraordinary physical conditions peculiar to and inherent in the subject property that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the owner and that relate to or arise out of the lot rather than the personal situation of the current owner of the lot b not selfcreated the aforesaid unique physical condition is not the result of any action or inaction of the owner or his predecessors in title and existed at the time of the enactment of the provisions from which a variation is sought or was created by natural forces or was the result of governmental action other than the adoption of this title for which no compensation was paid c denied substantial rights the carrying out of the strict letter of the provision from which a variation is sought would deprive the owner of the subject property of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by owners of other lots subject to the same provision d not merely special privilege the alleged hardship or difficulty is not merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some special privilege or additional right not available to owners or occupants of other lots subject to the same provision not merely an inability to make more money from the sale of the subject property e plan purposes the variation would not result in a use or development of the subject property that would not be in harmony with the general and specific purposes of which this title and the provisions from which a variation is sought were enacted or the general purposes and intent of the official comprehensive plan f essential character of the area the variation would not result in a use or development on the subject property that i would be materially detrimental to the

would unduly tax public utilities and facilities in the area  or vi would endanger the public health or safety g no other remedy there is no other means other than the requested variation by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided or remedied to a degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the subject property g variation less than requested a variation less than or different

may be useful in protecting the character of substantially developed and stable areas may impose inappropriate preregulations and rigidities upon the development or redevelopment of lots or areas that lend themselves to an individual planned approach through the flexibility of the planned unit development technique the village seeks to achieve the following specific objectives 1 provide for the permanent preservation of more common open spaces and better recreational opportunities or facilities than are required of developments under the strict interpretation of this title 2 to enable the development to better preserve natural vegetation and topographic and geological features than would otherwise be required of developments under the strict interpretation of this title 3 to encourage developers to invest in amenities that enhance the quality of design and community character provision of better public facilities 4 to permit developers of commercial properties the flexibility to design their projects to provide the maximum flexibility of design to meet the varying conditions imposed by existing residential or nonresidential uses 5 to permit developers to establish a quality
