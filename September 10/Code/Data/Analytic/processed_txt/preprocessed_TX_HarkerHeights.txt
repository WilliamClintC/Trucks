water requirements by adopting conservation measures that will prevent the otherwise expected rise in per capita use of water and endeavor to maintain the current level of per capita demand this goal recognizes that there are factors that will increase the average per capita use of water unless additional conservation actions are taken these factors that may increase the per capita use are projected increases in per capita income increases in the employment population ratio increases in the proportion of singlefamily homes increases in the number of persons living in each household and uses by additional industries as the economy of the community expands bgiven these potentials for causing the per capita use to increase and the fact that the city council has already adopted and implemented all of those conservation measures which are considered to have a large impact on water use a goal of further reducing the per capita demand would be unrealistic for water resources

life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage passed 92308

of this subchapter to control soil erosion and sedimentation resulting from development activities covering one or more acre s while measures must be taken to control and guarantee that post development stormwater runoff from any development must not exceed that of pre development additional measures must be taken to control erosion and sedimentation ensuring that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of 10year frequency or less bthe following principles shall apply to all development activities covered by this subchapter and to the preparation of the submissions required under  15616 1 preserving and protecting the natural topography site development should be planned so that it is consistent with and conforms to the topography and soils of the site so as to minimize and prevent soil erosion 2protection of adjacent properties properties adjacent to the site of a landdisturbing activity shall be protected from sedimentation by preserving a permanent vegetation buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the activity or by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers filters straw bail dikes or sediment basins or by a combination of such measures vegetative buffer strips should be at least 10 feet in width and may be used alone only where runoff in sheet flow is expected according to the erosion and sedimentation control plan if at any time it is determined by the agent that a vegetated buffer strip alone is ineffective in preventing sediment movement on to adjacent property additional perimeter controls must be provided 3cut and fill slope development shall reflect the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided whenever possible and natural contours shall be followed as closely as possible in the design of cut and fill slopes consideration must be given to the length and steepness of the slope the soil type upslope drainage area groundwater conditions and other applicable factors depending on the circumstances acceptable design options may include athe use of permanent vegetation alone with special anchoring such as netting to hold mulch on newly seeded areas when seeding and mulching special care must be given to ensure land is properly fertilized seeded mulched anchored and watered newly seeded areas shall be watered gently and regularly as necessary to keep the soil sufficiently moist grass shall be watered as needed until grass is at least two inches tall bthe use of special structural materials such as riprap gabions revetments retaining walls or other methods sufficient to prevent excessive erosion 4vegetation natural vegetation shall be retained and protected whenever possible if vegetation is the developers choice a permanent vegetative cover shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized permanent vegetation and related structures shall be installed as soon as practical or within the time specified in the site preparation permit permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a ground cover is achieved which in the opinion of the agent is mature enough to control soil erosion satisfactorily and to survive severe weather conditions 5 channel stability in both natural and manmade waterways a texasregistered engineer must design new ditches for adequate stability and capacity in addition if existing natural drainage channels will be used to convey increased volumes of stormwater from a site the engineer may need to provide reinforcement measures all erosion control plans will detail how to protect the ditches andor natural drainage from excessive erosion and sedimentation 6timing and stabilization of sediment trapping measures sediment basins and traps perimeter dikes sediment barriers and other measures intended to trap sediment onsite must be constructed as a first step in grading and must be made functional before upslope landdisturbing activity takes place soil stabilization of earthen structures such as dams dikes and diversions must occur within 15 days of installation of the structure 7stabilization of waterways and outlets all onsite stormwater conveyance channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a 10year frequency storm without erosion stabilization adequate to prevent erosion must also be provided at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels 8construction on slopes or adjacent to water bodies or courses for channel or slope construction on slopes greater than  backup protection for the primary erosion control measure should be provided any new development adjacent to an existing ditch should have a minimum of 15foot drainage access casements on each side of the ditch in addition no property owner may install a fence within 15 feet of a ditch stream brook or other natural drainage channel  except where a concrete flume or concrete channel is constructed the abutting property owner is allowed to construct a fence up to the edge of the concrete however the city reserves the right to remove the fence in order to access the drainage structure for needed maintenance 9stormwater management criteria for off site erosion provision shall be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development drainageways shall be designed so that the final gradients and the resultant velocities of discharges will not create
