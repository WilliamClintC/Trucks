official township of north huntingdon proposed ordinance no 28 of 2000 ordinance no 1028 an ordinance to require adult oriented businesses to obtain a license and to establish fees fines and penalties

enacted as follows purpose and findings a purpose the township of north huntingdon desires to promote the health safety and welfare of its citizens  pursuant to the authority of the first class township findings the board of commissioners of the township of north huntingdon find as follows l a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is appropriate to require reasonable 1 assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 2 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 3 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business will help limit and control the adverse secondary effects of such businesses 4 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 5 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 2 definitions a adult oriented business  means any adult arcade adult bookstore adult video store adult cabaret adult motel adult motion

stormwater management but include any techniques to minimize impervious surfaces andor increase the time of concentration for stormwater runoff flowing from the development site c multiply the subarea release rate percentage by the predevelopment rate of runoff from the development site to determine the maximum allowable release rate from any detention facility for the four prescribed storm events d if the postdevelopment peak runoff rate and volume are greater than the allowed release rate of the predevelopment peak runoff rate and volume then stormwater detention will be required and the capacity of the detention facility must be calculated in the manner prescribed in e design the outlet control facilities and size the volume of the detention facility using the calculated post development hydrograph and accepted hydrograph routing procedures in consideration of the maximum allowable release rate e no harm evaluation 1 an applicant may seek to exceed the otherwise applicable subarea release rate percentage by performing the no harm evaluation this evaluation requires an independent engineering analysis to demonstrate that other reasonable options exist to prevent the occurrence of increased stormwater runoff discharge rates andor velocities or that measures can be provided to prevent increased stormwater discharge rates andor velocities from increasing flood elevations and accelerating erosion at all downstream points in the watershed 2 a no harm evaluation will be considered only in instances where the discharge to a stream channel from the development

appendix b low impact development practices appendix b low impact development practices alternative approach for managing stormwa ter runoff natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned development practices such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces destroying existing drainage swales constructing unnecessary storm sewers and changing local topography a traditional drainage approach of development has been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location the recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will m1nrm1ze post development runoff rates and volumes which will minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities to simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces the ability of the ground to infiltrate depends upon the soil types and its conditions preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site design considerations site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features the following describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approach  preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants however this objective is often not accomplished in land development in fact commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration developments designed to fit site topography also minimizes the amount of grading on site  protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large runoff events traditional development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby obliterating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site the depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities  avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff  reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the development  routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street by routing roof drains and crowning the driveway to run off to the lawn the lawn is essentially used as a filter strip  reducing the use of storm sewers by reducing use of storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and back yards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating local citizens and public works officials who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event  reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking or by reducing roadway widths municipal planners and traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could lower maintenance  limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicyclerecreational trails that follow backoflot lines where appropriate backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials  using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads  reducing building setbacks reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem  constructing cluster developments cluster developments can also reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots the biggest savings is in street length which also will reduce costs of the development cluster development clusters the construction activity onto lesssensitive areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development in summary a careful consideration of the existing topography and implementation of a combination of the above mentioned techniques may avoid construction of costly stormwater control measures other benefits include reduced potential of downstream flooding water quality degradation of receiving streamswater bodies and enhancement of aesthetics and reduction of development costs beneficial results include more stable baseflows in receiving streams improved groundwater recharge reduced flood flows reduced pollutant loads and reduced costs for conveyance and storage appendix c nonstructural and structural bmps appendix c alternative runoff control techniques and their efficiency in the watershed various types of structural and nonstructural stormwater best management practices bmps that can be implemented on a site to meet the standards and criteria established for the township of north huntingdon are presented in this section the primary sources for a majority of the information regarding the bmps are marylands stormwater design manual volumes i and ii and pennsylvanias handbook of best management practices for developing areas padep recommends using the maryland stormwater design manual as a reference for stormwater management guidance the maryland stormwater design manual is available on the padep website at wwwdepstatepausdepdeputatewatermgmtwcsubjectsstormwatermanagementhtm pennsylvania is in the process of developing its own stormwater management manual that will be similar to marylands manual the pennsylvania manual should be used instead of the maryland manual when it is issued users of this ordinance should refer to these documents for additional information concerning bmps other sources of information regarding stormwater management and watershed planning are available from the maryland department of the environments nonpoint source program publications list 410 6313543 and the center for watershed protection wwwcwporg or 410 4618323 a site planning with nonstructural bmps from a stormwater management perspective the primary benefit provided by development site planning with nonstructural practices is that less stormwater runoff is generated thereby reducing the required size for structural stormwater management facilities and the cost to construct and maintain the facilities in addition to this most obvious benefit the use of nonstructural practices also serves to reduce the quantity of pollutants that are conveyed in stormwater runoff six types of nonstructural practices are presented for use in the towrship of north huntingdon for the purpose of promoting the use of nonstructural practices in the planning of development sites structural facility size reduction sfsr credits are included which may reduce the size of structural stormwater management facilities required to meet the standards and criteria established for the township of north huntingdon the nonstructural practices the criteria that must be met to be eligible for sfsr credits and the structural facility size calculation modifications that must be applied to realize the sfsr credits are described below natural area conservation by guaranteeing the permanent preservation and protection of natural areas from disturbance a developer can receive sfsr credits the natural area conservation sfsr credits are realized by applying the following modifications to the structural facility size calculations  the total natural land area that is conserved is subtracted from the total site area used to calculate the wov but the percent impervious cover i used to calculate the volumetric runoff coefficient rv is still calculated using the area of the entire site  in the calculations to determine the postdevelopment composite cn for the site all conserved natural areas can be assumed to be forest in good condition in order to guarantee the permanent preservation and protection of natural areas a conservation easement must be recorded for the preserved natural area a conservation easement incorporates legal provisions into a property deed that limits the use of the property conservation easements allow for the continued private ownership of the land but restrict land uses to current uses or to nondamaging activities natural areas include forests wetlands and associated buffers floodplains steep slopes natural drainage ways and depressions and meadows disconnection of rooftop runoff when developments are designed where rooftop runoff is allowed to discharge on to adjacent pervious area where the runoff can either infiltrate into the soil or is filtered by flowing overland sfsr credits are given typically rooftop runoff sfsr credits are obtained by grading the development site to promote overland filtering the rooftop runoff sfsr credits are realized by applying the following modifications to the structural facility size calculations  the disconnected rooftop area is deducted from the total impervious area when calculating the percent impervious cover 1 used to calculate the volumetric runoff coefficient rv ultimately the wov will be reduced  disconnected rooftops can be used to meet the runoff capture volume rs requirement by using the percent area method  in the calculations to determine the postdevelopment composite cn for the site all disconnected rooftop area can be assumed to be forest in good condition the following restrictions must be considered prior to applying the modifications used to realize the rooftop runoff sfsr credits  the maximum rooftop area contributing to any one down spout discharge shall be 500 square feet  the distance from a down spout discharge point to an impervious surface must be equal to or greater than 75 feet  where the 75foot distance is impossible to attain and if the development site is located outside of the area of dry wells french drains or similar infiltration facilities may be used to compensate for disconnection lengths less than 75 feet  the average slope of the overland flow area that receives the down spout discharge shall be no greater than five percent disconnection of impervious surface runoff sfsr credits are also given when developments are designed to allow impervious surfaces to discharge onto adjacent pervious areas where the runoff can either infiltrate into the soil or be filtered by flowing overland typically the impervious surface runoff sfsr credits are obtained by grading the development site to promote overland filtering the impervious surface runoff sfsr credits are realized by applying the following modifications to the structural facility size calculations  the disconnected impervious area is deducted from the total impervious area when calculating the percent impervious cover i used to calculate the volumetric runoff coefficient rv ultimately the wov will be reduced  disconnected impervious areas can be used to meet the runoff capture volume rs requirement by using the percent area method  in the calculations to determine the postdevelopment composite cn for the site all disconnected impervious area can be assumed to be forest in good condition the following restrictions must be considered prior to applying the modifications used to realize the impervious surface runoff sfsr credits  the maximum impervious area contributing to any one discharge point is 1000 square feet  the maximum flow length across an impervious area to a discharge point onto an adjacent pervious area is 75 feet  the distance from the discharge point of a disconnected impervious surface across a vegetated pervious area to another impervious area must be equal to or greater than the flow length across the contributing impervious area  the average slope across the vegetated pervious area shall not exceed 5 percent  disconnection areas are encouraged for relatively permeable soils b hydrologic soil group without soil testing  if the development site has less permeable soils c hydrologic soil group or the minimum pervious flow length can not be attained a spreading device such as a gravel trench is required to receive impervious surface runoff sfsr credits stream buffers vegetated riparian land adjacent to streams stabilizes the stream bank filters pollutants from stormwater runoff and provides habitat for a variety of amphibians aquatic birds and mammals that depend on their proximity to water for their life functions a riparian forested buffer should be preserved or created along the banks of streams wherever possible therefore a stream buffer sfsr credit will be given when the riparian forested buffer is preserved or created and stormwater runoff is discharged to the buffer flow a stream buffer sfsr credit is realized by applying the following modifications to the structural facility size calculations  the area draining by overland flow to a stream buffer is subtracted from the total site area in the wov calculation  the area draining by overland flow to a stream buffer can be used to meet the runoff capture volume rs requirement by using the percent area method  in the calculations to determine the postdevelopment composite cn for the site all area draining by overland flow to a stream buffer can be assumed to be forest in good condition the following restrictions must be considered prior to applying the modifications used to realize the stream buffer sfsr credit  the minimum width for the stream buffer is 50 feet  the maximum flow length of the area draining to the stream buffer is 150 feet for pervious area surfaces and 75 feet for impervious surfaces  the average slope of the area draining to the stream buffer shall not exceed five percent  stormwater runoff must enter the stream buffer as overland flow a level spreading facility shall be utilized wherever sheet flow cannot be maintained  if rooftop runoff sfsr credits or impervious surface runoff sfsr credits have been applied to the overland flow entering the stream buffer the stream buffer sfsr credit is no longer available  other than the removal of trash stream buffers shall not be managed grass channels grass channels filter pollutants as stormwater runoff moves along the open channel in addition grass channels reduce peak rates of runoff and increase opportunities for infiltration when designing a development site using open grass channels natural drainage ways on the site should be maintained and used as part of the open channel drainage system wherever possible because of the benefits provided by grass channels a grass channel sfsr credit will be given when open channels are used a grass channel sfsr credit is realized by applying the following modifications to the structural facility size calculations  the portion of a development site that is drained using open channels is subtracted from the total site area in the wov calculation  the area that is drained using open channels can be used to meet the runoff capture volume rs requirement by using the percent area method the following restrictions must be considered prior to applying the modifications used to realize the grass channel sfsr credit  the maximum flow velocity for runoff from the 160inch rainfall event shall be less than or equal to 10 fps  the minimum bottom width shall be 2 feet and the maximum bottom width shall be 6 feet  the side slopes shall be 3 horizontal to 1 vertical or flatter  the channel slope shall be equal to or less than 4 percent  if rooftop runoff sfsr credits or impervious surface runoff sfsr credits have been applied to the overland flow entering the open channel the open channel sfsr credit is no longer available environmentally sensitive development credit a development sfsr credit is given when specific criteria for environmentally sensitive site design are used in low density and rural residential development when the specific criteria are met the need to provide structural facilities to treat both the wovand the rs are eliminated for residential construction on a single lot the criteria are as follows  total impervious cover is less than 15 percent of the lot area   minimum lot size is 2 acres   all rooftop runoff is disconnected in accordance with the requirements for realizing rooftop runoff sfsr credits  and  grass channels are used to convey stormwater runoff in place of curb and gutters for a multiplelot residential subdivision the criteria are as follows  total impervious cover is less than 15 percent of the lot area   minimum lot size is 2 acres unless clustering techniques are used   all rooftop runoff is disconnected in accordance with the requirements for realizing rooftop runoff sfsr credits   grass channels are used to convey stormwater runoff in place of curb and gutters   at least 25 percent of the site is protected as natural conservation area a conservation easement must be recorded for the protected natural conservation area  and  structural stormwater facilities will still be required to manage stormwater runoff to meet requirements for the prevention of stream bank erosion and the control of over bank flooding and extreme flood events 8 structural bmps throughout pennsylvania the most common structural stormwater management facility that is seen at development sites is a dry detention basin dry detention basins are effective for providing the storage volume required for the following  the extended detention of stormwater runoff from the 1year 24hour storm event to prevent erosion of stream channels   to reduce the peak rate of runoff from the 10year 24hour storm event for postdevelopment conditions to the predevelopment peak rate of runoff thereby avoiding increases in the frequency of over bank flooding  and  to reduce the peak rate of runoff from the 100year 24hour storm event for postdevelopment conditions to the predevelopment peak rate of runoff thereby avoiding increases in the 100year floodplain area dry detention basins however do not effectively improve the quality of stormwater runoff and only allow for a small amount of stormwater runoff to infiltrate therefore at most development sites nonstructural controls in combination with more than one structural bmp and potentially a dry detention basin will be required to meet all stormwater management requirements in this section bmps that have been found to be effective in stormwater quality control andor the infiltration of stormwater runoff are presented these bmps have been separated into five general categories stormwater ponds stormwater wetlands infiltration practices filtering practices and swales stormwater ponds unlike dry stormwater detention basins

facilities follow  surface sand filter  a surface sand filter consists of a pretreatment sedimentation cell and sand filter bed the pretreatment sedimentation cell is used to remove larger particulates that would tend to prematurely clog the sand filter bed typically the sand filter bed would consist of 3 inches of topsoil planted with grass 18 inches of sand and a perforated pipe in gravel underdrain  underground sand filter  where land area is limited a sand filter can be constructed in an underground concrete box in advance of the sand filter bed stormwater conveyed by a pipe would flow wet pool chamber for the retention of debris and large particulates the sand filter bed would consist of a gravel layer 24 inches of sand and a perforated pipe in gravel underdrain  perimeter sand filter  also used where land area is limited a perimeter sand filter can be constructed in an underground concrete box located where it could receive sheet flow from an impervious area sheet flow would enter the filters sedimentation chamber at grade inlet grates the stormwater would then flow over a partition on to the sand filter that would consist of a gravel layer 18 inches of sand and a perforated pipe in gravel underdrain  bioretention  bioretention facilities represent a unique combination of open space with stormwater treatment and some stormwater infiltration a typical bioretention facility will have native plants in 4 feet of planting soil wth an optional sand filter layer and a perforated pipe in gravel underdrain excess stormwater can be allowed to overflow the facility basins that are connected to a storm drain system stormwater swale systems a swale is defined as a low tract of land  especially moist or marshy ground stormwater swale systems are designed to capture and treat the full wov they are formed by constructing check dams brief descriptions of two types of stormwater swale systems follow  dry swale  typically used to receive stormwater runoff from low density residential development sites or small impervious areas dry swales have a pretreatment forebay separated from a treatment cell by a check dam the treatment cell has 30 inches of sand
