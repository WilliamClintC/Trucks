matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers this supplement brings the to

city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example can be added between 204 and section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 statutory references the statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality as the statutes are revised these references will be updated crossreference table when a code is based on an earlier codification the crossreference table will help users find older or prior code references in the new code the crossreference table is located near the end of the code under the tabbed divider tables this table lists the prior code section in the column labeled prior  and the new code section in the column labeled herein as of supplement no 7 this table will no longer be updated disposition table to find a

from the code usually at the direction of the municipality the disposition will be not codified other dispositions sometimes used are tabled pending number not used or missing index if you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code start with the index this is an alphabetical multitier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference and crossreferences where necessary look for the main heading of the subject you need then the appropriate subheadings business license see also business tax fee  required when  the index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended instruction sheet each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an instruction sheet the instruction sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement it will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current removed pages should be kept for future reference page numbers when originally published the pages of this code were consecutively numbered as of

ordinance providing a formula for maximum annual rent increases and providing a procedure for hardship exceptions the provisions of which were set forth in former of this code the findings and purpose set forth in referred to the following conditions a there is presently within the city a shortage of spaces for the location of existing mobilehomes and recreational vehicles because of this shortage there is a very low vacancy rate b within the city there are a number of persons who reside permanently in units which today meet the legal definitions of recreational vehicles often these persons subsist on low fixed incomes and are unable to afford standard housing c because of the high cost and impracticability of moving mobilehomes the potential for damage resulting therefrom the requirements relating to the installation of mobilehomes including permits building requirements landscaping and site preparation the lack of alternative home sites for mobilehome residents and the substantial investment of mobilehome owners in such homes it is necessary to protect the owners of mobilehomes from unreasonable rent increases while at the same time recognizing the need of park owners to receive a suitable profit on their property with rental income sufficient to cover increases in the costs of repair insurance maintenance utilities employee services additional amenities and other costs of operation and to receive a fair return on their property d however it is recognized that a rent stabilization ordinance must be fair and equitable for all parties and must provide appropriate incentives for mobilehome park operators to continue their parks profitably and to upgrade and improve mobilehome parks as well as to attract additional investors for new parks in april of 200 the city council established a mobilehome rent stabilization subcommittee to review and consider amendments to the ordinance the subcommittee consisted of ten members five park owners and five tenants the subcommittee held fifteen meetings to consider changes to the ordinance and received public comment at the end of the meetings the subcommittee unanimously approved the recommended changes to the ordinance and submitted them to the city council the city council hereby finds that the conditions stated in subsections a of this section still exist  therefore the purpose of the city council in enacting these provisions is to prevent an exploitation of the shortage in vacant mobilehome spaces in the city to preserve affordable housing as prescribed by the citys general planhousing element to provide mobilehome park owners a guaranteed rate of annual space rent increase that more accurately reflects the rate of inflation given their usual expenses and to establish an improved process

      intent and findings a the intent of this chapter is to regulate the addition of new water users to the citys water system whether new construction expansions or new occupancies to ensure that demand for water shall not exceed available supply and that the pace of allocating the available water supply to new users is reasonable and orderly b the city presently has a limited amount of water resources  this fact is not only recognized by the city but also by the state of california in various actions of the california coastal commission limiting new development within the city limits new water users must be regulated accordingly to ensure that demand does not exceed supply and that the pace of development using available water is orderly and reasonable c the regulations established by this chapter may effectively limit the number of housing units which may be constructed on an annual basis but such limitation is necessary to protect the public health safety and welfare if water use exceeded supply and adequate water were not available to users then there could result in increased fire hazard adverse impacts on commerce industry and recreation and the public health safety and welfare would generally be jeopardized d by development that occurs in an orderly fashion is meant development which can be served by public utilities including but not limited to water resources and delivery systems which encourages infill in existing developed parts of the city rather than in large undeveloped areas along the perimeter of the community and which helps to implement the policies

allocation a during any fiscal year in which the city council determines not to award all of the water equivalency units allocations permitted by the city council may by resolution authorize building permits to be issued for new uses within the limits established in to those projects which because they have preexisting water equivalency units onsite have no necessity for new water equivalency units allocation from the city b proposals for residential projects which are being converted from former nonresidential uses or for residential redevelopment projects which increase the number of residential units on the property may be eligible to be considered for a special building allocation when those projects 1 have sufficient preexisting water equivalency units onsite due to prior water use on that property 2 are consistent with the annual building allocation established by the council as required by  will not require more water equivalency units for the current use to be converted than the amount set forth in the water equivalency table adopted by council resolution as referred to in c upon receipt of a redevelopment application and verification by the planning director that the proposal conforms to the above requirements and all other requirements of this code the application will be processed in the normal manner required for any necessary discretionary approvals the director on a quarterly basis shall provide the city council a list of all redevelopment projects having obtained all necessary discretionary approvals during that quarter the council may authorize the director to issue building permits to such projects in accordance with the limitations of the special building allocation for that calendar year during each quarterly authorization those projects highest on the longterm waiting list shall have priority over other applicants for access to the available special allocation permits except as set forth in subsection d of this section d in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this code and as subsequently amended projects which qualify as low and very lowincome housing developments shall be given priority to special building allocation permits over other applications e special building allocations will have not be allowed to carryovers water equivalency units from one calendar year to the next  therefore in the event a project requires more water equivalency units than the number of remaining water equivalency units available allocation the project proponent may reduce the number of units proposed which require water equivalency units or the next project in line that can be satisfied shall receive the award f any applicants applying to participate in a special building allocation but who i fails to meet the criteria above ii fails to obtain any required approvals or iii meets the criteria but withdraw the request shall be returned to that applicants original relative position on the longterm building allocation list  61416   reserved   nontransferability of water equivalency units a a water equivalency unit shall be awarded only to a specific project in a specific location minor amendments to

awarded to a project by the planning commission then that award shall remain in force for the period in which all applicable related discretionary and ministerial and administrative approvals are valid b any extensions granted to such permits prior to their expiration shall automatically extend the water equivalency units award to the new expiration date expiration of a projects conditional use permit or coastal development permit or other ministerial or administrative approval shall result in the expiration of water equivalency units awarded the project allocation of water equivalency units expiring in this manner cannot be reinstated in such cases new water allocations must be obtained for new or reactivated projects on a property c for existing commercial uses industrial uses and other nonresidential uses retrofit of onsite facilities may be credited on that property for potential further expansions or new nonresidential uses pursuant to the following standards 1 the water equivalency units earned by the retrofit must be maintained onsite and cannot be transferred to another property  and 2 the water equivalency units earned are all from onsite retrofit of that property pursuant to a retrofit program approved by the director consistent with these regulations and shall be valid for five years from the date of the retrofit  and 3 this retrofit need not be tied to any specific current projects but may apply to any future nonresidential expansions andor more intensive nonresidential use onsite  and 4 in the event of the contemplated sale of the subject property the retrofit application and replacement work shall be initiated and completed prior to the time of sale  sale defined as last condition precedent to the sale being satisfied  and 5 the retrofit water equivalency units earned can be transferred to a new owner but must remain with the same property see subsection c1  61416   limitations on allocations of water a the city shall not allocate any water

a nature of variances the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in  to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections c1 though c5 of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 7 upon consideration of the factors of b1 and the purposes of this title the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this title for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council will not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the san luis obispo county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency    mandatory construction and demolition debris recycling

to possible degradation by different human activities varies among habitat types uses acceptable in one type of habitat area may be unacceptable in a more sensitive one therefore environmentally sensitive habitat areas must be classified into one of the following types before determining permitted uses a wetlands lands which may be covered periodically or permanently with shallow water including saltwater marshes freshwater marshes open or closed brackish water marshes swamps mudflats and fens b estuary a coastal water body usually semienclosed by land but which has open partially obstructed or intermittent exchange with the ocean and in which ocean water is at least occasionally diluted by freshwater runoff from the land the salinity may be periodically increased above the open ocean by evaporation in general the boundary between wetland and estuary is the time of extreme low water  c sand dunes sandspit sand dunes are mounds of sand deposited by wind and frequently vegetated by characteristic plant species the sandspit is that geographic portion of the city surrounded on three sides by water and separating morro bay from the open ocean  much of the spit is covered by sand dunes  d stream corridors streams and adjacent riparian habitats a stream is a natural water course as designated on the most recently published united states geological survey map or any welldefined channel with distinguishable bed and bank that shows evidence of having contained flowing water as indicated by scour or deposit of rock sand gravel soil or debris a riparian habitat is an area characterized by an association of plant species which grow adjacent to freshwater watercourses including perennial and intermittent streams lakes and other bodies of fresh water  e restricted areas those habitats which have resources so environmentally sensitive that even passive recreational uses must be prohibited  f other all other environmentally sensitive habitat areas

excessive amount of signage both in terms of number and size as well as improper shape or design can be distracting to motorists and pedestrians and this condition adversely effects the public safety by creating a potential traffic hazard  b that excessive and poorly designed signs are confusing and reduce the effectiveness of all signs  this condition reduces the ability of residents and visitors to readily locate public facilities as well as businesses and services consequently this condition not only adversely affects public safety by interfering with safe travel but also affects the public welfare by reducing convenience to residents and visitors and the viability of commercial districts  c that signs provide important information to the public for a variety of purposes excessive and poorly designed signs interfere with the effective transmitting of this information to the detriment of the public welfare  d that excessive and poorly designed signs detract from the citys appearance and visual environment this fact is recognized both in the citys general plan as well as its certified local coastal program the visual environment is important to the property values and pleasant enjoyable quality of life for residents and therefore signs which degrade that environment adversely affect the public welfare furthermore the visual quality of the coastal zone which encompasses virtually the entire city is recognized in the california coastal act as a resource of statewide importance and therefore regulation of the size shape design and other features of signs which become part of the visual environment and which can detract from it if not carefully controlled is important for protecting this public resource also the visual quality of the city enhances its appeal to the tourists who contribute significantly to the local economy  therefore protection and enhancement of the visual environment is important to the vitality of the local economy  part 1995   definitions

in this appendix is from measure a approved by the voters in 198 and is provided for informational purposes purpose the purpose of this chapter is to prevent morro bay from becoming an oil port personnelboat center or other logistical base for offshore oil operation findings these findings are based on the city of morro bays general plan housing element eir for appropriate water rights in the morro and chorro basin may 1986  quarterly and annual water reports and other documents and information available and familiar to the city council and the people of morro bay a environment degradation 1 sensitive habitat areas the city is a small community with many unique and environmentally sensitive habitat areas these are critical wetlands habitats for several rare and endangered plant and animal species morro bay is a bird sanctuary established by the local audubon society 2 natural estuaries the estuary is among the last remaining natural estuaries along the coast of california and needs to be protected 3 physical settings the city is located in a physical setting with spectacular visual qualities the visual resources of the community serve as valuable assets to both city residents and visitors 4 environmental studies environmental studies designed to evaluate the potential impacts of oil and gas exploration and extraction activities on sensitive marine and coastal resources are not yet complete until these studies are completed it is impossible to weigh the risks of offshore oil development against the potential royalties or energy benefits 5 environmental impact reports of potential spills environmental impact reports prepared to assess the effects of offshore drilling actually predict large scale oil spills in addition to the destruction of marine life spills could reach the shoreline destroying habitat and reducing or eliminating seabird and other animal populations b effects on morro bay economy 1 commercial fishing significance the commercial fishing industry historically played a significant role in the development of morro bay and continues to provide an economic source for the community as well as serving as an important tourist attraction the california coastal act of 1976 requires morro bay to protect and where feasible upgrade commercial and recreational fishing facilities the city has a policy of giving priority to commercial fisheries in existing harbor facilities and in new harbor development 2 preservation morro bay is one of the last true fishing ports along the coast of california and as such should be preserved 3 commercial fishing needs there is a shortage of suitable wharfage space moorings and areas for expansion of the commercial fishing industry morro bay harbor cannot accommodate boats of the size generally associated with oil development service bases to do so would require a total redesign and redevelopment of the harbor and a tremendous amount of dredging lands available for additional wharfage are critical to the citys plans to develop facilities to meet the priority needs of the commercial fishing industry 4 conflict with oil support vessels due to the similarities in the requirements of commercial fishing boats and oil support vessels and because the oil industry can afford to pay more for the services required by their boats than the fishing industry commercial fishing would tend to be displaced 5 tourism tourism is an important part of the citys economy with the quality of the beaches and the beautiful visual resources being a prime factor in the success of the tourist industry oil and gas development anywhere off central california could have disastrous effect on beaches within the city and the tourist industry c impact of onshore facilities 1 support facilities support facilities for offshore oil and gas development cannot be accommodated in the city the citys local coastal program contains no sites designated onshore support facilities associated with offshore oil development any site in the city would have debilitating effects on the local economy and environment 2 groundwater the city relies solely on finite groundwater basins currently in overdraft conditions resulting in a complete building moratorium which has only been partially alleviated there is not sufficient water to accommodate any oil support facilities in the city 3 general plan housing element the goals for 1986 in the general plan housing element particularly for affordable housing are not being met due to lack of water location of oil crews in morro bay would put greater demand for housing than could be met thereby displacing lower income residents d consistency 1 general plan this chapter is consistent with the citys general plan 2 local coastal program this
