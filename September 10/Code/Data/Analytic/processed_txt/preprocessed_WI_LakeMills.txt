the city attorneys stead and such persons shall be funded from the city attorneys budget out of monies allocated for professional services b notwithstanding the foregoing the city attorney is

herself from action on an item the chair or president or presiding officer of the body shall be notified in writing prior to the meeting that the incumbent although absent from the meeting is disqualifying himself or herself from all discussion and action on the particular item this notification shall be made part of the minutes of that meeting failure to so notify the appropriate person of the disqualification despite the members absence shall be considered a violation of this section a if an incumbent may not cast a vote due to a conflict of interest and if the incumbent has disqualified himself or herself from the vote the lack of vote by the incumbent shall be recorded as an abstention and such vote shall not be counted for determining 1 the number of members present if passage of that measure requires a favorable vote by a majority or other fractional vote ie 23 or 34 of the members present  or 2 the presence of a quorum for purposes of that particular vote b if the vote requires that all members of the body be counted for purposes of determining whether a majority of all the members voted as opposed to whether a majority of the members present voted the disqualified members disqualification shall not be counted as a portion of the total number of members for purposes of determining 1 whether a majority were present for quorum reasons for that vote  or 2 whether a favorable vote was cast by a majority of the members or other required fractional number of the total members c by way of example under if a body has five members and a 23 vote of the members present is required and one member is absent and one member is disqualified and the vote is two in favor and one against a measure the disqualified persons lack of vote will not be counted among the number of members present so the resulting vote will be recorded as 21 and the measure will pass because a 23 vote of the members present had voted in favor of the measure d by way of example under if a body has five members but one vacancy exists and only four members may then be present to vote on any measure before the body until the vacancy is filled the total number of all members is still considered to be five if one member is disqualified and a simple majority vote is required for the measure to pass the majority of all members required for the vote to pass would be three votes in favor the three voting members at the meeting cast a  716 general provisions  717   718 ethics board vote of 21 under this scenario only two members voted in favor of the measure but since three were needed the measure fails if under a body has five members but one member is disqualified from voting due to a conflict of interest and a 23 or 34 vote is required of all members that disqualified member is not counted for the purpose of determining if the required number of votes were cast for the measure to pass e notwithstanding the foregoing subsections if the effect of the disqualification on the official duties is so pervasive and so permanent in nature that a reasonable person would believe that a de facto vacancy exists in the office or position the incumbent is encouraged to remove the source of the ongoing disqualification or resign a the ethics board of the city of lake mills is hereby abolished and recreated the newly created ethics board shall consist of

claimed to produce intoxicating effects similar to thc or marijuana  2 while the substances are not yet categorized as illegal controlled substances under wisconsin or federal law several countries states and municipalities have already taken action to prohibit these substances due to overdoses and other negative health concerns  3 while these synthetic cannabinoid substances are often marketed as benign and legal alternatives to marijuana they are potentially dangerous to users because the substances can create potency from 3 to 100 times greater than marijuana can produce severe adverse health conditions such as hallucinations paranoia increased agitation heart palpitations seizures and vomiting based on emergency room experiences in areas of the country where use is more prevalent

additionally it has been found that business practices convenient cash businesses are susceptible to attracting criminals seeking to commit robberies finally when clustered in an area or strung out

purposes of this chapter and the city of lake mills comprehensive plan in terms of limiting the spread of strip commercial development  of which advertising signs are a primary contributor furthermore

greater for the highest dewatering pumping rate if the water is demonstrated to have no particles of greater than 100 microns during dewatering operations then no control is needed before discharge except as determined by the city building inspector water may not be discharged in a manner that caused erosion of the site or receiving channels note there are many ways to meet this particle size performance objective depending on the pumping rate as an example if the pumping rate is very low 1 galmin then an inclined or vertical enlargement pipe about eightinch diameter for one gallon per minutes several feet long would be an adequate control device to restrict the discharge of 100 micron and larger particles as the pumping rate increases then the device must be enlarged at a moderate 100 gallons per minute pumping rate a vertical section of corrugated steel pipe or concrete pipe section or other small tank about 4 12 feet across for a 100 gallons per minute pumping rate several feet tall would be adequate with these pipe sections or small tanks inlet baffles would be needed to minimize turbulence with very large pumping rates 10000 gallons per minute sediment basins about 35 feet in diameter for a pumping rate of 10000 gallons per minute at least three feet in depth with a simple but adequately sized pipe outlet would be needed more sophisticated control devices such as swirl concentrators or hydrocyclones could be specifically fabricated that would generally be smaller than the simple sedimentation devices described above but they would not be required b waste and

accordance with the procedures set forth in the municipal purpose the city of lake mills recognizes the environmental benefits associated with the use of geothermalground source heat pump gshp systems for heating and cooling gshp systems offer the benefit of reduced generation of air pollution including greenhouse gases in comparison with conventional heating and cooling systems the potential environmental and human health risks associated with an accidental release of the gshp fluids that are permitted under this section are relatively low the main goal of these guidelines is to have gshp wells and systems sited in a manner that will not adversely affect  660167 lake mills code  660168  abutting properties and that are installed in a manner that will not provide potential contaminant pathways that would allow surface runoff to enter groundwater aquifers or the transfer of natural or manmade contamination between two different aquifers or between aquifers and surface water bodies an additional goal of these guidelines is to minimize the potential for subsurface system leaks b types of systems and typical arrangement 1 closedloop system horizontal horizontal ground source heat pump installation is generally most costeffective for residential installations particularly for new construction where sufficient land is available it requires trenches at least four feet deep the most common layouts either use two pipes one buried at six feet and the other at four feet or two pipes placed sidebyside at five feet in the ground in a twofoot wide trench the method of looping pipe allows more pipe in a shorter trench which cuts down on installation costs and makes horizontal installation possible in areas it would not be with conventional horizontal applications 2 closed loop system vertical vertical systems are often used for large commercial buildings and schools because the land area required for horizontal loops would be prohibitive vertical loops are also used where the soil is too shallow for trenching and they minimize the disturbance to existing landscaping for a vertical system holes approximately four inches in diameter are drilled about 20 feet apart and 100 feet to 400 feet deep into these holes go two pipes that are connected at the bottom with a ubend to form a loop the vertical loops are connected with horizontal pipe ie manifold placed in trenches and connected to the heat pump in the building 3 closed loop system pondlake the coils are placed in an open water source pond or lake that meets minimum volume depth and quality criteria a supply line pipe is run underground from the building to the water source and coiled into circles at least eight feet under the surface to prevent freezing 4 openloop system this system uses a well or surface water body such as a pond or lake as the heat exchange fluid that circulates directly ground source heat pump system once the water has circulated system it returns to the ground well a recharge well or surface discharge this option is only practical where there is an adequate supply of relatively clean water and all regulations regarding groundwater discharge are met c prohibitions gshp wells or systems shall not be located constructed or operated in a manner that will cause further degradation of aquifers wetlands or surface water bodies  660168 general provisions  660168  d

this section are designed to ensure that all proposed land use and development activity complies with the requirements of this chapter specifically this section requires that the initiation of all development activity including building permits zoning certificates occupancy permits for a change of use of an existing lot or structure where there is contemplated a site plan revision clear cutting grading or filling require the approval of building site and operational plans by the city before the building occupancy and building permits can be issued  except however that development activity associated with an approved final plat of subdivision for singlefamily andor duplextwin home dwelling units and development activity associated with the full and complete implementation of a project approved within the pip phase of the planned development pdd is exempt from this requirement b applicability of this section 1 the procedures to be followed in this section shall be applicable to design building and operational plans for all construction or external remodeling or enlargement of any primary or accessory structure if such construction or external remodeling requires a building permit and if such development activity is located within the b1 b2 pb r312 i1 i2 or pi zoning districts unless said district specifically provides for an exemption from either site plan approval or
