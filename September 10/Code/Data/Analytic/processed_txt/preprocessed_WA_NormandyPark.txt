stormwater and erosion control especially that which preserves and utilizes the many values of the citys natural drainage system including open space fish and wildlife habitat recreation and education the council also finds that the city of normandy park should conduct programs to reduce flooding erosion and sedimentation  prevent and mitigate habitat loss  enhance groundwater recharge  and prevent water quality degradation implementation of comprehensive and thorough permit review construction inspection enforcement and maintenance in order to promote the effectiveness of the requirements contained in this chapter in addition the purpose of this chapter is to protect the citys surface and groundwater quality by providing minimum requirements for reducing and controlling the discharge of contaminants the city council recognizes that water quality degradation can result either directly from one discharge or collective impact of many small discharges therefore this chapter prohibits the discharge of contaminants into surface and stormwater and groundwater in accordance with rcw and outlines preventive measures to restrict contaminants from entering such waters these measures include the implementation of best management practices bmps by the residents and businesses of the city furthermore the normandy park city council finds this chapter necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of the residents of normandy park and the integrity of the citys resources for the benefit of all by minimizing or eliminating water quality degradation  preserving and enhancing the suitability of waters for recreation fishing and other beneficial uses  and preserving and enhancing the aesthetic quality and biotic integrity of the water the city council recognizes that implementation of this chapter is required under the federal clean water act 33 usc 1251 et seq in meeting the intent of the clean water act the city council also recognizes the importance of maintaining economic viability while providing necessary environmental protection and believes this chapter helps achieve both goals exh 2 2017    scope compliance with the standards in this chapter

of concern but did not indicate specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a dns the city shall make the threshold determination issuing a dn or ds as appropriate  cthe applicants proposed mitigation measures clarifications changes or conditions must be in writing and must be specific for example proposals to control noise or prevent stormwater runoff are inadequate whereas proposals to muffle machinery to x decibel or construct 200 foot stormwater retention pond at y location are adequate dmitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated dns may be incorporated in the dns by reference to agency staff reports studies or other documents 6mitigated dnss issued under wac 197113402 require a 14day comment period and public notice 7mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated dns shall be deemed conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same manner as any term or condition of the permit or enforced in any manner specifically prescribed by the city 8if the citys tentative decision on a permit or approval does not include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated dns for the proposal the city should evaluate the threshold determination to assure consistency with wac 197113403a withdrawal of dns 9the citys written response under subsection 2 of this section shall not be construed as a determination of

responsibility 1the shoreline management act of 1971 was adopted in 1972 rcw it is the policy of the state to provide for the management of the shorelines of the state by planning for and fostering all reasonable and appropriate uses this policy is designed to ensure the development of these shorelines in a manner which while allowing for limited reduction of rights of the public in the navigable waters will promote and enhance the public interest this policy contemplates protecting against adverse effects to the public health the land and its vegetation and wildlife and the waters of the state and their aquatic life while protecting generally public rights of navigation and corollary rights incidental thereto 2primary responsibility for shoreline regulation and planning is given to local governments with the department of ecology acting in a review and watchdog capacity where a local shoreline is part of a designated shoreline of statewide significance as in the case of areas seaward of extreme low tide in normandy park local governments are required to give priority to statewide objectives and goals enumerated in rcw  for that portion of the shoreline so designated the department in adopting guidelines for shorelines of statewide significance and the local government in developing master programs for shorelines of statewide significance shall give priority to uses in the following order of preference which arecognize and protect the statewide interest over local interests  bpreserve the natural character of the shoreline  cresult in longterm over shortterm benefit  dprotect the resources and ecology of the shoreline  eincrease public access to publicly owned areas of the shorelines  fincrease recreational opportunities for the public  and g provide for any other element as defined in rcw  deemed appropriate or necessary shoreline master programs smps serve as standards for implementation of state policy set forth in rcw for regulation of shoreline uses the master programs articulate local policies and use regulations governing the physical development of land and water resources affecting shorelands these regulations are in addition to other ordinances rules and regulations of the city exh a 2016   1991  area of jurisdiction 1the shoreline area covered by the normandy park smp is approximately three miles along puget sound which is a shoreline of statewide significance see appendix a map of shoreline designations figure 1 the entire shoreline area is designated under five environments rural residential environment urban conservancy beach community bluff conservancy and aquatic the shoreline extends from the des moinesnormandy park city limits on the south to approximately sw 176th street on the north at the buriennormandy park border the eastern shoreward boundary is 200 feet landward of the ordinary high water mark the western seaward boundary is the minus 100foot underwater contour generally 400 feet seaward of the ordinary high water mark 2in accordance with the 1972 shoreline management act as amended in 200 that portion of the normandy park shoreline area between the extreme low water mark and the minus 100foot contour which is permanently underwater is a publicly owned area of statewide significance where statewide shoreline interests take precedence over local shoreline interests extensive tidelands are exposed at low tide all along the normandy park shoreline which are primarily held by private landowners marine view park is cityowned and provides the only public access to those publicly owned shorelands which by definition remain underwater private recreational opportunities also exist for property owners living within tract 611750trct referred to as lot a at the normandy park cove 3unless specifically exempted by statute all proposed uses and development occurring within shoreline jurisdiction must conform to rcw the shoreline management act and this master program whether or not a permit is required exh a 2016   1991  compliance in normandy park 1since 1974 the normandy park shoreline area has been controlled by the 1973 normandy park shoreline master program the area extending from sw 208th street to the city of des moines has been regulated by the king county shoreline master program of 1977 the overall goal of the smp is to control and regulate future development as it affects the shoreline area ensuring that the private sectors right to use does not infringe upon the publics right to enjoy and use the shoreline of puget sound without having to trespass on private uplands or tidelands in recognition of the limitations of the natural environment shoreline development activities and uses are to be regulated in a manner that assures shoreline uses with minimal adverse environmental effects and that preserves unique natural resources and shoreline features having historic cultural scientific and educational value 2the shoreline management act sets forth three primary tasks to be fulfilled by local governments aadministration of a shoreline permit system for proposed substantial development on wetlands of designated water bodies bcompilation of a comprehensive inventory which includes a survey of natural characteristics present land uses and patterns of property ownership cdevelopment of a master program to provide an objective guide for regulating the use of shorelines 3the normandy park shoreline master program smp refers to the citys comprehensive plan zoning code and other development plans and ordinances for which this smp has relevance smp use regulations are however a legally separate and standalone set of regulations enabled by the shoreline management act of 1971 or as amended thereafter rcw 4development within the shoreline area must conform to the citys general requirements and the smp in case of conflict the stricter requirement applies 5under the smp a permit must be obtained from the city for any proposed substantial development within normandy park shoreline 6substantial development according to the act means any development where the total cost or fair market value exceeds $6400 or the current dollar threshold determined by the state as described in wac 173270402a whichever is greater or any development that would interfere with the normal public use of the water or shorelines 7however any development which occurs within the citys shoreline area as shown in appendix a map of shoreline designations figure 1 and as defined by the act whether it requires a permit or not must be consistent with the intent of the act exh a 2016     1991  citizen involvement 1with assistance from local residents the current master program was developed between 2009 and 2013 as an update of the previous smp in order to incorporate shorelines annexed by the city since 1973 and to reflect recent changes in state requirements and community preferences the program presents a description of natural processes an enumeration of objectives and policies for shoreline development designation of shoreline environments use regulations and provisions for variances conditional uses unclassified uses and updating the smp 2during a threeyear period the technical advisory committee and the city council reviewed and accepted citizen input to this normandy park shoreline master program citizen input was solicited and received from local newspaper articles public meetings phone calls and discussions with residents by the citizen advisory committee planning commission and city council meeting discussions based on this participation it is felt that this resulting smp represents the wishes of the citizens of normandy park within the constraints of existing federal state and

an urban conservancy environment designation is assigned to areas within shoreline jurisdiction that are suitable for public including community access and unlimited general access or private access waterenjoyment recreational uses and active recreation developments these are areas that are developed at a low density including outdoor recreation the urban conservancy environment is designated for marine view park and a portion of the mouth of miller and walker creeks see appendix a map of shoreline designations figure 1 3management policies auses that preserve or restore the natural character of the shoreline area or promote preservation of open space and critical areas should be the primary allowed uses bpublic and private access and public and private recreation objectives should be implemented if feasible and wherever any significant ecological impacts can be mitigated cwateroriented uses should be given priority over nonwateroriented uses with waterdependent uses given the highest priority dnew development should be designed and located to preclude the need for shoreline armoring vegetation removal flood control and other shoreline modifications estandards should be established for shoreline stabilization measures vegetation conservation water quality and shoreline modifications these standards shall ensure that new development or redevelopment does not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological functions or further degrade other shoreline values exh a 2016  bluff conservancy 1purpose the purpose of the bluff conservancy environment is to protect those shoreline areas that are steep feeder bluffs that are relatively free of human influence or that include intact or minimally degraded shoreline functions sensitive of human use this designation is meant to be an overlay over rural residential designation where singlefamily residences are on top of feeder bluffs these systems require that only very lowintensity uses be allowed in order to maintain the ecological functions and ecosystemwide processes restoration of the shoreline and shoreline functions where feasible and permitted under the normandy park is encouraged in this environment 2criteria for designation abluff conservancy environment designation should be assigned to shoreline areas if any of the following characteristics apply ithe shoreline is undeveloped and contains feeder bluff habitat and therefore is currently performing an important irreplaceable function or ecosystemwide process that would be impaired by human activity iithe shoreline is unable to support new development or uses without significant adverse impacts to ecological functions or risk to human safety iiiuses in the bluff conservancy include low impact recreation and natural resourcebased lowintensity activities such shoreline areas include largely undisturbed portions of shoreline areas such as wetlands estuaries unstable bluffs coastal dunes spits and ecologically intact shoreline habitats ecologically intact shorelines as used here means those shoreline areas that retain the majority of their natural shoreline functions as evidenced by the shoreline configuration and the presence of native vegetation generally but not necessarily ecologically intact shorelines are free of structural shoreline modifications structures and intensive human uses in forested areas they generally include native vegetation with diverse plant communities multiple canopy layers and the presence of large woody debris available for recruitment to adjacent water bodies recognizing that there is a continuum of ecological conditions ranging from nearnatural conditions to totally degraded and contaminated sites this term is intended to delineate those shoreline areas that provide valuable functions for the larger aquatic and terrestrial environments which could be lost or significantly reduced by human development or have risk to human safety if they were developed whether or not a shoreline is ecologically intact is determined on a casebycase basis the term ecologically intact shorelines applies to all shoreline areas meeting the above criteria ranging from larger reaches that may include multiple properties to small areas located within a single property 3management policies aany use that would degrade the ecological functions or natural character of the shoreline area should not be allowed bthe following new uses should not be allowed in the bluff conservancy environment i residential development iicommercial uses iiinonwateroriented

dnotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the smp or normandy park existing shoreline stabilization structures may be allowed to remain and be maintained subject to approval by the city where existing shoreline stabilization measures are allowed to be repaired or rebuilt softarmoring should be used where feasible to protect ecological functions and be consistent with the purpose of this environment rebuilt shoreline stabilization measures shall be placed above the ordinary high water mark where feasible escientific historical cultural educational research uses and lowintensity wateroriented recreational access uses may be allowed  provided that no significant ecological impact on the area will result fdevelopment or significant vegetation removal that would reduce the capability of vegetation to perform normal ecological functions should not be allowed the subdivision of property in a configuration that to achieve its intended purpose will require significant vegetation removal or shoreline modification that adversely impacts ecological functions is not allowed that is each new parcel must be able to support its intended development without significant ecological impacts to the shoreline ecological functions exh a 2016  beach community 1purpose the purpose of the beach community environment is to recognize the unique community of singlefamily residential uses and to protect the safety of the residences while protecting existing ecological functions and restoring ecological functions in areas that have been previously degraded where feasible the beach community environment would maintain open spaces and opportunities for recreational uses compatible with the beach residential uses protection of the natural shoreline environment and its resources is encouraged due to the potential for damage to structures in this designation and the physical constraints to repair and redevelopment removal of structures restoration of the natural shoreline and change of use to conservation is encouraged the following identifies the objectives for the beach community designation in order of importance aprotect the unique characteristics of these communities while minimizing the impact to critical areas and natural shoreline processes  baccommodate the functional reuse of residential structures and safety of its residences  and cencourage restoration of natural shoreline removal of all structures or placing properties in conservation where residential structures and property have been substantially damaged 2criteria for designation the beach community designation is an area largely occupied by the collection of unique singlefamily residences and seasonal singlefamily residences some residences are located on the beach and are prone to storm damage the area is free from intensive development and does not include any multifamily residential commercial or industrial development the beach community designation includes sensitive areas such as beaches steep slopes eroding feeder bluffs heavily wooded areas and flood zones 3management policies awhen substantial redevelopment or development activities occur on
