significant residential and commercial revitalization has occurred in this area of the city and while revitalization enhances the economic and social viability of the city by growing and fortifying the tax base and providing additional employment and housing opportunities increased traffic both vehicular and pedestrian is an inevitable byproduct c the built environment in this area of the city

52802 the operation of rickshaws regulated a city council hereby makes the following findings of fact 1 the number of persons using the public streets in the peninsula area of the city of charleston in the recent years has increased dramatically due to an expanded commercial use and the growing tourism industry as a result congestion on the streets in the peninsula area has increased because of a rise in the number of vehicles and pedestrians using the streets and sidewalks 2 rickshaws pickup and discharge passengers at numerous locations in the peninsula area and tend to congregate at or near restaurants places of assembly and the market area the continued proliferation of rickshaws in the peninsula area tends to create a carnival or themepark atmosphere which is destructive of the historic and traditional ambiance of the peninsula area which is substantially made up of eighteenth and nineteenth century structures therefore in order to protect the historic and traditional ambiance of the peninsula area city council finds it necessary to regulate rickshaws operating on the public rightofways in the peninsula area 3 rickshaws as hereinafter defined are by their design and nature slow moving and pose a potential danger for those using the vehicles and the streets the unregulated operations of rickshaws on the streets of the peninsula area would add to the congestion in the streets and would greatly inconvenience if not endanger users of the streets in the area as a result it is in the public interest and for the publics safety and welfare that the users of the public rightofways be protected from unregulated vehicles which hinder travel or which pose dangers or distractions which give rise to accidents and inconvenience 4 the city approved a rickshaw pilot program  authorizing additional rickshaw tokens to be distributed for night time use as a result of the token pilot program city council believes that there is an increasing demand for the use of rickshaws by residents and visitors in the district and that a limited increase in the number of rickshaws permitted in the district is in the publics best interest  5 city council further finds for the same reasons that electric oil or gasoline powered rickshaws in operation in the peninsula area would not be in the public interest  71707   41211 definitions the following words and terms are

incident to the adoption of the ordinance from which this section derives the city council city council of the city of charleston south carolina the city makes the following findings 1 the city is an incorporated municipality and as such possesses all powers granted to municipalities by the constitution and the laws of the state of south carolina including the powers enumerated in sc relating to regulating streets markets and public health  and 2 numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing second hand smoke also known as environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart disease stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer the national cancer institute has determined that second hand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to 65000 americans annually the surgeon general has declared that i secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in nonsmokers exposed to smoke  ii children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for sudden death syndrome acute respiratory infections ear problems and more severe asthma  iii adults exposed to secondary smoke have a higher risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer  iv there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke v separating smoking and nonsmoking sections of indoor areas does not sufficiently remove the threats of secondhand smoke in enclosed areas  and 3 a significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace studies have shown that employees who work in smokefilled businesses suffer a twentyfive 25 to fifty 50 percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function 4 studies have also shown that smokefilled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease lower productivity higher cleaning and maintenance costs increased health insurance rates and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke 5 there are laws ordinances and regulations in place that protect workers from other environmental hazards including class a carcinogens asbestos arsenic and benzene but none which regulate exposure to environmental tobacco smoke  and 6 prohibiting smoking in the workplace increases public awareness of the negative health effects of smoking reduces the social acceptability of smoking and reduces harm to children and other nonsmokers  and 7 the south carolina general assembly at et seq the clean indoor air act of 1990 imposed certain limitations on smoking for example it limited smoking in government buildings the definition of which includes cityowned buildings except where the owner of such building shall designate smoking areas consistent with the clean indoor air act of 199 city council previously adopted section 21131 of the city that ordinance

smoke and in furtherance of the objectives of the clean indoor act of 199 deems it to be in the public interest to regulate smoking in cityowned or operated indoor facilities city council has now determined that additional regulation of smoking in areas beyond those addressed in the clean indoor air act of 1990 and section 21131 is appropriate in furtherance of its duty to protect the health

the management of stormwater runoff and sediment is necessary to reduce pollution siltation sedimentation local flooding and stream channel erosion all of which impact adversely on land and water resources and the health safety property and welfare of the residents of the city  b the city maintains a system of stormwater management facilities including but not limited to inlets conduits manholes channels ditches drainage easements retention and detention basins infiltration facilities and other components as well as natural waterways  c the stormwater management facilities and components of the city need to be regularly rehabilitated upgraded or expanded and additional stormwater management facilities and measures need to be installed throughout the city  d the city needs to upgrade its capability to maintain existing and future stormwater management facilities and measures  e every parcel of improved real property in the city both uses or benefits from the stormwater management system  and the improvement of existing facilities and construction of additional facilities in the system will directly benefit the owners of all improved real estate  f continued growth in the city will contribute to the need for improvements to and maintenance of the stormwater management system  g the extent of use of the stormwater management system by each parcel of improved real property is dependent on factors that influence runoff such as land use intensity of development amount of impervious surface and location in a particular watershed or basin  h owners of improved real property and users should finance the stormwater management system to the extent they contribute to the need for the system and derive special benefits therefrom and charges therefore should bear a substantial relationship to the cost of the service  i it is in the best interests of the citizens of this city and most specifically the owners of improved property that a stormwater management

council finds and declares that because the number of tourists coming to the city in recent years has increased dramatically it is in the public interest that sightseeing vehicles tour guides and certain commercial passenger vehicles which travel in the old city district and old and historic district of the city be regulated under the police power of the city it is the purpose of such regulation to maintain protect and promote the tourism industry and economy of the city and at the same time to maintain and protect the tax base and land values of the city to reduce unnecessary traffic and pollution and to maintain and promote aesthetic charm and the quality of life for the residents of the city the city council finds further that the numbers of unregulated tour vehicles and other commercial vehicles entering the city for the purpose of touring the historic districts are having adverse effects upon the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city and that traffic accidents damage to property traffic congestion and other problems require the enactment by the city of a comprehensive tourism management ordinance the council also finds that responsibilities for tourism management are of sufficient scope and complexity to justify a separate ordinance and organizational entity from that required for the administration of the arts and history interests of the

district and the old city district the districts in the recent years has increased dramatically due to an expanded commercial use and the growing tourism industry as a result the streets in the districts have increased congestion because of a rise in the number of vehicles motorized and pedestrian using the streets 2 to protect the historic and traditional ambiance of the districts which not only promotes the welfare of the residents living therein but also the welfare of the community at large due to the economic benefits generated by a viable and healthy tourism industry and to promote and protect the safety of those using the streets in the districts whether they be visitors or citizens city council finds it necessary to restrict access to the streets in the districts to certain vehicles 3 articulated vehicles and theme vehicles as defined in section 292 are by their design and nature distracting elongated slow moving bulky and cumbersome and by their appearance not in keeping with the ambiance of the old city district or old and historic district 4 control of access to and from such vehicles by users or pedestrians to and from the sidewalks or public streets is not readily manageable thereby posing a potential danger for those using the vehicles and for those using the streets and sidewalks be they pedestrians or persons in or on other vehicles 5 articulated vehicles and theme vehicles on the streets of the old city district and old and historic district would be detrimental to the ambiance and environment of the districts and would add to congestion in the streets and would greatly inconvenience if not endanger users of the streets and sidewalks in the districts all to the detriment of the character of the districts the residents of the districts and the visitors to the districts 6 it is in the public interest and for the public safety and welfare that the streets in the districts and the users thereof be protected from unreasonable encroachments or vehicles which hinder travel or which pose dangers or distractions which give rise to accidents and inconvenience  92298 articulated vehicles prohibited it shall be unlawful for any

footnotes  5  editors note  adopted  added a new 312 inasmuch as these sections already exist in to avoid duplication of section numbers these sections have been renumbered as  54299215429933 at the discretion of the editor   findings numerous studies and plans suggest the area of the peninsula lying generally to the east of interstate 26 and north of huger street upper peninsula district is well suited for greater density and increased building height due to its connectivity to major transportation routes such as i26 highway 17 highway 52 and highway 78 the expansive nature of its existing infrastructure and its relatively sparse population as compared to other areas of the peninsula the character of the upper peninsula district is distinct and different from other areas of the peninsula in that there is not a predominance of historic buildings thus presenting an opportunity for buildings to be sized and designed in a manner that incorporates architectural features characteristic to charleston but which also take advantage of the geographic features of the area as the potential for views of both the ashley and cooper rivers exist after receiving valuable input from various sectors of the public including residents neighborhood leaders area businesses and nonprofit groups preservation organizations developers real estate professionals designers and green

former 974 in its entirety and enacted new provisions as herein set out former pertained to a temporary moratorium on late night bar permits in the commercial corridors of king east bay and market

property damage and compromise public safety notwithstanding ongoing efforts by the city to study and model the drainage conditions in the basin and to update and implement regulations to alleviate flooding conditions there it is evident that absent a thorough evaluation of the drainage patterns in portions of the basin of the development and infrastructure in place and of development that will reasonably occur in these areas in the immediate future development in the basin both existing and planned will be threatened as well as the quality of life of those who live and work there now and those who will in the future the public health and safety and the economic wellbeing of the city and of its residents who live work and shop in the affected area demand that measures be taken to
