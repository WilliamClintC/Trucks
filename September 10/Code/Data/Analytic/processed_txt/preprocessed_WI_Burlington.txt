requirements that may be imposed by the administrative rules permits or approvals of the department of natural resources including but not limited to those authorized under  28333 wis stats  2702 findings of fact the common council finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from land development and land redevelopment activity has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled stormwater runoff can degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing stream bed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life and recreational and water supply uses by increasing loadings of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainageways and other minor drainage facilities threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  2703 purpose and intent purpose the general purpose of this chapter is to set forth stormwater requirements and criteria which will diminish the threats to public health safety and welfare and the aquatic environment due to runoff of stormwater from land development and land redevelopment activity specific purposes are to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater prevent and control soil erosion prevent and control water pollution and protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies prevent undue channel erosion control increases in the scouring and

land uses and promote sound economic growth minimize the amount of pollutants discharged from the separate storm sewer to protect the waters of the state intent it is the intent of the common council that this chapter manage the longterm postconstruction stormwater discharges from land development and land redevelopment activities by achieving a specific set of performance standards at locations where it applies this chapter can be applied on a sitebysite basis the common council recognizes however that the preferred method of achieving the stormwater performance standards set forth in this chapter is preparation and implementation of comprehensive systemslevel stormwater management plans that cover hydrologic units such as watersheds on a municipal and regional scale such plans may prescribe alternative applicability and performance standards for specific sites when the overall performance standards can be met in a more costeffective approach where such plans have been developed and approved by the common council it is the intent of this chapter that land development and redevelopment activity as defined in  2704 will be required to meet the stormwater management measures set forth in the approved plan where such stormwater management plans have not been developed and approved by the common council it is the intent that the stormwater management standards set forth in  2707a and b of this chapter be applied unless otherwise excepted by the common council this chapter shall not apply to lands on which the only structures are buildings existing on the effective date
