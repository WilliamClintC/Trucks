performance guarantee has been approved in accordance with c of this appendix c road tree list introduction the selection of tree species to plant along roadsides sidewalks and parking lots including in islands and esplanades is governed by the towns commitment to maintaining a sustainable forest canopy sustainability requires managing for diversity at the genus level and to the extent possible selecting tree species from genera that are considered less susceptible to exotic tree pathogens the towns goal is to work toward a forest canopy in which no more than 5% of trees are from the same genus prohibited species at the present time trees species from the following genera are not approved for planting acer maples betula birches fraxinus ashes quercus oaks populus aspens and tsuga hemlocks priority species the following tree species are from monotypic genera ie each genus has only one species and are thus considered highly resistant to exotic tree pests these trees may not be appropriate for many locations but they should receive priority consideration when site characteristics are appropriate these tree species are recommended for planting to meet the road tree requirements subject to final approval by the tree warden based on site characteristics the list includes the scientific and common tree name whether the tree is native to maine expected height at

the tree species listed above unless specifically identified above require approval of the tree warden esplanade and islands the key to planting sustainable trees in esplanades and islands is to

or island must be accompanied by an analysis of available soil volume and reference to a soil volume table or other guide showing the soil volume available is sufficient to support the tree selected site and tree characteristics tree species vary in their environmental needs and response to site characteristics just because a tree species is listed above doesnt mean it is the right tree for a particular location site characteristics such as moisture presence of roadside or aerial salts soil ph and sun exposure must all be considered in selecting the right tree for the right location tree characteristics such as expected height and crown spread at maturity fruit dropping and presence of thorns must also be considered for particular sites tree warden approval is required to help ensure that site and tree characteristics are appropriate for a desired planting location 48 appendix d turnaround designs  of 2 49 appendix d turnaround designs  of 2 50 appendix e road cross road 51
