citizens of the city and the state of south dakota however livestock poultry and other animals produce manure which may where improperly stored transported or disposed negatively affect the city environment animal manure must be controlled where it may add to air surface water ground water or land pollution the following regulations have been adopted to provide protection against pollution caused by manure from domesticated animals all new and proposed expansions of concentrated animal feeding operations shall comply with the regulations as outline herein it is the intention of the board of adjustment in the enforcement of this ordinance that when an operator of an existing concentrated animal feeding operation applies for a permit to expand to another class level the standards that apply to the expansion will not be applied to existing structures that were built in compliance with accepted industry standards in existence at the time of the construction of such facilities a special exception can be issued see special exception in the city of mobridge zoning regulations definitions animal manure poultry livestock or other animal excreta or mixture of excreta with feed bedding or other materials animal unit a unit of measure for livestock equated as follows  one animal unit is equivalent to 1 cow feeder or slaughter beef animal excluding calves under 300 pounds  05

workers nonfarm dwelling any occupied dwelling which is not a farm dwelling permit a permit required by these regulations unless stated otherwise potential pollution hazard a concentrated animal feeding operation of 50 to 499 animal units may be classified as a class d operation by the city zoning officer when a potential pollution hazard exists factors to be considered by the zoning officer in determining a potential pollution hazard include the following 1the concentrated animal feeding operation does not meet the minimum setback andseparation distances of these regulations 2a potential water pollution hazard exists due to sitting over a shallow aquifer or drainagewhich contributes to the waters of the state process generated wastewater water directly or indirectly used in the operation of an animalfeeding operation the term includes spillage or overflow from water systems  water and manure collected while washing cleaning or flushing pens barns manure pits or otherareas  water and manure collected during direct contact swimming washing or spray cooling ofanimals  and water used in dust control process wastewater process wastewater means any process generated wastewater and any precipitation rain or snow that comes into contact with the animals manure litter or bedding feed or other portions of the animal feeding operation the term includes runoff from an open lot shall shall means that the condition is an enforceable requirement of this permit shallow aquifer an aquifer vulnerable to contamination because the permeable material making up the aquifer a extends to the land surface so percolation water can easily transport contaminants from land surface to the aquifer or b extends to near the land surface and lacks a sufficiently thick layer of impermeable material on the land or near the land surface to limit percolation water from transporting contaminants from the land surface to the aquifer shallow well a well which is located in a shallow aquifer should should means that the condition is a recommendation if violations of the permit occur the city will evaluate whether the producer implemented the recommendations contained in this permit that may have helped the producer to avoid the violation 100 significant contributor of pollution to determine if a concentrated animal feeding operation meets this definition the following factors are considered 1 size of feeding operation and amount of manure reaching waters of the state  2 location of the feeding operation in relation to waters of the state  3 means of conveyance of manure and process wastewater into waters of the state  4 the slope vegetation rainfall and other factors affecting the likelihood or frequency of discharge of animal wastes and process wastewater into waters of the state water of the state means all waters within the jurisdiction of this state including all streams lake ponds impounding reservoirs marshes watercourses waterways wells springs irrigation systems drainage systems and all other bodies or accumulations of water surface and underground natural or artificial public or private situated wholly or partly within or

concentrated animal feeding operation is defined as a lot yard corral building or other area where animals have been are or will be stabled or confined for a total of 45 days or more during any 12month period and where crops vegetation forage growth or post harvest residues are not sustained over any portion of the lot or facility two or more animal feeding operations under common ownership are single animal operation if they adjoin each other or if they use a common area or system for disposal of manure for the purpose of these regulations concentrated animal feeding operations are divided into the following classes animal units class a 2000 or more class b 1000 to 1999 class c 300 to 999 class d 0 to 300 potential water pollution hazard class e 0 to 300 no pollution hazard
