action against a user for a bypass unless  bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage   there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and  the user submitted notices

cleaner ambient air level b definitions for the purpose of this section words and terms listed in this subsection as follows shall have the following meanings commuter vehicle  a motor vehicle parked

creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by the william t piper airport 2 that it is necessary in the interest of the public health safety morals and general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented 3 that the prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished to the extent legally possible by the exercise of the police power without compensation c it is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment of hazards to air

applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows a largerthanutility runway visual approach surface zone established beneath the visual approach surface the inner edge of this zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide the approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1500 feet at a horizontal distance of 5000 feet from the primary surface its center line is the continuation of the center line of the runway b transitional surface zones established beneath the transitional surfaces adjacent to each runway and approach surface as indicated on the height limitation and zoning district map c horizontal surface zone established beneath the horizontal surface 150 feet above the established airport elevation the perimeter of which is constructed by swinging arcs of fivethousandfoot radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs the horizontal surface zone does not include the approach surface and transitional surface zones d conical surface zone established beneath the conical surface the conical surface zone commences at the periphery of the horizontal surface and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4000 feet a utility runway visual approach surface zone slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same evaluation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5000 feet along the extended runway center line b transitional surface zones slopes seven feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport elevation which is 555 feet above mean sea level in addition to the foregoing when an airport has a precision instrument runway approach zone there are established height limits
