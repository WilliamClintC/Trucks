storm sewer facilities charges by this chapter the city elects to exercise such authority  832 findings and determinations in providing for such charges the findings and determinations set out in this section are made a in the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health safety convenience and general welfare the city has constructed operated and maintained a storm sewer system the system this section is adopted in the further exercise of such authority and for the same purposes b the system as constructed heretofore has been financed and paid for imposition of special assessments ad valorem taxes and storm water area charges such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used it is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of improving maintaining and operating the system additionally new regulations have been imposed which require upgrades to the system to address water quality issues to address the systems long term financial needs the city finds it reasonable to impose charges as provided in this chapter c in imposing charges it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable taking into account the status of completion of the system past methods of recovering system costs the topography of the city and other relevant factors it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected storm water runoff from the various parcels of land within the city d assigning costs and making charges based upon typical storm water runoff cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits the provisions of this chapter undertake to establish a reasonable and practical methodology for making such charges  833 rates and charges  sterling codifiers inc  191454 a land use rate calculation rates and charges for the use and availability of the system are to be determined use of a residential equivalent factor which assesses the amount of runoff from an acre of singlefamily urban development during a standard one year rainfall calculations for the storm water utility for other land uses are based upon their residential equivalency factor the rates for commercial industrial schools and churches land uses also take into consideration the amount of hard surface on the property and the acreage of the site  b calculation of fees the calculation of fees for the land uses within the city will be determined by the citys fee ordinance as amended from time to time c other land uses other land uses not listed in the fee ordinance table are to be classified by the city administrator by assigning them to the classes most nearly like the listed uses from the standpoint of probable hydrologic response appeals from the city administrators determination of the proper classifications may be made to the city council in the same manner as other appeals from administrative determinations d adjustments of charges the city council may by ordinance from time to time adopt policies providing for the adjustment of charges for parcels or grounds of parcels based upon hydrologic data supplied by affected property owners demonstrating an actual hydrologic response substantially different from the calculation being used for the parcel or parcels the adjustment may be made only after receiving the recommendation of the city administrator and may not be made effective retroactively if the adjustment would have the effect of changing the calculation for all or substantially all of the land uses in a particular classification however such adjustment must be accomplished by amending the calculation table found within the city fee ordinance table  e excluded

having vegetation as ground cover f supplying information the owner occupant or person in charge of any premises must supply the city with such information as the city may reasonably request related to the use development and area of the premises wilful failure to provide such information or to falsify it is a violation of this section g estimated charges if the owner occupant or person in charge of any premises fails or refuses to provide the information requested as provided above the charge for such premises must be estimated and billed in accordance with such estimate based upon information then available to the city h billings and collections the finance department shall render bills for charges for the use and availability of the system the council may also establish billing areas or districts and bill charges by calendar quarters or monthly quarters or such periodic intervals as the city council shall determine suitable and necessary bills are payable at the

on metropolitan county and city sewer and transportation facilities and plans and the adequate facility and infrastructure capacity is available concurrently with demands generated by new development in particular this intended to control the generation of peak period traffic on highway 6110 and the use of the cottage grove sewage treatment plant by imposing staged limits on the use of existing planned and programmed capacity b the cottage grove wastewater treatment plant operated by the metropolitan council environmental services division provides service to only cottage grove the plant has a capacity to treat 254 million gallons per day the plant is not projected to have an expansion for additional capacity prior to 2003 c the city has three hundred three 303 acres of residential fifty

projected to develop at an average rate of three percent 3% per year based on the development history of residential land use the city does not have adequate land within the musa to accommodate additional residential growth d in order to accommodate development of land within the musa and obtain a reasonable amount of additional residential land to be added to the musa without exceeding the current capacity of the plant the city is enacting an ordinance to allow development but only if there is adequate sewer plant capacity to serve new development  1172 application of provisions  sterling codifiers inc  369454 the provisions of this apply to land that is within the musa that has not received approval for development before  any development approved after  must comply with the
