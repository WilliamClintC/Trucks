borough council of the borough of fountain hill the borough has concluded that inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation changes the natural hydrologic patterns destroys aquatic habitats elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the borough and all of the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater federal and state regulations require the

modified for a specific application because of one or more of the following characteristics  the applicant proves that parking will be shared with another use that will reduce the total amount of parking needed because the uses have different peak times of parking need and that there is a legally guaranteed method to make sure that the parking will continue to be available during all of the
