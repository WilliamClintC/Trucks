purpose the b1 buffer zone is established to provide areas which allow for low intensity density and impact nonresidential uses to serve as a buffer area between existing or master planned residential areas and high traffic volume corridors railroad track corridors industrially zoned areas and general commercially zoned areas within the city the allowable uses should ideally use relatively large land areas and generate minimal vehicle trip generation rates allowable uses should also operate primarily during normal daytime business hours and not generate objectionable noise odors dust or fumes which could otherwise be incompatible with the residential uses being buffered it is not intended that the buffer zone be considered as just another commercial or industrial zone with which to strip zone existing traffic corridors nor is it intended that the buffer zone allow large amounts of commercial or light industrial property to compete with the existing and established commercial and industrial zoned areas of the city the permitted uses contained in this buffer zone are intended to be generally acceptable anywhere the buffer zone is established and could be generally acceptable as an immediately adjacent neighboring property to a low density singlefamily residence the conditional uses contained in this buffer zone are intended to be those uses which are acceptable within the buffer zone but may not be generally acceptable as an immediately adjacent neighboring property to singlefamily residence and therefore must be considered on a site specific basis  11102 permitted

should be considered in any site design many of the goals of cpted are supported by and accomplished the standards and guidelines already enumerated in this chapter in addition to these standards and guidelines other measures should be considered with the following four 4 overlapping cpted principles in mind 1 territoriality is a design concept that plainly demarcates private space from semipublic and public areas clear territoriality in the design of a site also creates a sense of ownership wherein people will be more likely to defend and care for such spaces following this principle ultimately creates an environment where intruders stand out and are more easily identified a symbolic barriers such as landscaping or changes in paving materials or patterns can be effective in creating defined public spaces b spaces which are designed for active use such as plazas outdoor seating and eating areas benches fountains and playgrounds add to the sense of ownership 2 natural surveillance is a design concept directed primarily at keeping intruders under observation provision of natural surveillance helps create environments where there is sufficient opportunity for people engaged in their normal behavior to observe the space around them areas can be designed so they are more easily observed a landscape designs and follow up maintenance that allows for clear unobstructed views of accessible areas  b walkways which are visible well lit and overlooked by windows from nearby buildings  c mixed uses that engage a site at all hours  d use of unglazed or tinted windows and doors  and e lighting of alcoves stairwells and other areas which may otherwise provide concealment 3 access control is a design concept directed primarily at decreasing criminal accessibility provision of natural access control limits access and increases natural surveillance to restrict criminal intrusion especially into areas where they will not be easily observed a clearly marking entrances  b restricting access to screened areas such as garbage receptacles delivery areas and outdoor storage areas  and c eliminating design elements which allow access to roofs and upper
