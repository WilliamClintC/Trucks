203 tobacco will account for 10 million deaths per year making it the greatest cause of death worldwide  and the united states surgeon general has concluded that there is no riskfree level of exposure to secondhand smoke and neither separating smokers from nonsmokers nor installing ventilation systems effectively eliminates secondhand smoke  and the united states environmental protection agency has found secondhand smoke to be a risk to public health and has classified secondhand smoke as a group a carcinogen the most dangerous class of carcinogen  and the california air resources board has put secondhand smoke in the same category as the most toxic automotive and industrial air pollutants by categorizing it as a toxic air contaminant  and the california office of environmental health hazard assessment has included secondhand smoke on the proposition 65 list of chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer birth defects and other reproductive harm  and exposure to secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in this country killing over 52000 nonsmokers each year including 3000 deaths from lung cancer  and secondhand smoke exposure adversely affects fetal growth with elevated risk of low birth weight and increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome in infants of mothers who smoke  and secondhand smoke exposure causes as many as 300000 children
