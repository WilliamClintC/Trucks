legislation passed  calistoga municipal floodplain management  of 870 variance procedure nature of variances  requests for variances  conditions for variances  nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this title are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  2000  requests for variances a the city council shall hear all requests for variances b in passing upon requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this title and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to

rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges c any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $2500 for $10000 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property 3 it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the napa recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land d the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and will report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency  2000  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of chapters 1816 and 1820 cmc have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases the calistoga municipal current legislation passed  calistoga municipal floodplain management  of 870 b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in cmc  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result  2000 title 19 the calistoga municipal current

calistoga municipal environmental protection  of 870 trees1 purpose  definitions  designations  requirements  violations and penalties  appeal  purpose a in enacting this chapter the council finds that this city is primarily a residential and tourist community and that the economics of property values is inseparably connected with the rural attractiveness of the area to which much is contributed by the wooded hillsides and the native and ornamental trees scattered throughout our city further the council finds that such trees contribute to the health safety welfare and wellbeing of the city and the residents thereof by 1 the establishment of natural watershed areas  2 the control of damage resulting from soil erosion and flooding  and 3 the known capacity of trees for the conversion to oxygen from carbon dioxide thereby reducing air pollution b the council finds that the destruction of trees injures the scenic beauty of the city  causes erosion of topsoil creates flood hazard and risk of landslides  reduces property values increases the cost of construction and maintenance of draining systems increased flow and diversion of surface waters  and eliminates one of the prime oxygen producers in this area c for these reasons the council finds it is in the public interest convenience and necessity to enact regulations controlling the removal of trees within this city
