based on the anticipated relative contribution of storm water drainage runoff volume and pollutant loading to the storm water drainage system a parcels contribution is determined by that parcels size and its land use under the principle that more intensively developed land uses typically have a larger percentage of impervious surface and contribute a much greater volume of water to the system for the standard rainfall event of 23 inches in 24 hours and larger pollutant loading bit is recognized that some parcels due either to their unique topographic vegetative geologic and other characteristics have a hydrologic response substantially different from that of similarly sized parcels of the same land use to provide for an equitable assessment of storm water drainage charges based on reasonably expected contribution of flows provisions need to be made to permit adjustments to the storm water drainage charge for those parcels with unique or unusual characteristics or credits to the storm water drainage charge for those parcels with storm water runoff volume andor quality treatment facilities 2grounds for adjustment athe basis of the citys storm water drainage charges is the anticipated relative contribution of storm water runoff volume and pollutant loading to the storm water drainage system from a given parcel where unique or unusual conditions exist where the actual contributions of storm water runoff volume or pollutant loading from a given parcel are substantially different from those anticipated by the storm water drainage rate structure the director of public works or designee thereof may adjust or credit the storm water drainage charge for the parcel to an appropriate level in accordance with the guidelines specified herein bthe subchapter establishing the storm water drainage utility provides for the director of public works to make adjustments or credits to the charges when 1the property owner supplies data demonstrating a storm water runoff volume for the standard rainfall event substantially different from that being used for the parcel  or 2the property owner supplies data demonstrating that storm water runoff from the parcel is being treated to provide the required removal efficiency for total suspended solids tss 3property owner to provide detailed information it is the responsibility of the property owner or agent thereof to present to the director of public works or designee thereof sufficient information concerning a parcels hydrologic characteristics to permit an accurate assessment of the conditions that exist athis information may include but is not limited to 1site plan showing locations of all buildings paved areas and other development relative to lot lines  2the total lot area and area of

land use standard where the unit runoff generated by a parcel differs from the assigned amount for that land use category by more than 20% the director of public works or designee thereof may adjust the parcels storm water drainage charge in accordance with the following procedure acalculation of unit runoff for the parcel shall be determined by the methods outlined in the natural resources conservation service technical release no 55 utilizing a oneyear event of 24hour duration as the standard rainfall event bif the calculated unit runoff is shown to differ from the assigned amount for that land use category by 20% or more the volume portion of the fee for that parcel shall be adjusted by multiplying it by the ratio of the calculated unit runoff to the standard unit runoff ca parcels storm water drainage charge shall be subject to increases as well as decreases by this procedure dfor parcels with ponds covered by public easements the area used for the calculation of the charge shall be reduced by the size of the easement area ebecause singlefamily and duplex fees are not based upon actual parcel acreage no adjustments for unit runoff differences will be made for

council finds that 1tobacco smoke is a leading cause of disease in nonsmokers and a major source of indoor air pollution secondhand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults secondhand smoke causes heart disease lung cancer respiratory infections decreased respiratory function and other health problems  2in a 2006 report of the united states surgeon general us surgeon general carmona concluded that exposure to secondhand smoke remains an alarming public health hazard and that more than 126 million nonsmokers are still exposed  3numerous nationally recognized medical and scientific authorities including the american medical association the us surgeon general the national institute on occupational safety and health the national cancer institute the environmental protection agency the national academy of sciences the national toxicology program and the world health organization have issued reports and health advisories addressing the adverse effects of exposure to secondhand smoke  4it is estimated between 24300 and 71900 low birth weight or preterm deliveries about 202300 episodes of childhood asthma new cases and exacerbations between 150000 and 300000 cases of lower respiratory illness in children and about 789700 cases of middle ear infections in children occur in the united states each year as a result of exposure to secondhand smoke  5it is estimated that in the united states secondhand smoke causes about 46000 a range of 22700 to 69600 deaths per year from cardiacrelated illnesses including 700 to 1240 deaths among minnesotans and 3400 deaths per year from lung cancer  6there is no known safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke  neither the separation of smokers and nonsmokers nor the introduction of new ventilation systems can eliminate the health hazards caused by secondhand smoke the scientific evidence indicates that there is no riskfree level of exposure to secondhand smoke eliminating smoking in indoor spaces protects nonsmokers from exposure to secondhand smoke separating smokers from nonsmokers cleaning the air or ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke the only means of effectively eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to prohibit smoking  7objective evidence does not support fears that restricting smoking in enclosed indoor areas will harm a communitys economy on the contrary many independent economic studies have shown that the elimination of smoking has no material economic impact on a community these studies have drawn from the experience of hundreds of communities that successfully eliminated smoking in workplaces and public places numerous us cities counties and states and many nations have adopted laws ending all smoking in bars restaurants and other public places  8business owners have no legal or constitutional right to expose their employees and customers to airborne toxins such as those found in secondhand smoke on the contrary employers have a common law duty to provide workers with a workplace that is not unreasonably dangerous  9restricting smoke in public places and places of work can help to model smokefree behavior and to reduce youth exposure to secondhand smoke  and 10public health policies ordinances and other laws are part of the system by which people learn behaviors guide youth reduce health threats and reinforce community norms that support the publics health baccordingly the city council finds and declares that the purpose of this subchapter is to 1protect vulnerable populations including employees children the elderly and those with chronic health conditions  2affirm that the right to breathe has priority over the desire to smoke  and 3protect the public health welfare and safety by better ensuring the ability of citizens to breathe safe and uncontaminated air 2004 20 passed 12262006  passed 12112007  11326 definitions for the purpose of this subchapter the

reference this chapter shall have no force and effect until the city council accepts these recommendations by resolution of a majority of its members using the model resolution contained in app a of ch 121 of this code asexuallyoriented businesses have an impact on the neighborhoods surrounding them which is distinct from the impact caused by other uses bresidential and commercial neighborhoods located within close proximity to sexuallyoriented businesses experience the following negative impacts 1increased crime rates particularly in sexrelated crimes such as rapes prostitution indecent exposure and other lewd and lascivious behavior  2property values which are either diminished or fail to appreciate at the rate of other comparable properties not located in proximity to sexuallyoriented businesses  3increased transiency and decreased stability of ownership  4deteriorated neighborhood appearance from litter and graffiti  5sexrelated harassment of residents and customers by motorists and pedestrians  6a perception that the area is unsafe  and 7difficulty in attracting and retaining customers employees and desirable tenants cthe adverse impacts which sexuallyoriented businesses have on surrounding areas diminish as the distance from the sexuallyoriented business increases dthe adverse impacts of sexuallyoriented businesses are exacerbated when the uses are located near each other ethe presence of liquor establishments in the immediate vicinity of sexuallyoriented businesses also compounds the adverse impacts on the neighborhood fsexuallyoriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending places of worship children attending day care centers or schools and people using public parks and libraries gsexuallyoriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area where they are located thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable and habitable housing for city residents hthe concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses in one area can have a substantially detrimental effect on that area and on the overall quality of urban life a cycle of decay can result from the influx and concentration of sexuallyoriented businesses the presence of such businesses is perceived by others as an indication that the area is deteriorating and the result can be devastating other businesses move out of the vicinity and residents flee from the area the resulting decline in real estate values erodes the citys tax base and contributes to overall urban blight ilanduse regulations are appropriate to minimize the detrimental effects that sexuallyoriented businesses have on
