 reserved article ii  curfew for minors footnotes  2  editors note  adopted dec 3 201 amended art ii in its entirety to read as herein set out former art ii  86318639 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from  adopted oct 27 2009 purpose this article sets forth regulations for the presence of minors in public places during specified times of day these regulations encompass prevailing community standards for the purpose of furthering responsible conduct and advancing family responsibility and of promoting public safety and welfare for all persons the board of commissioners has determined that a curfew meets a very real need and is a significant factor in protecting juveniles and minimizing juvenile delinquency and promoting the publics health safety and welfare the board of commissioners also finds that there are persons upon the streets of the city who represent an influence that is detrimental to the health safety welfare and morals of minors considering their peculiar vulnerability and their inability to make critical decisions in an informed and mature manner and that minors who fall under this influence in turn represent a detriment to the health safety welfare and morals of the community as a whole and lead to increased crime and fear among citizens for their safety and welfare and that of their minor children the board of commissioners also finds that commercial recreational facilities are very limited in the city the curfew hours cited by this article reflect the community standard of the appropriate hour for cessation of outdoor activities by minors in public places the curfew also takes into account the hours which present the highest risk for nocturnal crimes and for the congregating of minors with potential risks incident to immaturity therefore the board of commissioners finds that this article is necessary and that it serves the communitys interest in protecting our minors from criminal and other unhealthy influences the board of commissioners has determined that parental and community responsibility for the whereabouts of minors is a community norm as parental and community control increases the likelihood of juvenile delinquency decreases therefore legal sanctions to enforce parental and community responsibility has been shown to be significantly effective in minimizing the incidence of juvenile delinquency and in protecting the minors and the community at large the board of commissioners hereby determines that the curfew for minors will accomplish under local conditions the purposes stated herein the board of commissioners is mindful that minors in the city have the right to use the public places streets and ways to exercise their rights to free speech and association to travel to be employed and to be involved in school church and other association activities and find that any restrictions upon these rights are essential for the purposes set out herein and are limited to meeting the essential needs found herein and are otherwise scrupulously protected herein it is the desire and intent of the board of commissioners that in assessing penalties for violation of section 8633 of this article the court should utilize to the full extent of the law procedures and sentences other than monetary fines to that the minor bears the burden for violation of the ordinance rather than a parent of such minor  12313   91718 definitions when used in this article the following words and terms unless the context indicates a different meaning shall have the

development of the community and to promote the health safety and general welfare of the city ii 10191 findings and objectives a the objective of this article is to establish requirements for the installation and maintenance of landscape elements and other means of site improvement in offstreet parking areas and other developed properties the justification for such regulation is threefold 1 to aid in regulating and controlling vehicular and pedestrian circulation in parking areas  2 to enhance the communitys ecological or environmental and aesthetic qualities  and 3 to protect and conserve the value of property b the present process of development has a negative effect on the ecological balance of an area paved surfaces automobiles buildings and other improvements all produce great increases in air temperatures a problem especially noticeable in this southern region whereas plants have the opposite effect the creation of shade likewise impervious surfaces created by development generate greater water runoff causing problems from erosion and flooding this is a particular relevant concern in this city and the surrounding area due to the lack of gradient and drainage access to the ocean and the consequent need to prevent upsetting the hydrological balance that has evolved c the increased number size and complexity of offstreet parking areas serving ever larger commercial industrial and other facilities indicates a need for proper traffic control and vehicular and pedestrian movement or circulation in order to avoid a potential danger to the peoples health safety and welfare d the importance of preserving and improving the natural environment and maintaining a working ecological balance is of increasing concern the fact that the use of landscape elements can effectively aid in the air purification oxygen regeneration water absorption and noise glare and heat abatement as well as the preservation of the communitys aesthetic qualities indicates that the use of landscape elements is of benefit to the health welfare and general wellbeing of the community and therefore it is proper that the use of such element be required iii 10191 plans for buffers prior to construction of buffers as defined in section 13431 complete plans showing type of material depth of berm and structural support shall be submitted to the building permit office for analysis to determine whether or not 1 the screen will withstand the pressures of time and nature  2 the screen adequately accomplishes the purpose for which it was intended iva2 10191 required landscape installation a objectives in addition to those objectives stated in section 13433 the purpose of this section is to ensure the placement of landscape elements within offstreet paved surface areas so as to 1 channel vehicular and pedestrian movement within offstreet paved ground surface areas into safer and more logical patterns  2 ensure that the offstreet paved ground area and the adjacent rightofway are clearly and visually delineated  3 ensure that physical access between each is effectively limited to established points of ingress and egress  4 ensure that those established and acceptable ingress and egress points are clearly delineated  5 ensure that noise glare and other distractions of movement within one area do not adversely affect activity within adjacent properties  and 6 regenerate oxygen and reduce heat glare water runoff and other conditions concomitant with the construction of expanses of buildings or pavement within the parcel b requirements the amount of landscaping required for street yards per zone shall be as follows 1 twofamily residential 15 percent of street yard 2 medium density multifamily r3 15 percent of street yard 3 highdensity multifamily r4 15 percent of street yard 4 officeprofessional op 15 percent of street yard 5 neighborhood commercial nc 15 percent of street yard 6 general business c 15 percent of street yard 7 central business district c2 zero percent 8 heavy commercial hc 15 percent of street yard 9 limited industrial li 15 percent of street yard 10 heavy industrial hi 15 percent of street yard c credit for trees whereas trees contribute greatly to the quality of the communitys environment dioxide absorption and oxygen generation air purification by precipitation of dust particles transpiration reduction of heat by transpiration and the creation of shade and to the improvement of the communitys aesthetic qualities  and whereas the extent of the above positive contributions are a function of the size of the tree rather than of the size of the planting area in which the tree is planted  therefore in recognition of the contributions made by trees to the objectives of this article credit shall be given for each tree in accordance with the following schedule 1 trees which are newly planted shall receive credit against the landscape area requirements according to the following schedule a large trees 1 greater than 12inch caliber 200 square feet 2 greater than sixinch caliber 100 square feet b medium trees between threeinch to sixinch caliber 50 square feet the term caliber means the average diameter of the trees measured four feet above ground level 2 in order to encourage the preservation of trees that are already established and growing an additional credit of 100 square feet shall be given to existing trees that are preserved rather than cut 3 the credits permitted under this subsection c shall apply where the tree is in a planting area as required by this article and whose least dimension is onehalf the radius of the crown spread of the tree measured from the trunk center in no case shall this least dimension be less than a radius of 212 feet measured from the center of the tree trunk to the near edge of the landscape area the ground surface within such preserved planting areas shall be maintained in a porous or vegetative cover credit allowed for trees shall be in addition to the actual square footage of planting area within which the tree is located d location of landscaped area landscaped area as required in subsection b of this section must be provided along the street yard of each lot corner lots and other lots abutting two or more streets must landscape the street yard for each street see illustrations attached to designated as attachment 1 thereto illustration nos 1   the illustrations are intended to show in pictorial form the requirements of this article v 10191 applicability to new and existing developed areas a new development or redevelopment 1 the requirements and standards for the installation and maintenance of landscape elements and site improvements as set forth in this article shall apply to all developed areas within the city 2 if the zoning ordinance of the city would otherwise permit in excess of 85 percent total land coverage by building development the provisions of this article shall supersede and prevail over such other

for higher density apartment complexes including highrise apartments and complexes with a number of buildings on the same tract of land 2 this is a zone for areas that have large unbroken tracts of land suitable for development as large complexes it is not intended for areas already subdivided into lots and it is anticipated that developments in this zone will have to plat the property as a whole as part of the development process 3 traditional area requirements are inappropriate for this district so setbacks from lot lines are minimal and there are no restrictions as to the number of residential buildings that may be placed on a lot height limitations are also relaxed except when abutting singlefamily uses more reliance is placed on square footage per dwelling unit lot coverage open space and parking ratios to control density thereby allowing more flexibility in the design of such projects 4 this zone allows higher density developments and should be located where internal streets are wider than singlefamily sized streets and where there is increased water capacity fire protection wastewater and drainage capacity adequate open space should be within walking distance approximately onefourth mile areas should not be zoned to this usage unless they are located on or close to arterials or collectors capable of carrying the additional traffic they will generate the traffic generated by such uses should not travel density residential areas 5 higher density multifamily developments are not a buffer between singlefamily and commercial uses and should be properly buffered from nonresidential uses and protected from high volumes of nonresidential traffic or from pollution andor environmental hazards b permitted uses 1 one singlefamily detached dwelling per lot

an alley in an r4 district reserved rmh mobile home district a purpose 1 the rmh mobile home district is established to provide adequate space and site diversification for mobile home parks and subdivisions the city recognizes that the mobile home is a viable alternative to the typical singlefamily residence and will not discriminate against mobile homes 2 mobile homes are typically built outside the city limits of pharr and do not meet the same building code requirements as the singlefamily structure mobile home parks or subdivisions will therefore be allowed to locate near other residential neighborhoods but individual mobile homes will not be allowed on lots within other residentialtype neighborhoods 3 mobile home lots have different area requirements than spaces in a mobile home park in addition mobile home subdivisions have public streets and utilities built to city standards whereas mobile home parks do not while mobile home parks and subdivisions fall under the same zoning category a mobile home park will not be allowed to convert to a subdivision until the area requirements of a mobile home subdivision have been met the requirements of the subdivision ordinance have been met and a plat has been approved 4 unlike the other districts the city will not zone areas for mobile home usage in advance unless asked to do so by the property owners this district could therefore be considered a floating zone and must be rezoned to this use care must be taken to ensure that the needs for areas zoned for mobile homes are met and that this form of housing is not discriminated against in the rezoning process 5 mobile home developments are a low to mediumdensity use and have the same additional requirements for streets water fire protection wastewater drainage and open space as townhouse and duplexes 6 mobile home developments are not a buffer between singlefamily and commercial uses and should be properly buffered from nonresidential uses and protected from high volumes of nonsinglefamily traffic or from pollution andor environmental hazards when properly buffered a mobile home park should not have an adverse impact on adjacent residential areas or their property values 7 an rmh district shall not be permitted in the city of pharr texas after the effective date of amendatory  notwithstanding any other provision in this section mobile homes shall

major thoroughfare when developed in accordance with the comprehensive plan uses in this district may also be located on streets with potential congestion problems 4 the lowintensity commercial uses allowed in this district are still more intensive than nearly all types of residential developments areas should not be zoned to this usage unless they are located on or close to arterials or collectors capable of carrying the additional traffic they will generate and where there is increased water fire protection wastewater and drainage capacity although such uses may locate adjacent to residential areas they still must be buffered and landscaped to protect such adjacent areas the traffic from such uses should not travel any long distances over residential sized streets or areas 5 in order to encourage a high standard of office development and to make sure such uses are compatible with adjacent residential districts the area requirements are more restrictive than for office

motions are usually classified in several ways 1 main motion  2 subsidiary motionundebatable motions  3 privileged motions  and 4 fullydebatable motions a main motion is a motion that brings business before the board main motions are made while no other motion is pending any of the subsidiary or privileged motions may be made while the main motion is pending and in many cases these motions if passed will affect the boards consideration of the main motion a subsidiary or undebatable motion is a type of motion by which a deliberative assembly deals directly with a main motion prior to or instead of voting on the main motion itself subsidiary motions are motions such as to postpone indefinitely amend and to table subsidiary or undebatable motions involve procedural questions that can be resolved without discussion such as tabling a main motion moving the previous question restricting further discussion of a main motion to a fixed number of minutes postponing action or referring an item under discussion to a committee after a subsidiary or undebatable motion is offered the chairman must immediately take a vote without discussion privileged motions grant precedence over ordinary business such motions have limited debate permitted they include setting the time of the next meeting adjourn recess or executive session any discussion of a privileged motion must be addressed to the motion itself a motion to fix the time for adjourning the commission meeting for example might require limited debate as to the advisability of such a decision but other points of discussion would be out of order fullydebatable motions are subject to unlimited discussion prior to a decision one of the most important principles of debate is that board members statements be directly relevant to the item under consideration board members recognized by the chairman are given the floor only for the purpose of discussing the item then pending and they are out of order if they depart from that item debate can easily evolve into statements of personal philosophy interesting though they may seem to the speaker such departures do not belong in a commission meeting committeesworking groups
