significant amount of research discussion writing and review by a seven member subcommittee of the hollis historic district commission hoc the members of this committee are all residents of hollis and have professional or avocational backgrounds in the fields of building design construction real estate historic preservation writing landscape design and history in addition to studying the specific architecture and history of hollis the committee studied the guidelines and regulations of nine other towns in new hampshire and massachusetts in developing these guidelines and regulations for hollis in 1971 the citizens of hollis voted to create the historic district to safeguard our towns heritage these regulations are intended to help the residents of the district and the members of the hoc preserve the visual qualities of the district in a fair and consistent manner we have included background information on the history of hollis as well as descriptive details illustrating the various architectural styles evident in the district it is our belief that with a greater understanding of the principles of design incorporated in the better preserved buildings in the district more informed design decisions will be made as the buildings of the district are repaired modified or new buildings erected while these design guidelines and regulations are to be fairly applied there is sufficient latitude given in the section on enforcement and waivers to allow the members of the hdc discretion when conditions warrant the past two and a half centuries have sewn hollis together as a comfortable quilt made up of our individual patches of property with good guidelines reasonable regulations and rational discussion we are confident this quilt will provide satisfaction to the owners of those distinctive patches and the community as a whole the members of the sub committee have enjoyed this opportunity to serve the town and look forward to enjoying the very tangible benefits of this document miriam gillitt winer cochair van eresian kevin mcdonnell marty valicenti jim cram cochair jerry walsh marilyn wehrle sharon howe liaison to historical society    history of hollis in january of 173 capt peter powers of dunstable massachusetts crossed the nashaway river with his young wife and two small children and traveled ten miles into the wilderness to a small cabin that he had built on land deeded to him by the proprietors of old dunstable in the province of massachusetts peter and his family thus became the first settlers of the town we now know as hollis peter powers little cabin was located just northwest of the present day four comers behind the house that stands at 8 silver lake road  over the next ten years a number of settlers came to this area to establish homesteads and raise families in 1740 abraham taylor gave a portion of the land from his grant to the town on which to establish the first meeting house and provide for the burial ground and the training field before the first meetinghouse was built the placement of the boundary line between the provinces of new hampshire and massachusetts which had been the subject of protracted and acrimonious controversy was finally established and the people living north of our current state border found themselves in new hampshire not massachusetts although this was a difficult circumstance for many they persisted in their efforts to settle the town and comply with the laws in respect to the support of the ministry and the erection of a church finally the first meetinghouse was built in 1743 on land where the present church now stands and the location of holles centre was established on  the town charter was signed by governor benning wentworth of new hampshire and the land which was called nissitisset by native americans and old dunstable and the parish of west dunstable by the early settlers was for a time known as holles named after thomas pelham holles the duke of newcastle to whom the governor owed his position the first town election was held  and the number of names on the first tax list for that year was fiftythree over the next several decades the town grew rapidly the natural resources of hollis made it favorable for farming with rich soils in the center of town and many ponds and streams to provide water for the first 200 years most of the householders of the town were farmers with numbers of traders innkeepers blacksmiths carpenters shoemakers and other mechanics to serve their needs the abundance of forests also provided material for the coopering trade which was carried on by farmers during the winter months the stands of timber along with the rivers and streams furnished suitable mill sites and saw mills also became a significant local industry 7 as the 18th century progressed the tiny log houses of the first settlers were replaced by larger and more substantial buildings using lumber from the nearby mills in the census taken in 178 there were listed 1392 inhabitants 174 dwellinghouses and 144 barns by 1800 the population reached its pretwentieth century peak of 1557 inhabitants in 1820 there were five grain mills six saw mills one clothing mill one carding machine one tannery two taverns and four stores during the nineteenth century the tide turnedwith the population gradually decreasing many of hollis young folks chose to relocate either to the cities or the lands to the west which were being opened up to new settlement however the town center remained a strong focus of community life the always ready engine house was built in 185 the high school in 187 the town hall in 1886 and many of the houses in the center of town were refurbished or rebuilt in the modern styles of the day the fact that the railroad never came into town helped hollis retain its rural character in that industry which might have flourished here never developed because of the difficulties of transportation by 1902 the population had dropped to 910 inhabitants for the first half of this century although the population again began to increase hollis continued to be a quiet farming community automobiles made transportation easier for those who had jobs or markets in nearby towns or cities during the summer months tourists and guests desirous of spending pleasant days in the country were welcomed at a number of homes throughout the town this idyllic period was not to last the past 30 years have seen a dramatic increase in residential development farms are disappearing and the face of the landscape is rapidly changing what can we do to preserve the quiet country charm and rural atmosphere that many of us remember and most of us desire the first step was made in 1971 when the town approved an an historic district in the town center and appointing members to an historic district commission 0 what is an historic district an historic district is an area in a community which townspeople have voted to designate as special because of its significance and place in american history by doing so cities and towns create a comprehensive mechanism for protecting historic structures and areas the goal of the commission is to preserve the structures and places of historic and architectural value in the historic district so as to safeguard the heritage of the town  and to set up clear and objective rules so that decisions and permits are not based on the personal tastes and preferences of the commission members reviewing proposals for change in new hampshire the establishment of historic districts is authorized by state legislation rsa   the purpose of this legislation is to preserve and safeguard aesthetic cultural and historical features of the district which may be threatened with extinction like zoning an historic district overlay zone is a legal entity that helps preserve and protect property values and the character of a neighborhood the districts purpose is to safeguard the heritage of the center of hollis by a preserving a district which reflects elements of its cultural social economic political and architectural history  b conserving property values in such district   c fostering civic beauty   d strengthening the local economy and  e promoting the use of an historic district for the education pleasure and welfare of the citizens rsa  under the terms of the the commission is authorized to regulate the construction alteration painting moving demolition or use of structures and places within the historic district it does this by requiring property owners to apply for approval when they wish to make an exterior change to existing buildings iand and uses within the boundaries of the district the intent of the not to freeze the historic district into any one period or to prevent future change much of its charm and character is derived from its evolution over more than two centuries and what the various buildings convey about changing life styles owners and uses its purpose is however to ensure that the changes that occur in the district are compatible with the surrounding historic environment  the buildings sites and overall setting benefits of the historic district include a public recognition of the importance of hollis heritage one that is shared not just by those residing within the district but by the entire community  a stabilizing effect on property values  and the economic benefits of drawing visitors to the area therefore the hdc will adhere to the goals and spirit of the towns master plan 9 architectural styles the architecture of hollis represents almost all periods of our towns history in order to appreciate our architectural history we need to understand and recognize what we have the following three terms will help us identify what is involved when we discuss our architectural heritage a building type b architectural style c period architecture a the building type or form refers to the shape and massing of a particular structure see drawings at end of booklet for example 1 the term hall and parlor house refers to a type of house that is two rooms units wide one room deep and one story high this is a linear shape or form 2 the i house refers to a type that is two rooms wide one room deep and two stories high this is also a linear form 3 the cape cod house is two rooms wide two rooms deep and one story high this is called a massed plan 4 the salt box is one or two rooms deep one or two rooms high in front with a sloping roof which covers a rear addition that is not as high as the front 5 the box house is a massed plan two or more rooms wide two rooms deep and two rooms high 6 the four square is a massed plan two or more rooms wide two rooms deep and two rooms high with a pyramidal roof b the style of a building consists of the way certain architectural details and design characteristics are applied to a building type the style is derived from the application of design concepts such as massing scale proportion and symmetry it also derives from the nature of the design elements  the building materials shapes color ornamentthe architectural details themselves these architectural details could theoretically be applied to any type of building the style can be thought of as the clothing of the building c the period represents the time frame during which the building was constructed when you hear the words period building whether it be georgian federal or greek revival it simply means that the building would have been built during that particular period of time when the style was first in vogue for example for a building to be of true georgian period and style it would have to exhibit the particular design characteristics of the georgian style and also to have been built during the georgian period  that is from about 1720 to 1780 10 the colonial period 1730  1780 the colonial period in hollis covered the time from the first settlement in 1731 up time of the american revolution the colonial style if you can call it that persisted well into the 1800s actually the term colonial style reflects a building which is really lacking in style or fancy ornamentation these early buildings were out of necessity modest in scale and elaboration and generally exhibited the following characteristics  one or two stories high oriented toward the south gable ends  steeply pitched roof with large centrally located chimney  timber framed covered in split shingles or clapboards  exteriors unadorned  eaves close to the windows  windows double hung with 9 or 12 small lights and wide muntin bars  hand forged iron for hinges handles and nails  may show an incremental process of construction over an extended period of time  later 18th century models may exhibit lower roof slope regularly placed and proportionately larger door and window openings paneled doors and shutters transom light above the door and gabled dormer windows but still the absence of ornamentation was evident  buildings would have been left unpainted to weather to a browngray color rather than painted in colonial times after paint was introduced colors would have been limited to earth tones examples of colonial architecture in the hollis historic district include the first parsonage now called the meetinghouse on the corner of cleasby lane and monument square the worcester house on the corner of depot road and richardson road the emerson house at 5 broad street each of these buildings exhibits a very plain exterior even with subsequent alterations and additions the original colonial fabric of the building is very much evident the emerson house 11 the georgian period 1720 1780 the georgian style as opposed to the colonial is essentially a high style tradition american georgian buildings were based on english precedents that reflected formal designs adapted from the ancient classical orders of the romans this building would typically exhibit  symmetrical facade bays evenly spaced 5 bays are typical  box type building with a blocky solid appearance square shape  roofs in hollis typically hipped or gambrel  roof pitch slightly lower may have a large central chimney or two chimneys which have moved out toward the end walls  eaves had classical cornices often with modillions  clapboards were narrower than colonial clapboards  windows aligned capped with classical crown moldings or cornices  emphasis on the entrance distinctive paneled front door accentuated by pilasters and capped by a pedimented entablature  brass hardware became more common  upper windows set just below the eaves same size as lower windows  12 over 12 or 9 over 12 divided lights small panes of glass with thick mun tins  neither louvered blinds nor shutters were evident until late in the 18th century a transom light either rectangular or half round was common  covered porches at the front door were not common  buildings would have been left unpainted to weather to a browngray color in this time period paint colors could have been cheerful tones of blue green salmon or yellow or darker colonial colors examples of georgian architecture in the hollis historic district include the poole house at 19 main street built in 187 the samuel cumings house at 27 main street and the rev eli smith house on monument square opposite the church built ca17941800 the rev eli smith house 1 the federal period 1780  1820 the federal style exhibits a continuing progression based on the earlier georgian style and marks the end of a long evolution in architectural development federal houses exhibited a very rigid symmetry with strong emphasis on the front entrance and windows evenly spaced across the front facade the federal style appears lighter in its massing and more delicate in its details more refined and sophisticated features of this style include  gable or hip roofs common  with a lower pitch  chimneys moved out toward the exterior end walls  four chimneys may be evident cornice embellished by decorative moldings called dentils  doorways were emphasized but exhibited less wood than georgian columns and pilasters were slim and light  door surrounds often had semicircular fanlights and sidelights and transoms but a distinctive feature was the elliptical fanlight with delicate tracery in lead or wood  hardware became more delicate of brass and iron  six or eight panel doors looked flatter than the georgian counterparts  palladian windows three part with an arched center section were common  windows floorlength double or triplesash larger panels of glass thinner muntins six over six windows were common after 1800  decorative motifs included swags garlands urns  even fence and rail in wood and iron were used as decorative features  buildings often included curving or multisided bays elliptical rooms semicircular or octagonal bays or porticoes domed and arched ceilings  federal buildings were often built of brick if sheathed in clapboards they would be painted in white or pastel colors examples of federal architecture in the hollis historic district include the little mansion at 38 main street built in 180 the parsonage at 33 main street built in 1811 and the gatehouse at 25 broad street that has a fine example of an elliptical fanlight with sidelights and tracery at the front door and was built in 1830 the little mansion 13 the greek revival 1825  1860 the greek revival style also known as the nationalstyle was the first national fad to sweep across the newly independent united states it was the dominant style for domestic architecture for the first half of the 19th century and has never completely disappeared it is based on the classical models of greek architecture which exhibited a series of columns supporting a triangular pediment reminiscent of the greek temple the innovation of this style was to tum the gable end of the building to face the street and place the entrance off to one side this was usually represented by a threebay facade other features of the greek revival style include  gable roofs with a lower pitch some roofs were almost flat  small chimneys since heating was now done by stoves and furnaces  pedimented gables with heavy entablature including the cornice frieze and architrave were found on the roofs of buildings and porches  these wide bands of trim were almost universal widened comer boards or pilasters at the corners of the building  one story high porch supported by columns  doors usually had four panels and included rectangular transom lights and sidelights  doors recessed a foot or two behind the front wall of the building  windows six over six and later two over two  headcasings or pediments on windows often exhibited a lowpitched triangular shape  greek revival buildings were almost always painted white a symbol of purity and shutters when present were painted dark green  this combination became so popular that even colonial buildings were painted white  the roofs were typically standing seam metal which was painted either red or green  other suitable colors for the body of the building would include pale yellow light gray or sandstone  trim colors include cool white dark green and sandstone  door colors are dark green medium blue or black examples of greek revival architecture in the hollis historic district include the always ready engine house on main street built in 185 the stickney house at 4 broad street built about 184 the hardy house  brookdale farms at 36 broad street built in 184 and buttonwood farm 43 45 main street remodeled after 1849 14 the always ready engine house gothic revivalcarpenter gothic 1840 1880 the gothic revival style was seen as a christian style it was felt that if one lived in a gothic that is a christian style building it would be conducive to leading a moral life characteristics which distinguish the gothic revival style include  a rertical axis the tendency to direct the eye upward although typically american gothic buildings were but one and a half or two stories high roofs were steep with cross gables and gingerbread or elaborately shaped wooden decorative elements sawn into the vergeboards or bargeboards outline the v shape of the gable front  wall surface material extended up into the gable without a break vertical siding  single stmy porches were common supported by flattened gothic arches  verandas and balconies were embellished with brackets and decorative gothic detailing  the floor plan was asymmetrical with an lshaped plan  windows were usually two over two but sometimes had diamond shaped panes  bay windows were common  windows often extended into gables and frequently had a window crown or dripmold either in a square or gothic arch shape extending partway down the sides of the window frame  most buildings had at least one window with gothic detailing  e~tical siding painted in earthy tones of brown beige or even pink  trrm m shades of brown and doors in dark red brown or green i examples of gothic revival architecture in the hollis historic district include 4 silver lake road built in 186 once known as the gingerbread house all traces of the carpenter gothic ornament have been removed however the steeply pitched cross gables widely overhanging eaves which could support bargeboards the flattened arches connecting the porch supports and the placement of the front door tucked right against the comer of the intersecting ell wall are typical of a gothic cottage there are traces of gothic elements in a number of other buildings in town 4 silver lake road 1998 1 <  italianate 1840  1885 the italianate style was very popular during the 1850s and the 1860s the decorative brackets that adorn the eaves of the italianate building immediately identify the style thus the name american bracket style in fact brackets and verandas were often added to older farmhouses to give them a stylish uplift identifying features include  houses of wood two or three stories high most with a symmetrical facade but others had asymmetrical features with towers ells bay windows balustraded balconies and verandas  almost all had porches often with square porch supports with beveled corners  lowpitched roof with a broad overhang supported by brackets mounted either singly or in pairs  many had square towers or cupolas  windows were tall and narrow often with arched or curved tops and carved or molded window crowns  the sashes were usually two over two  bay windows common as were adjacent pairs of rectangular or roundheaded windows  double entrance doors common and for the first time glass was incorporated into the door itself rather than in a transom or side lights  exteriors were painted warm light colors of brown gray or green with contrasting trim and dark doors local examples include the victorian building at 35 main street which was built about 187879 other buildings in town that exhibit details of the bracket style include buttonwood farm 4345 main street 71 dep it road corner of merrill lane and 4 lund lane lund and silver lake road  the sau building 35main queen anne 1880  1910 the queen anne style was exuberant characterized by a variety of shapes and textures and asymmetrical massing wall surfaces were used as primary decorative elements  plain flat walls were avoided and combinations of different textured wall materials were used shingle above clapboard or above brick towers were often placed at a front facade corner buildings were polychrome painted with numerous combinations of bold colors identifying features of the queen anne style include  steeply pitched roofs highly irregular with a complex blend of roof lines dormers gables turrets and tall multiple chimney with panels  large central hipped roof with a dominant frontfacing gable  each side of the building will present a different combination of features many devices were used to avoid a smoothwalled appearance eg cutaway bays balconies verandas and towers  the vertical wall surfaces were divided into horizontal bands by using various siding materials  stone brick clapboards and patterned shingles in various combinations  walls were painted with bold colors to emphasize the patterns  windows varied greatly palladian doublehung round or round headed some with one large pane of glass w1der or surrounded by smaller colored panes  doors were generally single often with stained glass set into them  decorative detailing called spindlework or gingerbread was freely applied including turned porch supports and porch balustrades frieze bands at the porch roof spandrels and knoblike beads  building components which were used on queen anne buildings such as knee braces brackets and spindle~ were sold by mailorder companies and were shipped across the country to embellish older vernacular buildings examples of the queen anne style include elements of the town hall and 1 depot road the town hall 17 shingle style 1880  1900 the shingle style does not emphasize decorative detailing instead it displays a complex roof shape within a smooth wall surface which unifies the irregular outline of the building identifying features include  wall cladding and roofing of continuous wood shingles although the shingles may occur on the second story only  shingles continue around the walls without interruption no corner boards  asymmetrical facade with irregular steeply pitched roof line roofs usually have intersecting crossgables and multilevel eaves  extensive porches were common  towers appear as partial bulges or half towers  porch supports are either slender unadorned wooden posts or massive piers of stone or shingle cladding  generally porches were located under the main roof line  romanesque arches may be used on porches or windows  eyebrow windows and wavy wall surfaces were also used examples of the shingle style in hollis are 1 depot road seep 18  this building originally showed strong characteristics of the shingle style with some elements of the queen anne and 91 worcester road the building at 77 broad street also had elements of the shingle style at the turn of the century folk victorian 1870 1910 this style is characterized by an overall simplicity of form decorative treatment is usually confined to porch trim in the form of turned spindles and lacelike spandrels or flat jigsaw cut trim sometimes with gable trim and brackets under the eaves window surrounds may have a simple pediment above  door hoods and brackets were common these decorative details were less elaborate and extensive than on the styles they were imitating and were applied to the common folk building forms existing or being built at the time the gable front and wing with a centered gable in the wing is a common form in hollis 16 broad street 18 examples of folk victorian style in the district include 16 broad street 30 ash street 15 main street 17 main street 18 main street 1

preserve the visual qualities of the district in a fair and consistent manner waivers the commission shall have the discretion to waive any condition contained in these regulations for good cause shown a waiver of these regulations will be granted if each of the following conditions is found l no decrease in value of surrounding properties would be suffered 2 granting the waiver would benefit the public interest 3 by granting the waiver substantial justice would be done 4 granting the waiver would not be contrary to the spirit and intent of the regulations 5 granting the waiver would not be detrimental to the character environment scenic value or general welfare of the town building exterior hollis historic district is comprised of buildings that span the time from 1744 to the present day each building is distinctly different and conveys both its own history and a piece of the story of hollis similarly alterations to a single building impact not only the architectural character of that structure but the overall character and integrity of the entire district walls and trim the buildings in the hollis historic district are defined in large part by the prevalence of wood used for clapboards shingles and trim to retain this character it is critical that painted wooden clapboards which match those existing in terms of exposed width continue to be the material used when replacing deteriorated clapboard siding these details must be consistent  however alternative siding such as vinyl may be considered at the boards discretion but in all cases extreme attention will be given to the trim details around windows and doors and at the comers facia and eaves these details must be consistent with the architectural style of the building attention shall be paid on older buildings to possible serious moisture problems in covering old clapboards with alternative siding wooden shingles or clapboards shiplap and board and batten are suitable exterior coverings for outbuildings  in general the existing material shall be matched in kind exterior trim such as cornerboards door and window casings cornices and door and gable pediments play a critical role in the appearance and proportions of a building all trim that contributes to the historic character of a building shall be retained and preserved when it is necessary to replace all or portions of such features they shall be replaced to match that which has been removed in terms of material design and placement as much of the original feature as possible shall be repaired rather than replaced if using the same kind of material is not technically feasible a compatible material may be considered it is not appropriate to install trim that relates to an earlier period or different style than the building see architectural style section painting and color when planning a paint job it is usually r iecessary to remove only the damaged or deteriorated paint to the next layer handscraping or hand sanding are the preferred methods to avoid damaging the woodwork heatguns hotair guns or chemical strippers can be used to remove paint when entire layers are so deteriorated that total removal is necessary for adhesion sandblasting waterblasting or using torches is not recommended as they can cause irreversible damage the colors shall be appropriate for the buildings style taking into account that the original style may have been modified in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century and that those alterations are an integral part of the buildings history a color guide for historical buildings is available from the commission color is regulated by the hdc and applicants are required to register their color choices the commission asks that owners respect the various color schemes used for buildings in the district and consult the painting guidelines available at the hdc reference library the pratt and lambert color guide for historical homes one of several commercial color guides showing historical colors and the old house journal guide to restoration showing appropriate colors for given periods and styles including stains for colonial may be used in the building inspectors office where they are housed with the hdc reference library see also comments on paint color in architectural styles section 21 entry way trim colonial federal greek revival american bracket roofs roofs are an important design element of historic buildings the shape of an existing historic roof shall not be altered the color type and size of any new roofing material needs to be approved by the commission wooden shingles are the most historically appropriate for rural eighteenth and nineteenth century buildings and the texture variegated color and warmth afforded by wood has special appeal if asphalt shingles are selected a dark color is preferable asphalt architectural shingles that imitate wooden shingles and slate are available from most roofing companies repairs to existing slate roofs shall be made prior to replacing the entire roof  frequently the problems on such roofs lie in flashing or substrates rather than the slates themselves snow belts are allowable but shall be copper preferable or a dark anodized aluminum for minimal impact skylights that are visible from the public way are not desireable low profile skylights may be approved if they do not interrupt a significant roofline in lieu of skylights small gabled or shedred dormers might be more appropriate chimneys are also an important feature of historic buildings and shall be retained chimneys in poor condition shall be rebuilt rather than removed if a missing chimney is to be rebuilt the reconstructed feature shall be appropriately sized positioned and constructed to appear historically functional historic photographs might assist in the design if a new chimney is to be built it shall be masonry and situated in a location appropriate to the historic design and function of the building television antennae satellite dishes solar collectors and other objects affixed to the roof shall be installed on the rear or a minimally visible slope of a roof and be of the smallest size practical the visual impact of electrical wires and meters shall be minimized where possible wires shall be buried for weather as well as aesthetics meters shall not be placed on the primary fai ade of a building but shall be located so as not to limit access by public service personnel 22 low shed dormer on greek rev windows and blinds the replacement windows on the first floor of this building with their strong horizontal lines are at odds with the historic vertical proportions established by the original window openings above photo jaffrey windows like trim details are an essential part of the design of any building most of the windows in the historic district buildings are regularly spaced and of similar size the sash is nearly universally double hung with a wide range of lights depending on the style and period replacement windows shall follow the buildings historic fenestration pattern including opening size placement type of sash and generous muntin profile replacement lights shall not be smaller or of an earlier period than is appropriate for the building it should be noted that small paned windows were often replaced in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with 2 over 2 or 2 over 1 sash in such cases reverting to smaller paned sash is neither necessary nor always recommended in the course of restoring a building historic photographs available at the historical society and sociallibrary are helpful in determining the appearance of historic sash and at what date replacement sash was installed snapin interior muntins are not recommended unless paired with exterior mun tins when remodeling an historically significant building exterior storm windows are appropriate for historic buildings but their meeting rails shall line up with the primary sash and the tops match the shape of the primary sash storms shall be painted the color of the primary sash  if a factory finish is used its color shall approximate the color of the primary sash window air conditioners are allowed preferably in an inconspicuous location and preferably removed on a seasonal basis if authentic exterior wood blinds shutters have remained with the building they shall be maintained and used exterior blinds of metal or synthetic materials are not recommended as substitutes since they are often not sized properly and their appearance is not authentic 23      ~1itl~~~~~

building the scale size and materials of the addition shall neither overwhelm the historic building nor obscure its significant historic materials and features additions shall be placed onto secondary elevations  the preferred choice is usually on the rear or an inconspicuous side if the buildings consist of a main house an ell and an attached barn the proportional relationship shall not be lost in the course of building an addition generally the addition should not try to mimic the historic building but should reflect it in terms of scale massing and overall proportions a traditional design and traditional materials will usually be most suitable within the hollis historic district roof shapes height materials fenestration and doors are key design issues they shall 24 be compatible with the historic building and any previous addition moldings and other details might be simplified in the addition both to make clear a distinction between the old and new and to keep the addition secondary

in other sections of these regulations the hollis historic district is an area which the townspeople have voted to designate as being unique because of its significance and place in american history considerable detail has been provided to guide property owners with the ongoing maintenance and upgrading of their houses and buildings in a manner that will preserve and safeguard aesthetic cultural and historic features of the the district new buildings in the district are to be held to the standards of changes to existing buildings new buildings face the additional challenge of having to minimize the impact they will make by reducing portions of open space which is a valued asset of any community it is expected that all new buildings in the historic district will respect the fact that hollis is a rural community whose architecture consists primarily of traditional shapes and that new structures will fit comfortably with these existing structures stylistic elements on new construction which do not relate to existing elements on historic buildings in the bistrict shall generally be disallowed all new construction within the historic district shall be designed with the goal of enhancing the appearance of existing buildings by being consistent with the those buildings in terms of rhythm siting scale architectural features and materials the rich and varied styles and configurations of the existing buildings in the historic district give the modern designer significant latitude to satisfy the requirements of both the new owner and the historic district siting new structures shall be located so as to be consistent with the set back of the buildings nearest to them thereby preserving the views up and down the street with a consistent facade of building fronts in order to accomplish this the hdc may recommend that the zba allow variances to the town regulated front setback requirements scale new structures shall be in harmony with the mass scale and proportion of adjacent buildings architectural features new structures shall not introduce architectural features that are inconsistent with other buildings in the area the shape of the building pitch of the roof size of dormers presentation of gables to or away from the street must be appropriate to the architectural styles nearby r windows and doors the size shape and frequency of these openings shall

scattered deciduous trees shrubs or agricultural fields examples are town owned property on depot road and the front of the new high school to the swale any area noted in the master plans as scenic should be maintained as is the commission asks that property owners consider siting a new building or additions so that existing vistas are maintained when possible view richardson and depot road to

fences and lawns the massing of the buildings is similar one to another even though the styles and dates of construction are different there are glimpses to fields and other town streets this is the streetscape rhythm and flow which is to be retained in a rural village this rhythm flow and balance of mass with 29 open space is to be preserved and not interrupted with unusual amounts of blacktop gaps of deep setbacks without a flow of fencing shrubs or trees to carry the eye to the next building or interrupted or blocked by disproportionately large or tall objects or structures a typical

glossary  adapted from koetter and kim architecture dictionary  design principles size things are large or small in relative terms in relation to both the human body and other things absolute size is sually less important than relative size scale term widely used in design and architecture to describe a rather subtle consideration related to size it refers to the proper proportion of an object or space to all otl1er objects to human beings and to the space to which it belongs good scale is achieved by choosing elements that seem to be of an appropriate size for the space t11ey will inhabit good scale is indicated when things look so right that the issue does not even come to mind  proportion addresses the relationship of parts of a design to each other and to the whole good proportion is considered a key requirement in any aesthetic success achieving good proportions is less easy than recognizing them although many efforts have been made to develop systems for doing so one approach using mathematical relationships analogous to the rules of harmony in music suggests organizing proportions according to geometric ratios of simple whole numbers such as  and   and  many architects including palladio based their structures on such systems other approaches such as the modular of lecorbusier base dimensional units on human body proportions and extend these multiplication into a system the modular also makes use of a particular mathematical relationship often referred to as the golden ratio or golden  and designated by the greek letter phi it has had much 47 influence on design throughout history the terms  golden mean golden ratio and golden section all refer to a proportional relationship that satisfies a certain requirement with a high level of occurrence in nature the proportion of the golden  or approximately  balance concerns the achievement of a state of equilibrium between forces balanced relationships look normal at rest and comfortable unbalanced relationships are tenuous and disturbing rhythm a concept borrowed from music rhythm relates visual elements together in a regular pattern it can be achieved by repetition the use of rhythm  the choice of small or large units close together or widely spaced  should be appropriate to the situation since repetition can lead to monotony it must also be balanced against the need for variety harmony describes the combination of elements and other principles in a way that produces consonance in order to achieve harmony all the varied components like the notes in a chord must relate to each other and to the overall theme of the design unity allows the viewer to experience a design as a whole rather than seeing it as a collection of elements all the parts of the design will relate so well that they create a unit in which ideally nothing can be added taken away or altered without changing the totality variety variety and contrast the countervailing qualities to harmony and unity can relieve monotony giving the eye a number of different shapes textures colors or details to look at contrast heightens values a light color will seem lighter if placed near a dark color a large object larger in contrast with something small in this context contrast and variety may be viewed as ways to punctuate harmony and unity heightening the spaces overall impact emphasis ensures that important element look important while minor and trivial elements look subordinate this is achieved size placement value color and selection of materials a large door centrally placed becomes a point of focus a brightly colored object in an otherwise quiet space calls attention to itself  design elements space something we cannot touch but it inevitably is felt  we are within and surrounded by space and therefore a part of it point in geometry the point is simply a location in space  two points suggest a beginning and an end and lead to the idea of a connecting line line when a point moves or when two points are connected line is generated  may be straight or curved has length but not breadth  vertical suggest stability  and by extension dignity and permanence  horizontal suggest rest repose  diagonal suggest movementdynamic forces and activity shape twodimensional connection of lines triangles squares curvilinear form threedimensional connection of lines pyramids cylinders etc 48 colorhue  red yellow green blue etc color saturation or intensity refers to the degree of pureness of the hue  from very pure to very grayed  hue  is also modified by chroma intensity or brilliance and value value the amount of lightness or darkness white is light and black is dark when you compare white and gray the gray is of darker value than the white when you compare gray to black the gray is of lighter value than black texture surface quality how something feels when we touch it how it looks when light touches it there are two basic categories of texture tactile and visual pattern a patterned surface has visible presence in every part of its extent the fact that pattern is usually repetitious gives it rhythmic qualities on a small scale it can make a surface seem more or less important or a space seem larger or smaller than it actually is stripes running vertically make a surface seem narrower and higher running horizontally wider and lower ornament can be seen as an elaboration of texture refers to visual extras unnecessary for practical reasons but added to show off craftsmanship introduce variety and enrich a uniform surface in all ornamentation the key to value is the issue of meaning why is the ornament there does it add something or does it merely cover and confuse good ornament emphasizes what is important draws attention to what is significant and tells something about the materials and workmanship involved materials the actual physical substances of wlich things are made mass a grouping of individual parts or elements that compose a unified body of unspecified size or quantity visual weight large areas of dark colors have greater visual weight than small areas of light colors to achieve balance a small dark area would need to be offset

brought much change to the world of domestic architecture instead of one sty le being in vogue for a long period of time during which it would evolve and progress into the next phase or style now many things were happening concurrently style periods overlapped construction methods changed from timber framing to balloon framing making it possible to change the shapes of buildings architects and builders both had an influence on the types and styles of buildings that were being built in the 20th century the pot was stirred even more vigorously anything and everything was possible and it happened all at the same time and all over the country from 18851940 we experienced a period of romantic revivals it seems as though every style of past centuries was brought back and tried again although not necessarily with the same attention to scale proportion and authenticity of detail hollis escaped this trend to a great degree perhaps because the town was small rural and the population not particularly affluent many of these styles have never existed in hollis some of these revival styles included early colonial revival 18951915 based on colonial prototypes some examples borrowed eighteenthcentury details and applied them to simplified queen anne buildings the scale of the buildings was larger as 53 were the windows paired windows with divided lights on the upper sash only and a side porch are good clues to this style neoclassical revival 18951950 facade dominated by fullheight porch with roof supported by classical columns  columns typically have ionic or corinthian capitals  facade shows symmetrically balanced windows and center door hollis social library is of this style built in 1910 dutch colonial 18901930 gambrel roof where one or both of the lower slopes flare at the eaves in a gentle curve english revival based on medieval gothic or tudor traditions also referred to as elizabethan 19101940 or tudor 18901940 half timbered effect on second story steeply pitched roof large chimney stacks french revival based on the norman farmhouse or small manor french rural 19151940 spanish revival mediterranean spanish mission 18901920 spanish colonial revivalspanish eclectic 19151940 monterey 19251955 two 20th century styles emerged which were developed by successful architects the first the prairie style 19001920 popularized by frank lloyd wright was a new and distinct regional style this style featured open planning shallowpitched roofs with broad sheltering overhangs  bands of casement windows and a strong horizontal emphasis the second the craftsman style 19001930 originated in california and examples designed the brothers greene epitomize this style characterized by the rustic texture of the building materials the buildings are usually one story with a lowpitched gabled roof with wide unenclosed eave overhang with exposed rafter tails at the eaves porches were common either full or partialwidth with roof supported by tapered square columns and often extensive pergolas and trellises over the porches the lower portion of a wall was often battered or sloped near the ground natural materials used for exterior and colors were earth tones prairie and the craftsman also translated into builder house types these buildings were generally small in scale and low in cost we know the prairie as the american foursquare and the craftsman as the bungalow these two types of buildings and others were offered to the public plan books and readycut buildings plans by mail  buildings by rail mail order designs 18751940 were promoted books illustrating building plans for a few dollars the building plans and specifications could be ordered mail and a carpenter or builder could construct from the plans sears roebuck aladdin redicut and other manufacturers offered readycut buildings ordered by mail and shipped by railroad anywhere in the country the building came complete with doors trim nails paint and even plumbing builder house types 19001930 the homestead the foursquare the cottage the bungalow we have examples of each in hollis see  ca the homestead tall narrow and deep two story with a pitched roof a gable front and a porch 108 depot road the foursquare four rooms square two stories high low hipped or pyramidal roof and a porch 5 depot road 1917 the bungalow small long and low one or oneandonehalf story with a conspicuous roofoverhanging eaves and an ample front porch included under the main roof structure usually covered in shingles or shakes in natural earthtone colors 3 main street 1924 the cottage one or oneandonehalf story with a larger upstairs than the bungalow cottages are more vertically oriented than the bungalow and may have colonialera details 81 main street sears mail order building the cobblers shop 31 main street postwar building types after wwii two new building types emerged both became very popular and hollis has a number of examples of each the ranch house one story pitched roof no steps indoor i outdoor living open floor plan sliding glass doors picture windows 72 main street 1955 the split level multiple levels garage on lower level pitched roof sixover six double hung sash windows picture window paneled shutters 31 proctor hill road 105 depot road postwar building styles from about 1950 to ~e present there has again been a revival of the revival styles that marked the beginning of the century these include the neocolonial revival the mansard the neofrench the neotudor the neomediterranean the neovictorian and a new type of french rural 19151940 we are also seeing new buildings reminiscent of the shingle style richardson road and the french chateauesque 1885 1910 richardson road for better or for worse hollis has participated in this resurgence and a drive along many of our country roads or subdivision developments will show examples of a number of these eclectic styles which on the whole do not integrate well with our earlier more traditional new england styles of architecture with their simplicity of line this introduction of architectural styles that are not regional in nature dilutes the smalltown rural character or look of hollis and is an issue that shall be given thoughtful consideration see new construction popular house styles 1945 to 1990s a brief look at some of the other building styles that are popular throughout the country and which may be found here in hollis too follows quotes are taken from american house styles a concise guide by architect john milnes baker aia ww norton and company inc 1994 hoc reference library see bakers drawings of each of the following styles pp 148157 some styles were originated by architects and perhaps later adapted by builders  others come straight from building plan books to be built by local builders either as spec 55 buildings or for clients looking for a modern home many are pale reflections of their original prototypes minimal traditional 19351950 a compromise style of the depression years usually one story or oneandahalf stories multigabled with little or no decorative details often suggestive of the tudor buildings of the 1920s with a front facing gable and a fairly large chimney but with a much shallower roof pitch neocolonial revival 19501970 the realestate developers staple roof pitches are usually too low and windows badly proportioned unlike the colonial revival buildings of the 1920 s they have aluminum siding fixed vinyl blinds and a little brick veneer to dress up the entrance side williamsburg colonial 19501990s colonial williamsburg opened in the early 1930s and this oneandonehalfstory southern colonial has been popular ever since with symmetrical facades and fairly steeply pitched roofs with dormers these buildings are usually of either clapboard or brick builders contemporary 19601985 builders adopted the simplified details and massing of architects contemporary designs vertical siding or clapboards with natural stains large windows and numerous skylights were all characteristic of the style roofs were usually hipped or hipped in combination with lowpitched gables mansard 19601990s the modern builders interpretation of the french roof was another cliche that caught on in the 1960s and is still fairly common it bears little resemblance to the second empire style of the 1870s smooth stucco walls with decorative quoins double front doors and arched windows with louvered blinds are typical features of this style neoshingle 19601980 an unfortunate term given to the first of the socalled postmodern variations these architectdesigned buildings derived from vernacular prototypes and often used shingles though sometimes crisp and unselfconscious they were more often obtuse and perversely iconoclastic disdaining convention in favor of mannered eccentricity builders shed 19651980s the multidirectional shed roofa vernacular formwas widely used by architects in the 1960s and was soon imitated by builders across the country diagonal siding with brown stain and aluminum sliding windows were typical usually there was no projecting overhang or fascia at the eaves and the massing was often complex postmodern 19601990s the term applies to any of the architectdesigned buildings that incorporate details and features from a checklist of trendy cliches stylized classical references and vernacular buildings blend in an amalgamation of affectation pastel colors stripes and eccentricity characterize the style neoclassical revival 19651990s neoneoclassical revival would be a better term the twostory portico is the key feature of this style the disfigured classical orders are inept reflections of the early nineteenth 56 century and turnofthecentury prototypes  neotudor 19651990s tudor is usually applied to almost any frontgabled building with a steeply pitched roof a prominent chimney and fake halftimbered boards these buildings are rarely built of stone as the more authentic tudors were in the 1920s  neomediterranean 19701990s the term applies to almost any vaguely spanish or italian renaissance building with a red tile roof usually simulated stuccoed walls some round arched windows and doors and a fancy front door common in the former spanish territories of california the southwest and florida they are inappropriately built throughout the country neofrench eclectic 19751990s the revival of various traditional styles in the 1970s heralded a rejection of modern architecture and a search for a more pretentious oldhouse look the segmented arches over the windows and doors and the decorative quoins are characteristics of this style front doors are apt to be elaborately embellished with classical motifs nouveau traditional 1980s1990s no style has yet evolved that so grossly and blatantly expresses the ostentations and pretentious excesses of an era neovictorian 19801990s renewed interest in queen anne buildings of the late nineteenth century has launched the usual surge of imitations some of the excesses of the 1980s found expression in the revival of elaborate spindlework scrolls and brackets and the architectural vocabulary of the late victorian era 1990s shingle emphasis on the horizontal axis shingles wrap around the building 1 american vernacular revival 19801990s unpretentious regional architecture can be an excellent starting point for new designs for our era examples of massing of rooms 57 good planning can comfortably complement the vernacular folk architecture of the disparate parts of this country to create contemporary buildings that will never seem dated
