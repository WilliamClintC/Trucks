chapter 7the floodplain administrator shall maintain a permanent record of all variances and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency upon request bcriteria for variances 1variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 2generally the only condition under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing subsections a5a of this section have been fully considered as the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 3variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 4variances shall only be issued upon a ashowing of good and sufficient cause  bdetermination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and cdetermination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subsection a5 of this section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5variances may be issued for a water dependent use provided that the acriteria of subsections a1 of this section are met  and bstructure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety 6variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the statewide inventory of historic properties without regard to the procedures set forth in this section 7variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare 8variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry floodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria and otherwise complies with building codes cvariance decision the decision to either grant or deny a variance shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for such approval and denial if the variance is granted the property owner shall be put on notice along with the written decision that the permitted building will have its lowest floor below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance likely will be commensurate with the increased

days of the date of any permit denial or interpretation of the administrator failure to timely file an appeal shall be considered a failure to exhaust the administrative remedies the appeal must set
