manage the increased rate and velocity of surface water runoff created by certain alterations of the ground cover and natural runoff patterns b this chapter is deemed essential and necessary to protect the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the borough of rutherford and the surrounding communities by accomplishing the following purposes 1 to reduce flood damage to public health life and property 2 to minimize increased stormwater runoff from any new land development 3 to maintain the adequacy of existing and proposed culverts and bridges 4 to induce water recharge into the ground where practical 5 to prevent to the greatest extent feasible an increase in nonpointsource pollution 6 to maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions as well as for drainage and other purposes 7 to reduce the impact of development upon stream erosion in areas where this would be detrimental 8 to reduce erosion from any development or construction project 9 to minimize the increases in runoff pollution due to land development which otherwise would degrade the quality of water and might render it both unfit for human consumption and detrimental to biological life 10 to preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by means of controlling harmful flood discharges stream erosion and runoff pollution 11 to reduce public
