onsite reforestation amended 12122007 by  109 editors note this ordinance also provided that violations shall be subject to the penalty provisions of the plainsboro township 1 plainsboro code  85302  a to protect desirable trees from environmental and mechanical injury during construction activities as well as to protect certain species from erosion and sediment control shade aesthetics songbirds other wildlife dust control noise abatement and oxygen production the following factors shall be considered on any new development sites containing valuable trees 1 tree vigor vigor describes the overall health and physical condition of the tree a tree of low vigor is more susceptible to damage by environmental changes insect infestation and disease than a healthy tree trees of poor vigor typically exhibit at least some of the following conditions minimal new growth death of limbs or branches new growth is especially vulnerable undersized leaves sparse foliage poor foliage color and early fall foliage coloration dangerously hollow or damaged trees with cracked or split limbs or trunks excessively leaning or crooked trees trees with bark separating from their trunks trees with wounds in the bark trees with oozing sap or trees with major portions of their canopy missing should be reviewed on an individual basis 2 tree age very old picturesque trees may be more aesthetically valuable than smaller young trees but will usually require more extensive protection measures only vigorously growing healthy old trees should be protected indications of tree vigor previously disturbed should be used to determine the selection of old trees to be saved large old trees with historic or prominent locations should be carefully evaluated by landscape professionals before being disturbed 3 species many species of trees found in new jersey woodlands are not suitable for shade tree uses around buildings trees that are shortlived or brittle or have soft wood messy leaves or fruit or are frequently attacked by insects and disease should be protected trees shall be planted as determined by the planning board all newly planted trees shall be watered during dry seasons unless prohibited by the township 4 wildlife benefits protecting trees that are preferred by wildlife for food cover and nesting will add to wildlife activity and diversity a mixture of evergreens and hardwoods is beneficial evergreen trees provide cover during the winter months the hardwoods provide valuable food 5 species longevity favor trees with long life spans such as oak beech and tulip poplar shortlived trees should be avoided for use as shade lawn or specimen trees even though they may have an attractive form or pleasing coloration in the spring or fall b soil compaction and physical damage to the roots limbs and trunk are the most common forms of damage to trees during the construction  85302 streets and sidewalks  85302  process the compaction of soil within the dripline of a tree can damage the soil structure and inhibit the transportation of water and air to tree roots to ensure the survival of trees selected to be preserved the following guidelines should be followed 1 protect trees from mechanical damage see figure 1110 2 protect trees scheduled to be preserved within 20 feet of a building site and all vegetation beyond the designated limit of disturbance lines to prevent mechanical and compaction injury fencing or other approved barriers should be a minimum of four feet high and installed at the trees dripline installation should take place before any site disturbance takes place see figure 1111 3 boards will not be nailed to trees during building operations 4 feeder roots should not be cut in an area within the dripline of the trees canopy 5 damaged limbs or trunks shall be painted immediately with a high quality of tree paint care for serious injury should be prescribed by a professional forester or licensed tree expert 6 tree limb removal where necessary will be done flush to the trunk or main branch and that area shall be painted with a high quality of tree paint 7 protect trees against unnecessary cutting breaking or skinning of roots or bark soil or construction materials should not be stored within the dripline of any tree scheduled to be saved prohibit vehicular traffic parking of vehicles or excessive foot traffic within the dripline 8 root damage on any root over 1 12 inches in diameter shall be treated with tree paint in the same manner as treatment to a cut limb temporarily cover all exposed roots with wet burlap to prevent the roots from drying out and cover exposed roots with soil as soon as possible 9 water trees and other vegetation protected from construction traffic as required to maintain their health during the course of construction operations 10 avoid changing the existing ground elevation within the dripline of trees scheduled to be saved if grade changes are absolutely necessary grade changes should be accomplished by following the examples of figure  110 editors note figure 1 is included at the end of this chapter 111 editors note figure 1 is included at the end of
