grove is hereby divided into the following zones a r5a onefamily residential zone minimum lot size five acres the r5a zone is the lowest density residential zoning district in the township the district was established to broaden the array of residential housing options available to township residents and to provide for limited development of properties containing critical environmental resources or designated by the new jersey office of state planning as environmentally sensitive planning areas it is anticipated that large portions of the district may be retained for use as public open space b r40 onefamily residential zone minimum lot size 40000 square feet the r40 zone is established in anticipation of development of lots on properties located on the steep slopes and the tops of the watchung mountains the township began to experience overdevelopment in these critical and environmentally sensitive areas when they were regulated by the r18 zone the zone creates greater open air light and space and is designed to preserve a portion of the lots in their natural state while allowing reasonable use of the land thus respecting the environmentally sensitive nature of these areas c r30 onefamily residential zone minimum lot size 30000 square feet the r30 zone is established to provide greater variety in the availability of lowdensity housing options in the township to create greater open air light and space and to preserve a portion of the lots in their natural state while allowing reasonable use of the land thus respecting the environmentally sensitive nature of these areas the r30 zone provides less restrictive zoning when the property is not affected by either crest lines or steep slopes d r18 onefamily residential zone minimum lot size 18000 square feet the r18 zone is established as a district in which the principal use of the land is for large lot singlefamily homes the district is composed of lowdensity residential areas plus certain open areas where similar residential development appears likely to occur in addition to permitting singlefamily homes and public recreational uses religious and educational facilities are permitted conditional uses encouraged as the basic elements of a balanced neighborhood e r15 onefamily residential zone minimum lot size 15000 square feet the r15 zone is a lowdensity residential zone composed chiefly of singlefamily homes on lots of approximately 13 of an acre together with public recreational religious and educational uses the intent of this section is to encourage the construction of and continued use of  2683 wells cisterns and holes  2683  singlefamily homes and the other basic neighborhood uses permitted by this section f r10 onefamily residential zone minimum lot size 10000 square feet the r10 residential zone is composed of areas within the township which are to a great extent already developed with lots of approximately 10000 square feet in area the intent of this section is to encourage the continued use of the zone as basically singlefamily in character and to discourage and prohibit uses which would substantially interfere with either the development of vacant land for singlefamily homes or the continuation of the predominantly singlefamily character of the district g r8 onefamily residential zone minimum lot size 8000 square feet the r8 zone is the more densely developed of the singlefamily zones and includes older areas in which some nonconforming uses and buildings are to be found the intent of this section is to encourage the continued use of the zone as basically singlefamily in character and to discourage and prohibit uses which would substantially interfere with either the development of vacant land for singlefamily homes or the continuation of the predominantly singlefamily character of the district h mf multifamily residential zone minimum lot size three acres the intent of the mf zone is to provide for integrated multifamily communities of garden apartments and townhouses it is located in areas suited to such development by virtue of proximity to major roadways availability of utility infrastructures compatibility with surrounding land uses and ability to adequately and safely contain multifamily communities and their related amenities regulations require comprehensive planning to ensure orderly site configuration proper vehicular and pedestrian access adequate interior traffic circulation and attractive architectural design i slc senior livingcare residential zone minimum lot size three acres for planned residential retirement communities minimum lot size of 10 acres the slc zoning district is established in recognition of the need for senior citizen housing and residential health care permitted uses within the zone include planned residential retirement communities and longterm care facilities such as nursing homes slc zoning is located in areas with ready access to major roadways and public transportation as well as

addition such other uses as theaters and restaurants in addition it is the intent of this zone to promote the development of the central shopping district with ample offstreet parking and to encourage the tendency of retail commercial development to concentrate to the mutual advantage of both consumers and merchants for the convenience ease and safety of the public and thus to strengthen the economic base of the township l rc restricted commercial zone the rc zone is located in several different areas on both sides of pompton avenue the zone is designated for nonresidential uses limited in a manner intended not to adversely affect the development and vitality of the b district as a welldefined central shopping area the permitted uses in the rc zone are designed to encourage the development of the land in the district primarily for retail uses with additional provisions for professional and business offices recreational uses and commercial schools in addition the zoning will permit special commercialtype uses without area limitations that may attract considerable traffic and parking to locations away from the congestion of the general retail trade area where such uses can be accommodated in beneficial relation to one another m m1 and m2 officewarehouse zones it is the intent of these zones to provide for light manufacturing and warehouse uses while at the same time permitting development of professional andor business offices whether as accessory or principal uses district standards for the height and size of buildings and the area and dimensions of yards and open spaces are intended to minimize the effect of such sites being adjacent to residential areas and to minimize noise glare air pollution water pollution and fire and safety hazards the basic distinction between the m1 and the m2 zones is that the m2 zones are composed of large areas of land where campusstyle development is encouraged on lots larger than that required for the m1 zones n gf
