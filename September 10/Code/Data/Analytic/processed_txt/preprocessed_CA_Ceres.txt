familiar devices of great and worthy charities are fraudulently imposed upon the public  that as the result of pernicious activities honest and needed charities are suffering from a suspicion engendered by these practices and that residents in this city have in many cases been defrauded and imposed upon for lack of adequate protection b that access to information concerning persons making charitable solicitations and to information which fully discloses the uses for which contributed funds are proposed to be used or have been used by persons making charitable solicitations will provide a means for residents of the city to protect themselves from being misled and from making contributions to unworthy persons  that there is no good or compelling reason why persons soliciting charitable contributions should not fully and fairly disclose the convictions for fraud or dishonesty of persons making charitable solicitations the method of conducting charitable solicitations the use of funds obtained and related matters  that such information concerning persons making charitable solicitations their activities and their purposes should be obtained by the coordinator and be made freely available to any interested person  and that to promote the purposes of this the coordinator should publicize the availability of such information as well as publicizing the general nature

2008   part 2001   2000     special provisions for regulation of vacant and boarded buildings purpose the council finds that neglected vacant buildings are a major cause of blight in residential and nonresidential neighborhoods vacant buildings often attract transients and criminals including drug users and prostitutes use of vacant buildings by transients and criminals who may employ primitive cooking or heating methods creates a risk of fire for the vacant building and adjacent properties vacant properties are often used as dumping grounds for drug paraphernalia furniture tires garbage junk and debris and are often overgrown with weeds and grass creating a wide variety of health and safety concerns in addition vacant buildings which are simply boarded up for long periods of time with plywood or other materials to prevent entry by transients or vandals very often discourage economic development disrupting neighborhood stability retarding appreciation of property values and promoting blight conditions all of which interfere with the rights of neighboring property owners and occupants to the full use and enjoyment of their property the city currently expends resources monitoring and responding to vacant buildings because of the numerous health welfare safety and economic problems caused by neglected vacant buildings there is already a substantial cost to the city for monitoring neglected vacant buildings whether or not those buildings are boarded up as well as substantial toll on the citizens who are affected by the nuisance conditions created therefore the city council finds there is an urgent need to refine the process by which these buildings are monitored and remediated boarded buildings are a major cause and source of crime and blight in both residential and nonresidential neighborhoods in addition vacant buildings which are boarded and unkept and which are vacant for long periods of time discourage economic development and retard appreciation of property values a boarded buildingdefined for the purpose of this the term boarded building shall mean a vacant building some or all of whose doors and windows and other openings have

legislative notice of the existence and content of the following studies concerning the adverse secondary side effects of adult businesses in other cities garden grove california 1991  tucson arizona 1990  seattle washington 1989  austin texas 1986  oklahoma city oklahoma 1986  indianapolis indiana 1984  houston texas 1983  beaumont texas 1982  minneapolis minnesota 1980  phoenix arizona 1979  whittier california 1978  amarillo texas 1977  cleveland ohio 1977  los angeles california 1977 the city council finds that these studies are relevant to the problems addressed by the city in enacting this regulate the adverse secondary side effects of adult businesses and more specifically finds that these studies provide convincing evidence that 1 adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates in those areas in which they are located and in surrounding areas 2 both the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adult businesses tend to result in the blighting and deterioration of the areas in which they are located 3 the proximity and concentration of adult businesses adjacent to residential recreational religious educational and other adult business uses can cause other businesses and residences to move elsewhere 4 there is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany concentrate around and be aggravated by adult businesses including but not limited to an increase in the crimes of narcotic distribution and use prostitution pandering and violence against persons and property the studies from other cities establish convincing evidence that adult businesses which are not regulated as to permissible locations often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas causing among other adverse secondary effects an increase in crime and a decrease in property values b based on the foregoing the city council finds and determines that special regulation of adult businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary side effects will not contribute to an increase in crime rates or to the blighting or deterioration of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas the need for such special regulations is based upon the recognition that adult businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to sensitive uses such as parks schools churches thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas it is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration of adult businesses and thereby prevent such adverse secondary side effects c the locational requirements established by this not unreasonably restrict the establishment or operation of constitutionally protected adult businesses in the city and a sufficient reasonable number of appropriate locations for adult businesses are provided by this in developing this the city council has been mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adult businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the first amendments of the united states and california constitutions but instead desires to enact reasonable time place and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses the city council has considered decisions of the united states supreme court regarding local regulation of adult businesses including but not limited to young v american mini theaters inc

county 11th cir 1991 941 f 2d 115 and star satellite v city of biloxi 5th cir 1986 779 f2d 1074 e the city council also finds that locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of adult businesses are in the public interest in addition to the findings and studies conducted in other cities regarding increases in crime rates decreases in property values and the blighting of areas in which such businesses are located the city council also takes legislative notice of the facts recited in the case of kev inc v kitsap county  793 f2d 1053 1986 regarding how live adult entertainment results in secondary effects such as prostitution drug dealing and other law enforcement problems f the city council finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record 1 evidence indicates that some dancers models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adult businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adult businesses on the site of the adult businesses  2 evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by adult businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows  3 evidence indicates that performers at adult businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment  4 evidence indicates that fully enclosed booths individual viewing areas and other small rooms whose interiors cannot be seen from public areas of the establishment regularly have been found to be used as a location for engaging in unlawful sexual activity  5 as a result of the above and the increase in incidents of aids and hepatitis b which are both sexually transmitted diseases the city has a substantial interest in adopting regulations which will reduce to the greatest extent possible the possibility for the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts at adult businesses g zoning licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate reasonable means of accountability to help protect the quality of life in the community of ceres and to help assure that all operators of adult businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places that minimize the adverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation of such businesses h the city council recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such adult businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values and the need and desire of children and minors to stay away from and avoid such businesses which causes children to be fearful and cautious when walking visiting the immediate neighborhood of such businesses  and the city council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary side effects associated with the operation of adult businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens of ceres  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses  deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and sexually transmitted diseases i it is not the intent of the city council in enacting this or any provision thereof to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and the city recognizes that state law prohibits the distribution of the obscene materials and expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the city j nothing in this intended to authorize legalize or permit the establishment operation or maintenance of any business building or use which violates any city ordinance or any statute of the state regarding public nuisances unlawful or indecent exposure sexual conduct lewdness obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof k the city finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record 1 evidence indicates that some dancers models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adult businesses as those terms are defined in this collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adult businesses on the site of the adult business  2 evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by adult businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows  3 evidence indicates that performers at adult businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment  and l in prohibiting public nudity in adult businesses the city council does not intend to proscribe the communication of erotic messages or any other communicative element or activity but rather only to prohibit public nudity due to the secondary impacts associated with such public nudity  and m the city council also finds as a wholly independent basis that it has a substantial public interest in preserving societal order and morality and that such interest is furthered by a prohibition on public nudity  and n while the city council desires to protect the rights conferred by the united states constitution to adult businesses it does so in a manner that ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the city and diminishes to the greatest extent feasible those undesirable secondary effects which the aforementioned studies have shown to be associated with the development and operation of adult businesses  and o in enacting a nudity limitation the city declares the limitation is a regulatory licensing provision and not a criminal offense the city has not provided a criminal penalty for a violation of the nudity limitation the city adopts such a limitation only as a condition of issuance and maintenance of an adult business permit issued pursuant to this   and p the city council finds that preventing the exchange of money between entertainers and patrons also reduces the likelihood of drug and sex transactions occurring in adult businesses  and q requiring separations between entertainers and patrons reduces the likelihood that such persons will negotiate narcotics sales andor transact sexual favors within the adult business r enclosed or concealed booths and dimly lit areas within adult businesses greatly increase the potential for misuse of the premises including unlawful conduct of a type which facilitates transmission of disease requirements that all indoor areas be open to view by management at all times and that adequate lighting be provided are necessary in order to reduce the opportunity for and therefore the incidence of illegal conduct within adult businesses and to facilitate the inspection of the interior of the premises thereof by law enforcement personnel     purpose it is the intent of this prevent communitywide adverse economic impacts increased crime decreased property values and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adult businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors churches and residentially zoned districts or uses the city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area and an increase in crime and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere it is therefore the purpose of this establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses while permitting the location of adult businesses in certain areas it is also the purpose of this regulate adult businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city the provisions of this neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including adultoriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this restrict or deny access by adults to adultoriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adultoriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material    definitions adult business operator adult business operator hereinafter operator means

to establish reasonable rules and regulations regarding the parking and storage of recreational vehicles on both existing and new residential properties in order to promote to general health safety and welfare of the citizens of this community it is the intention of the city council to make a distinction between existing residential properties and new residential properties regarding the degree to which the parking and storage of recreational vehicles is restricted in this regard to city council has determined that existing residential properties typically have less or inadequate area for the parking and storage of recreational vehicles because to homes located thereon were often constructed on smaller lots with minimal side yard setback areas in addition the council further finds that residents of existing residential properties have made substantial investments in recreational vehicles and desire to park and store their vehicles at their residence in the same fashion that they have done over many years the city council also finds 1 that new residential properties within residential zones which are required to have a minimum twelve foot 12 interior side yard setback and are often constructed on larger lots typically have ample space on the side yard andor in a third garage for the parking and storage of recreational vehicles  2 that purchasers of new residential properties within the pc zones are often on smaller lots and have covenants conditions and restrictions to specifically prohibit onsite parking and storage of recreational vehicles  and 3 that purchasers of new residential properties are able to determine in advance of their purchase of the property whether or not they will acquire a recreational vehicle given the restrictions on parking and storage of such vehicles therefore it is the intention of the city council to provide in this regulations which are less strict for existing residential properties and rules and regulations which are more strict for new residential properties  part 2001   scope and application the provisions of this not affect nor have any application to the following a the parking and storage of recreational

provisions of this  10222012  exhibit a part 2002   see this for new construction substantial damage and substantial improvement   variance procedure a nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants nor the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b appeal board 1 in passing upon requests for variances the city council serves as the appeal board and shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this the following a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  e necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  f availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and a floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges 2 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the city manager that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the stanislaus county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf  acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf  acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this  upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient cause  and b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in this  to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in this see definition of public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in this  to the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection c1 of this satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 7 upon consideration of the factors of subsection b of this the purposes of this the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this  reasonable accommodations policy and procedures   title purpose and applicability a title and intent the provisions of this be known as
