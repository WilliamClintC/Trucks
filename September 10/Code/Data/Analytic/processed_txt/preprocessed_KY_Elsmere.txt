planners eric damian kelly faicp and connie b cooper faicp to conduct that study dkelly and cooper have completed that study including the following elements 1field study involving visits to all identified existing sexually oriented businesses in kenton and campbell counties  2meetings with stakeholder groups involved in these businesses  3consultation with the kenton county campbell county

the legislative bodies of kenton and campbell counties for their consideration and use gthat study has been accepted and used by the fiscal court of kenton county in adopting the countywide licensing ordinance kenton county as amended establishing licensing requirements for sexually oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus in 2004 hthe united states supreme court in city of renton v playtime theater inc 475 us 41 1986 held that local governments may rely upon the experiences of other cities as well as on its own studies in enacting local legislation to regulate sexually oriented businesses  ithe united states supreme court in renton and other cases has held that a local government may regulate such uses neutral time place and manner restrictions so long as said regulations are designed to serve the government interest and do not unreasonably omit avenues of communication and are aimed not at the content of protected speech within said establishments but rather at the secondary effects of said establishments on the surrounding communities jthe study by kelly and cooper found extensive physical interaction between patrons and dancers at many of the establishments in both kenton and campbell counties kcovington the only municipality in kenton county that has had sexually oriented businesses within its border from  to  the police made a total of 469 calls to sexually oriented businesses in the city the crimes committed at these establishments during this time period included robbery assault fraud malicious mischief public intoxication and possession of illegal drugs in addition on  covington police arrested three individuals for prostitutionrelated charges at libertys show lounge a sexually oriented cabaret in the city las the sixth circuit court of appeals noted in a decision addressing issues related to the adult entertainment ordinance in the city of newport campbell county there is a long history underlying efforts to regulate sex businesses in northern kentucky 1defendant city of newport city or newport long ago gained a reputation as home to a veritable smorgasbord of vice attracting patrons from across the nation for decades the small city was considered the midwests answer to las vegas and leaders of organized crime were said to operate its gambling casinos and nightclubs 2in the 1960s public pressure began to demand that newport be cleaned up this pressure has continued until the present with varying degrees of success 3a 1986 report generated by the newport alcoholic beverage control administrator indicated that of 28 adult bars opened since 1978 including successive bars at the same site 21 had had at least one prostitutionrelated conviction and 18 had had multiple convictions def ex k p 2 the report explained that all of the prostitution in businesses with adult entertainment involved an alcoholic beverage as the median sic of exchange and the solicitation of such drinks by mixers id in all 98% of prostitution arrests in newport occurred in the vicinity of these bars id adult entertainment establishments which constituted 12% of all businesses serving alcohol accounted for 17% of all police runs def ex k p 21 4a later review conducted in 1990 by the newport license inspector documented the continued prostitution arrests occurring at several adult dancing establishments def ex g moreover the city determined that over $70000 was expended in 1990 to target patrol and prosecute the illicit behavior occurring in and around the bars def ex h 5several of newports citizens merchants and church groups also opposed the presence of the seminude dancing clubs these groups generally believed that the adult entertainment clubs were clouds over the neighborhood that keep it from growing in the right direction see def ex i letter to mayor from taylors landing business district complaints commonly expressed were that the seamy establishments deterred other merchants from locating in newports

those findings the court went on to hold in relevant part ahaving considered the matter carefully the court concludes that some leeway must be afforded the reform efforts of the city council of newport this body has been elected by the citizens to attempt to clean up the image of the city bto do this it must overcome the sleazy impression of newport and northern kentucky that survives from the heyday when things ran wide open  reform candidates were literally drugged and framed for morals offenses by public officials and police officers  the members of reform citizens groups were vilified and harassed  and a liberal in local parlance was a person favoring the continued open and notorious violation of the gambling and morals laws cto illustrate that the councils perception of a need to clean up the image of the city is not paranoid the court notes the following statements in a national magazines satirical newports big sister the city of cincinnati the citys streets fairly shine  the odd titterer draws a scornful stare wide avenues bosky side streets the most inviting of thoroughfares and clean so clean no xrated movie theaters no adultbook stores no barebreasted night

city of newport has the right to secede as cincinnatis combat zone 8the court holds that the city has an important and substantial governmental interest in advancing these reform goals which interest is furthered by the ordinances in question barnes 111 s ct at 2461 the court further finds and holds that in the case of the city of newport given its unique history the ordinances incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest id quoting obrien 391 us at 37677 88 s ct at 167879 9newports image affects that of

this interest and will be upheld 830 fsupp at 384  mthe supreme court had earlier noted in upholding another regulation in newport it is plain that as in bellanca the interest in maintaining order outweighs the interest in free expression by dancing nude newport v iacobucci 479 us 92 97 93 l ed 2d 334 340 107 s ct 383 386 1986 although the significance of the opinion itself is now questionable see j&b social club # 1 v city of mobile 966 f supp 113 1135 sd ala 1996 the quoted part of the opinion stands unchallenged nthe cities of covington and newport continue their efforts to improve their image since 1985 covington has redeveloped its riverfront creating several new office towers highend condominiums hotels and a convention center in newport in conjunction with private development and southbank partners inc the city has built a major entertainment center along the river this initiative has promoted improved pedestrian and transit connections in northern kentuckys river cities to and from the stadiums and other attractions along the cincinnati riverfront odespite these efforts the areas of downtown covington and newport away from the riverfront continue to suffer in many ways the study by kelly and cooper found in the area near to existing sexually oriented uses a number of building vacancies and building maintenance falling far short of that found in the revitalized areas near the river pthe city council respects the constitutional rights of its citizens including the right to present certain types of entertainment that may not appeal to the entire population through this ordinance it is the desire of the city council to balance the constitutional rights of businesses that present sexually oriented entertainment with the city council interests in ensuring that this community not suffer from the same sorts of adverse effects that covington and newport have long suffered qfrom long experience in covington and newport as well as from the following studies and others not listed the city council also finds that such businesses may have primary and secondary effects involving crimes related to the activities in the establishments of which prostitution and crimes of violence are those of greatest concern see for example 1final report to the city of garden grove the relationship between crime and adult business operations on garden grove boulevard

regulating sex businesses planning advisory service report no 49596 chicago american planning association 2000  pages 5157 11the tucson study consisting of two memos one from the citizens advisory planning committee addressed to the mayor and city council and dated   and the other from an assistant chief of police to the city prosecutor regarding adult entertainment  dated  rthe city council recognizes that some of the cited studies included bars without sexually oriented entertainment among the businesses studied  the city council finds nevertheless that addressing the establishments that have live sexually oriented entertainment is a more critical local issue than that of bars without such entertainment for three reasons 1bars in kentucky are already regulated by the commonwealth and those state regulations directly address many of the concerns that arise with the service of alcohol  2the local history of prostitution and sexrelated crimes has largely been related to businesses with live sexually oriented entertainment and not with other establishments that serve alcohol  and 3the interaction between dancers who are paid to work with very limited clothing and the customers who pay to see them work in the establishments with live entertainment creates a sexually charged environment and the opportunity to negotiate for the provision of additional services that do not involve dancing or other protected expression and that are simply unacceptable under the standards of the county and its citizens sas noted earlier in these findings there is a long local history of prostitution and sexrelated crimes at or incident to the operation of establishments with live sexually oriented entertainment further the studies shown herein provide further evidence of the potential crimerelated secondary effects from such businesses although the methodologies and quality of these studies vary somewhat local experience has demonstrated to the city council that the relationship between crime and such establishments is a fact in northern kentucky and not just a theory published in a study tthe city council has reviewed evidence and testimony presented at public meetings before the county and information based on the past experiences of the kenton and campbell counties and the cities of covington and newport the experiences of the county attorneys offices prosecuting numerous and varied offenses that have occurred in and around the sexually oriented entertainment establishments and based upon the documented experiences of other governmental units within kentucky and elsewhere in dealing with the impact of sexually oriented entertainment that such businesses can if not properly regulated be deleterious to said community uthe city council finds that the countywide licensing ordinance related to sexually oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus adopted by the fiscal court of kenton county is an effective tool for addressing the many operational issues that can arise with such businesses vthe city council finds that amendments to the citys zoning the location and design of such businesses are important variables in the nature and extent of adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on the community and further finds that location and design are among the types of issues that are typically addressed wbased on the recommendations of kelly and cooper which are based on their experience in other communities and their review of the studies cited above and other local efforts to address such secondary effects the city council finds that the following principles are essential to effective zoning controls of sexually oriented businesses 1sexually oriented businesses should to the maximum extent practicable be separated from one another by a distance that is greater than a convenient walking distance because experience elsewhere has shown that the location of such businesses near one another may increase the adverse secondary effects particularly those related to crime by a greater than arithmetic factor  2although there are currently several such businesses located near one another in covingtons downtown area the covington city commission has determined that the city will not attempt to require these existing businesses be relocated  3sexually oriented businesses have the greatest adverse effect on residential neighborhoods and should thus be separated to the maximum extent practicable from residential neighborhoods  4sexually oriented businesses are likely to attract criminal elements that prey on soft targets including children and it is thus important to separate sexually oriented businesses from schools parks recreation centers and religious institutions all of which are places where children are likely to congregate often without parental protection  5also because of the tendency of sexually oriented businesses to attract criminal elements that prey on soft targets it is important to seek locations for such businesses that are not located along pedestrian routes where young people old people and others who are vulnerable are likely to walk in going about their daytoday business thus locations to which the primary access is by automobile minimize the risk of persons going about their daily business encountering persons who are visiting or even loitering around the sexually oriented business  6experiences in other communities show that private booths back rooms vip rooms and other small and private spaces in sexually oriented businesses create the opportunity for casual sexual activity and create logistical difficulties and risks of physical endangerment for police officers responsible for dealing with such activities for that reason it is essential that movies performances and other activities at sexually oriented businesses should be permitted only in large rooms that are open and visible to management other patrons and code and police officers who may visit the establishment during operating hours xfindings the facts and other matters set forth in divisions a w that form the preamble to this chapter are hereby adopted as

herein phased zoning regulations a phased zoning is an overlay type regulation to be used in cases where the timing andor phasing of the zoning of an area is especially critical to the implementation of the adopted comprehensive plan the intent of the phased zoning regulations is to encourage redevelopment of a specified area for the use andor density designated within the comprehensive plan when the necessary conditions for such development are realized eg demolition of existing buildings implicit in such a phased zoning approach is the premise that until such conditions are realized the type of development designated within the comprehensive plan is premature  such development would be prevented by temporarily zoning the area to generally conform with the predominant existing land use with a clear stipulation of an intended future rezoning which would be in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan b the phased zoning regulations may be overlaid over any zoning classification by means of a zone change process the use of the phased zoning regulations would indicate that the regulations of the overlaid zone are currently being enforced based upon the general existing land use but upon attainment of all the requirements of the zone which corresponds to the adopted comprehensive plan for the type of use andor density the area could be rezoned in direct compliance with the plan c phased zones are indicated on the official zoning map by adding to the overlaid zone the letter p as a suffix enclosed in parentheses for example in order to properly phase its change an area zoned r1c which is identified for future use on the adopted comprehensive plan for industrial could be temporarily zoned r1cp indicating that present development on the site would be in conformance with the regulations of the overlaid r1c zone but that upon the attainment of certain conditions eg provision of an adequate access road demolition of existing buildings the area could be rezoned zone change procedure general regulations 928 elsmere zoning pds to an industrial zone at the time of the zone change the temporary r1cp zone is removed and the area is developed according to

that a local government may regulate such uses neutral time place and manner restrictions so long as said regulations are designed to serve the government interest and do not unreasonably omit avenues of communication and are aimed not at the content of protected speech within said establishments but rather at the secondary effects of said establishments on the surrounding communities j the study

issues related to the adult entertainment ordinance in the city of newport campbell county there is a long history underlying efforts to regulate sex businesses in northern kentucky defendant city of newport city or newport long ago gained a reputation as home to a veritable smorgasbord of vice attracting patrons from across the nation for decades the small city was considered the midwests answer to las vegas and leaders of organized crime were said to operate its gambling casinos and nightclubs in the 1960s public pressure began to demand that newport be cleaned up this pressure has continued until the present with varying degrees of success a 1986 report generated by the newport alcoholic beverage control administrator indicated that of 28 adult bars opened since 1978 including successive bars at the same site 21 had had at least one prostitutionrelated conviction and 18 had had multiple convictions def ex k p 2 the report explained that all of the prostitution in businesses with adult entertainment involved an alcoholic beverage as the median sic of exchange and the solicitation of such drinks by mixers id in all 98% of prostitution arrests in newport occurred in the vicinity of these bars id adult entertainment establishments which constituted 12% of all businesses serving alcohol accounted for 17% of all police runs def ex k p 21 a later review conducted in 1990 by the newport license inspector documented the continued prostitution arrests occurring at several adult dancing establishments def ex g moreover the city determined that over $ 70000 was expended in 1990 to target patrol and prosecute the illicit behavior occurring in and around the bars def ex h several of newports citizens merchants and church groups also opposed the presence of the seminude dancing

the court went on to hold in relevant part having considered the matter carefully the court concludes that some leeway must be afforded the reform efforts of the city council of newport this body has been elected by the citizens to attempt to clean up the image of the city to do this it must overcome the sleazy impression of newport and northern kentucky that survives from the heyday when things ran wide open  reform candidates were literally drugged and framed for morals offenses by public officials and police officers  the members of reform citizens groups were vilified and harassed  and a

questionable see j&b social club # 1 v city of mobile 966 f supp 113 1135 sd ala 1996 the quoted part of the opinion stands unchallenged n the cities of covington and newport continue their efforts to improve their image since 198 covington has redeveloped its riverfront creating several new office towers highend condominiums hotels and a convention center in newport in conjunction with private development and southbank partners inc the city has built a major entertainment center along the river this initiative has promoted improved pedestrian and transit connections in northern kentuckys river cities to and from the stadiums and other attractions along the cincinnati riverfront o despite these efforts the areas of downtown covington and newport away from the riverfront continue to suffer in many ways the study by kelly and cooper found in the area near to existing sexually oriented uses a number of building vacancies and building maintenance falling far short of that found in the revitalized areas near the river p the city of elsmere respects the constitutional rights of its citizens including the right to present certain types of entertainment that may not appeal to the entire population through this ordinance it is the desire of the city of elsmere to balance the constitutional rights of businesses that present sexually oriented entertainment with the city of elsmere interests in ensuring that this community not suffer from the same sorts of adverse effects that covington and newport have long suffered q from long experience in covington and newport as well as from the following studies and others not listed the city of elsmere also finds that such businesses may have primary and secondary effects involving crimes related to the activities in the establishments of which prostitution and crimes of violence are those of greatest concern see for example 1 final report to the city of garden grove the relationship between crime and adult business

11 the tucson study consisting of two memos one from the citizens advisory planning committee addressed to the mayor and city council and dated   and the other from an assistant chief of police to the city prosecutor regarding adult entertainment dated  r the city of elsmere recognizes that some of the cited studies included bars without sexually oriented entertainment among the businesses studied  the city of elsmere finds nevertheless that addressing the establishments that have live sexually oriented entertainment is a more critical local issue than that of bars without such entertainment for three reasons 1 bars in kentucky are already regulated by the commonwealth and those state regulations directly address many of the concerns that arise with the service of alcohol  2 the local history of prostitution and sexrelated crimes has largely been related to businesses with live sexually oriented entertainment and not with other establishments that serve alcohol  and 3 the interaction between dancers who are paid to work with very limited clothing and the customers who pay to see them work in the establishments with live entertainment creates a sexually charged environment and the opportunity to negotiate for the provision of additional services that do not involve dancing or other protected expression and that are simply unacceptable under the standards of the county and its citizens general regulations 935 elsmere zoning pds s as noted earlier in these findings there is a long local history of prostitution and sexrelated crimes at or incident to the operation of establishments with live sexually oriented entertainment further the studies shown herein provide further evidence of the potential crimerelated secondary effects from such businesses although the methodologies and quality of these studies vary somewhat local experience has demonstrated to the city of elsmere that the relationship between crime and such establishments is a fact in northern kentucky and not just a theory published in a study t the city of elsmere has reviewed evidence and testimony presented at public meetings before the county and information based on the past experiences of the kenton and campbell counties and the cities of covington and newport the experiences of the county attorneys offices prosecuting numerous and varied offenses that have occurred in and around the sexually oriented entertainment establishments and based upon the documented experiences of other governmental units within kentucky and elsewhere in dealing with the impact of sexually oriented entertainment that such businesses can if not properly regulated be deleterious to said community u the city of elsmere finds that the countywide licensing ordinance related to sexually oriented businesses and service oriented escort bureaus adopted by the fiscal court of kenton county is an effective tool for addressing the many operational issues that can arise with such businesses v the city of elsmere finds that amendments to the citys zoning the location and design of such businesses are important variables in the nature and extent of adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses on the community and further finds that location and design are among the types of issues that are typically addressed w based on the recommendations of kelly and cooper which are based on their experience in other communities and their review of the studies cited above and other local efforts to address such secondary effects the city of elsmere finds that the following principles are essential to effective zoning controls of sexually oriented businesses 1 sexually oriented businesses should to the maximum extent practicable be separated from one another by a distance that is greater than a convenient walking distance because experience elsewhere has shown that the location of such businesses near one another may increase the adverse secondary effects particularly those related to crime by a greater than arithmetic factor  2 although there are currently several such businesses located near one another in covingtons downtown area the covington city commission general regulations 936 elsmere zoning pds has determined that the city will not attempt to require these existing businesses be relocated  3 sexually oriented businesses have the greatest adverse effect on residential neighbourhoods and should thus be separated to the maximum extent practicable from residential neighbourhoods  4 sexually oriented businesses are likely to attract criminal elements that prey on soft targets including children and it is thus important to separate sexually oriented businesses from schools parks recreation centers and religious institutions all of which are places where children are likely to congregate often without parental protection  5 also because of the tendency of sexually oriented businesses to attract criminal elements that prey on soft targets it is important to seek locations for such businesses that are not located along pedestrian routes where young people old people and others who are vulnerable are likely to walk in going about their daytoday business thus locations to which the primary access is by automobile minimize the risk of persons going about their daily business encountering persons who are visiting or even loitering around the sexually oriented business  6 experiences in other communities show that private booths back rooms vip rooms and other small and private spaces in sexually oriented businesses create the opportunity for casual sexual activity and create logistical difficulties and risks of physical endangerment for police officers responsible for dealing with such activities for that reason it is essential that movies performances and other activities at sexually oriented businesses should be permitted only in large rooms that are open and visible to management other patrons and code and police officers who may visit the establishment during operating hours x findings the facts and other matters set forth in the previous clauses that form the preamble to this ordinance are hereby adopted as findings of fact in support of the legislative action of the city of elsmere in adopting this amendment to the zoning adoption of this zoning amendment these shall be incorporated into the

hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and general regulations 953 elsmere zoning pds

variances the variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the legislative body to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate 2 designation of variance and appeal board a the board of adjustment shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of these regulations 3 duties of board of adjustment a the board of adjustment shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or

procedures general regulations 987 elsmere zoning pds in passing upon such applications the board of adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this ordinance and the a danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  b danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  c susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  d importance to the community of the services provided by the existing or proposed facility  e necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent use  f availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  g compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  h relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  i safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  j expected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and k costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges and culverts 5 conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance the board of adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance a variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result b variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this ordinance for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this general regulations 988 elsmere zoning pds means the legislative body need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the legislative body believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance c variances shall only be issued upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause  ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and iii a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances d any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the lowest floor being situated below the base flood elevation e the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema upon request f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of 4 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance 6 variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage  b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the general regulations 989 elsmere zoning pds floodplain administrator in the office of the kenton county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land c the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance or denial and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the federal emergency management agency 7 historic structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see definition upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure g severability this ordinance and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable should any section of this ordinance be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid such decision shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any portion thereof other than the section so declared

sign regulations 141 elsmere zoning pds article xiv sign regulations short title this be known as the sign the city of elsmere purpose and interests served a the purpose of this to establish a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of signs within the jurisdiction of the city of elsmere these regulations are designed to protect and promote the public health safety and welfare by controlling the type number location and physical dimensions of signs to prevent the disruptions obstructions and hazards to vehicular and pedestrian traffic that signs may cause and to enhance the quality of the environment in residential and nonresidential districts as a basis for adopting these regulations the city of elsmere finds 1 signs are an essential form of communication in the built environment providing wayfinding guides to residents visitors public safety officials customers and potential customers of local businesses delivery people and others 2 signs also provide communication on public issues as the us supreme court found in city of ladue v gilleo signs that react to a local happening or express a view on a controversial issue both reflect and animate change in the life of a community often placed on lawns or in windows residential signs play an important part in political campaigns during which they are displayed to signal the residents support for particular candidates parties or causes they may not afford the same opportunities for conveying complex ideas as do other media but residential signs have long been an important and distinct medium of expression 3 retailers and other businesses depend on signs to help people find their businesses and in a large and expensive media market like that of cincinnati a market which includes elsmere many small businesses depend on signs as one of the most affordable forms of advertising 4 although signs thus serve many important purposes in society in general and in elsmere in particular there are other considerations that the city of elsmere weighs heavily 5 signs may distract drivers and lead to deaths and injuries to pedestrians and cyclists as well as to drivers and passengers and to property damage moving flashing and rapidly changing signs are particularly distracting to drivers a proliferation of signs on a particular site can have the same sign regulations 142 elsmere zoning pds effect as moving signs as drivers try to sort visual cacophony to find the information that they want or need 6 the elsmere city council with the advice of the kenton county planning commission and its professional staff and with input from residents direction 2030 your voice your choice planning process has placed an increasing emphasis on preserving the sense of place and the design of the built environment  limiting the size height and number of signs is an important tool in preserving a sense of place a tool that accompanies the countys standards for landscaping 7 direction 2030 your voice your choice recommends that policies regulations and incentives be developed and implemented that preserve and improve the existing community fabric 8 balancing these competing considerations is particularly difficult in residential areas where people value both their pleasing and visually appealing environments and their ability to communicate their opinions regarding candidates and public issues signs 9 in updating its ordinance in 2016 after the supreme courts landmark decision in reed v town of gilbert the elsmere city council working with pds staff and an outside consultant has made a major effort to limit content as a factor in its sign regulations after due consideration however it has concluded that one way to leave room for extensive free expression in residential areas while limiting total sign clutter is to maintain significant limits on commercial signs in residential areas recognizing the importance of for sale and for lease signs in maintaining the occupancy of healthy neighborhoods see the us supreme court decision in linmark associates inc v willingboro those signs must remain there is a similar utility in providing for yard sale signs which allow people to dispose of unwanted items without sending them to a landfill 10 although as the court found in reed v gilbert time limits on signs can be arbitrary as the court recognized in 2009 in pleasant grove v city of summum a significant distinction between speakers expressing an opinion and signs is that speakers however longwinded will eventually come to the end of their remarks members of the elsmere city council have long noted that signs for political campaigns as well as those advertising pancake breakfasts and spaghetti dinners for civic organizations are often abandoned after the events contributing to clutter long after they have served their purpose although such signs were once typically paper or cardboard that would eventually decay many today are plastic and will remain until removed thus despite the expressed concern of the supreme court with time limits the elsmere city council finds that it has a substantial governmental interest in clarifying the status of signs for past events that thus no longer serve a purpose so that there is a legal basis for the city of elsmere to remove them or force their removal sign regulations 143 elsmere zoning pds 11 the city of elsmere has long allowed unlimited numbers of small signs bearing noncommercial messages to allow merchants and others to designate handicapped parking places provide directions to atms and restrooms warn of guard dogs and other hazards and provide a variety of other placebased information with the prohibition of commercial messages on such signs it has been the observation of elsmere city council members and their professional staff members that property owners are judicious and appropriate in posting such signs the city of elsmere thus finds that it has a substantial interest in allowing merchants and property owners freely to post necessary informational signs but without allowing an endless proliferation of commercial messages 12 although in findings above the city of elsmere has recognized the multiple values of signs in the built environment elsmere officials after consultation with the planning commission and representatives of cities and towns in the county concluded several years ago that there is no place for signs of overwhelming size and no relation to context in an urban and urbanizing environment like elsmere although previous versions of these regulations followed the pattern of state and federal laws by defining such billboard as offsite signs this ordinance addresses the same issue by establishing a form of circuit breaker size limit prohibiting very large signs on small lots on vacant lots or on lots with only small buildings 13 these are complex public policy issues and the elsmere city council with the help of its professional planners attorneys and outside consultant has attempted to balance the competing considerations in a way that it believes best protects the public health safety and welfare of the citizens of elsmere including its many valued businesses and the thousands of visitors who arrive or pass city of elsmere each month temporary signs a one temporary sign will be permitted on each lot in a nonresidential zone

and incorporated into public and private infrastructure and geotechnical exploration and earthwork construction requirements 481 purpose pavement in public streets including subdivision streets is one of the largest physical assets by dollar value owned by various kenton county legislative bodies citycounty the purpose of this section is twofold the first is to inform all in kenton county who have responsibilities in the design construction and maintenance of subdivision streets of important facts about the nature of pavements and their individual responsibilities in obtaining good longterm pavement performance in new kenton county subdivisions the second is to set out some of the critical engineering analysis and reasoning used to establish the pavement pavement subgrade and pavement

pavement performance and design existing subdivision pavement 482 performance analysis during the process of reviewing this 2014 update of the kenton county subdivision regulations there was a substantial community discussion on subdivision pavement design construction and performance during the late stages of this community discussion at the suggestion of the kenton county judge executive and several city mayors and authorization of the planning commission chairman a committee of five local pavement professionals with extensive and longterm experience in the design construction and maintenance of subdivision pavements was formed this committee was asked as a voluntary community service to do the following analyze existing subdivision pavement performance evaluate that performance compared to reasonable expectations for pavement performance and make recommendations that would improve pavement customer value in future subdivision pavements all earlier community discussion on pavement performance was to be considered as input into their process appendix c engineers committee final report contains this committees final report to the planning commission in this regard the recommendations of this report were an important source of information that was used in the formation of these subdivision pavement regulations 483 important pavement facts there is no perfect pavement no pavement lasts indefinitely and all pavements require maintenance repair and refurbishment on a timely basis in order to minimize long term pavement costs all professional pavement design procedures recognize that all pavements will eventually fail regardless of how well they are built either by the impacts of weathering the impacts of repetitive heavy vehicle axle loads or both professional engineering pavement design also recognizes pavement will have local failures during its life because of the imperfect nature of the natural soil subgrade pavement materials and construction techniques pavements designed by pavement professionals are therefore designed with assumptions and calculations of the need for maintenance repair of isolated failures and refurbishment during the pavement life all pavement literature recognizes that the three essential components of good pavement performance are a proper pavement design for the in situ conditions b proper construction consistent with the design and c proper and timely maintenance and repair failure in the proper execution of any one of these three components will lead to very substantial increases in long term pavement cost andor inadequate pavement serviceability these three components are discussed further below a pavement design the following is a discussion of certain important elements of the engineering approach taken to establish the pavement design materials and construction methods specified for subdivision streets in  pavement design method and required thicknesses 7 asphalt concrete asphalt paving mixture and construction specifications and geotechnical exploration and earthwork construction requirements 1 proper pavement engineering design requires economic analysis of pavement design alternatives for an indepth discussion of the engineering economics of pavements see of the aashto 93 pavement design manual the economic engineering design objective used herein is to minimize pavement 50 year net present value life cycle costs to the pavement customer while maintaining adequate pavement serviceability the pavement customer is defined as the amalgamation of the subdivision lothome purchaser occupant tax payer and citizen there is no attempt to differentiate any of these customer subgroups collectively they are the pavement customer the customer pays all of the costs of pavement home purchase price rent and various forms of taxes kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design pavement cost over the pavement life cycle includes construction costs  maintenance repair and refurbishment costs  and costs related to the time value of money thus net present value these various costs include any overhead and profit that is related to the goods and services provided a 50 year life cycle was chosen for the analysis period because there is substantial local experience that demonstrates subdivision pavements when properly designed built maintained and resurfaced can last 50 years or more a longer analysis period was not chosen because transportation modes and pavement loading maintenance and repair methods and materials and all sorts of other related factors are simply not foreseeable beyond 50 years pavement designs herein are also designed with a 20 year design life or performance period defined as the time that an initial pavement will last before it needs rehabilitation pavement designs presented herein are designed to last at least 50 years as long as properly constructed maintained and resurfaced over the 50 year period as shown in c pavement maintenance herein figure a1aa detail #25 also shows a method of extending the pavement life past 50 years using existing refurbishment and resurfacing methods any alternate pavement design submitted for a particular subdivision by a pavement design professional must also include a 20 year design life and a 50 year life cycle maintenance repair and resurfacing analysis including relevant traffic loading 2 the pavement subgrade is the soil directly under the pavement pavements rely on the subgrade for structural support subgrades must therefore be constructed of soils with adequate load bearing capacity properly prepared portland cement concrete concrete is a rigid pavement and spreads traffic loads over a larger subgrade area as compared to asphalt cement concrete asphalt pavement which is a flexible pavement because of this wheel load distribution difference in the nature of these two pavement types asphalt pavements require a higher minimum subgrade bearing capacity than concrete pavements pavement specifications herein require subgrade soils that when properly prepared will produce a bearing capacity or california bearing ratio cbr of 2 or greater for concrete pavement and cbr of 3 or greater for asphalt pavement a substantial majority not all of potential future subdivision sites in kenton county have natural soils that when properly prepared will produce an adequate subgrade bearing capacity to support concrete or asphalt but not necessarily both for subdivision locations with in situ soils that will not produce these minimum bearing capacities for the pavement type that the developer selects properly designed and built subgrade improvements will be required quality control of asbuilt subgrades is a very important component of assuring the expected pavement design performance 3 the repetition of equivalent 18000 pound single axle loads esals going over the pavement during its life is one mode of eventual pavement failure therefore estimates of esals are required to properly design pavements pavement designs herein include esal loading estimates during land development construction building construction and traffic activity after full building occupancy the estimate methods and quantities are shown in kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design figure c1a exhibit a any alternate pavement designs must be based on these esal estimates or greater 4 pavement surface and subsurface storm water conditions are another important consideration in pavement design the primary engineering design methods for minimizing the negative effects of storm water on pavement and pavement subgrades are 1 preventing water from entering the pavement 2 providing drainage that quickly removes excess water that enters the pavement and 3 building the pavement strong enough to resist the combined effects of wheel load and water because asphalt is more porous and has higher reliance on subgrade strength as compared to concrete pavement accounting for the potential negative effects of water entering asphalt pavements and pavement subgrade is more critical for asphalt pavements the design features specified in these regulations use all three methods listed above to minimize the negative effects of storm water on subdivision pavement the primary pavement requirements used in these regulations for effective storm water surface and subsurface management are as follows a rural development streets i three percent surface cross slope as shown in figure a1e detail #5 and figure a1f detail #6 ii subgrade cross slope of three percent for concrete streets and three percent +2 inches for asphalt streets as shown in figure a1c detail #3 figure a1d detail #4 figure a1e detail #5 and figure a1f detail #6 iii drainage ditches on both sides of the street where the ditch depth is always deeper than the subgrade at the outside edge of pavement as shown in figure a1e detail #5 and figure a1f detail #6 b suburban and urban streets most subdivision pavements likely to be built in kenton county will be classified as urban or suburban these streets are built with curb and gutter the pavement with curb and gutter serves as a surface storm water conduit which is designed to collect surface storm water off the street and off adjoining subdivision lots and transport that storm water to street catch basins which connect to storm sewers street design requirements herein are designed to get and keep storm water in the gutter flow line of these streets as much as practical i all streets a curb and gutter and three percent surface cross grade to get and keep storm water in the gutter line until it is collected at catch basins see figure a1c detail #3 and figure a1d detail #4 b build public sidewalk so that the edge nearest the street is built six inches above the adjacent curb on sloped curbs and three inches above the curb on barrier curbs this maintains positive street drainage even after multiple pavement overlays see figure a1c detail #3 and figure a1d detail #4 c install continuous edge drain at the outside edge of the pavement on both sides of the street as shown in figure a1c detail #3 figure a1d kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design detail #4 figure a1x detail #22 and figure a1y detail #23 this edge drain will help drain the subgrade help keep surface water from the outside edge of the pavement out of the subgrade and will help drain joints in concrete and the asphaltconcrete curb and gutter interface d provide for subgrade drainage and edge drain drainage at all paired catch basins as shown on the required street cross at catch basin crossings in figure a1b detail #2 ii concrete streets a all pavement joints are properly sealed with joint sealing compound to minimize water penetrating those joints and getting into the subgrade b all pavements are built with a three percent subgrade cross grade see figure a1c detail #3 and figure a1e detail #5 continuous from centerline to edge of curb which will help any water that gets into the subgrade to the outside of the curb and to the edge drain iii asphalt streets a the surface course of asphalt has been designed to minimize the water that will penetrate the pavement and get into the subgrade b the finish course of asphalt is built  inch above the curb apron to force any surface water toward the gutter line rather than allow the water to lay out in the pavement surface for extended periods of time c the curb apron is built with a six percent cross pitch to keep water in the gutter line d the asphalt joint at the concrete curb apron is sealed with joint sealer to keep water from penetrating joint into the subgrade e the subgrade is built with a three percent plus two inch cross slope and is built continuously from the centerline to the outside of the curb to help drain the subgrade and help minimize the potential for water penetrating into the subgrade from the outside edge of the pavement f the first course of pavement base asphalt or kytc crushed stone base is continuous from the centerline to the outside edge of the pavement and the concrete curb and gutter is built on top of the first course of base which will help keep water from penetrating the subgrade at the outside edge of the pavement and will help support the curb and reduce potential for curb breakage in regards to building the pavement strong enough to resist the combined effects of wind and water the subgrade design parameters used in table 441 account for substantial kenton county seasonal variability in subgrade support consistent with substantial change in water content of subgrade soils seasontoseason 5 there are many other design material and construction method details set out in  pavement design method and required thicknesses 7 asphalt concrete asphalt paving mixture and construction specifications geotechnical exploration and earthwork construction requirements and appendix a standard kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design construction drawings that are important to good pavement performance because these details are not discussed here does not diminish their importance b pavement construction quality control construction quality control which means building the pavement with good construction practices and in substantial conformance with these subdivision regulations and the approved construction design drawings is the responsibility of the subdivision developer and its agents who are the engineers and construction contractors hired by that developer to design and build that subdivisions improvements the planning commissions role in construction quality control is staff or other quality control service provider to confirm and document that the subdivision design drawings satisfy these regulations and that the inplace subdivision improvements are built in substantial accordance to these subdivision regulations and the subdivision design drawings c pavement maintenance the need for and benefit of timely and adequate maintenance by the street pavements owners is documented throughout the pavement literature failure to properly and timely maintain pavements will lead to substantially increased customer pavement costs andor diminished pavement serviceability 1 recommended 50 year life cycle maintenance the following is a schedule for maintenance repair and resurfacing that can be expected in an effort to minimize customer 50 year life cycle costs for subdivision pavements a recommended asphalt pavement owner maintenance minor maintenance  joint and crack seal every three years  spot curb repair  spot pavement repair major maintenance  at approximately +17 years  spot

pavement lengthening below  localized failure repairs major maintenance  at approximately +17 years  spot curb repair  spot slab repair  at approximately +34 years  spot curb repair  spot slab and joint repair  inspect for erosion tunneling under pavement mud jack as necessary  mill concrete two inches deep at or near the concrete gutter line to zero inches deep six feet out from the gutter line  install asphalt skim coat and stress absorbing asphalt membrane interlayer sami over the width of the pavement  install 1inch deep asphalt surface overlay with a four percent gutter line to centerline cross slope c management of concrete pavement lengthening concrete pavements can expand in length later in the pavements life as described on appendix c engineers committee final report  problem #12b while the pavement design features incorporated into this regulation along with proper owner pavement maintenance will minimize this lengthening the potential for lengthening and the related potential negative impacts cannot be eliminated the design feature incorporated into these regulations which will allow for the identification and management of any potential negative impacts to improvements on private property is the placement of a total of three inches of expansion joint material within the street rightofway at each driveway apron as shown in figure a1t detail #18 figure a1u detail #19 and figure a1v detail #20 the pavement owners regular inspection every three years of the expansion material to see if the three inches of expansion material has closed up to two inches or less is required if the expansion material has closed up to two inches or less remedial action consisting of saw cutting the driveway apron next to the curb to allow for additional expansion is required the preceding is one set of proven longterm pavement management strategies that have been used on northern kentucky subdivision streets there are others that have been effective when these strategies are properly and timely executed on pavement designs in these regulations properly constructed the result should be satisfactory pavement performance for at least 50 years without pavement replacement kenton county subdivision regulations   public and private infrastructure  pavement performance and design as new more cost effective maintenance and repair strategies are developed over time they should be adopted for use 2 extending pavement life beyond 50 years figure a1aa detail #25 shows a methodology of extending pavement life that should allow most subdivision pavements properly built and maintained under these regulations to have their life extended beyond 50 years without replacement obviously many things can and likely will change over the next 50 years that will substantially change the best course of action for refurbishment or replacement of these subdivision pavements kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  purpose green infrastructure gi options  purpose 511 green infrastructure uses natural processes to ameliorate the negative effects of urban development including reducing heat island effects air pollution water pollution and excess storm water runoff integrated stormwater management is a subset of green infrastructure the use of integrated stormwater management is encouraged because of its connection to effective development practices and environmental quality the influence of the natural flow regime hydrology of a given watershed on overall stream integrity chemical physical biological is well established and as such maintaining the natural flow regime is a priority for stormwater managers the proper use of integrated stormwater management practices can achieve this goal and dramatically improve stormwater runoff quality decrease runoff volume reduce infrastructure costs protect the integrity of downstream streams and rivers and create more interesting places to live stormwater management practices include a broader understanding of watershed management and ecosystem function coupled with overall site design and layout and implementation of an impervious area reduction strategy the creation of impervious surfaces on a site can dramatically impact a communitys watersheds wastewater treatment systems and water supplies by altering the landscapes inherent ability to slow filter and absorb stormwater runoff ie alters the natural flow regime development or redevelopment of a site can be accomplished while reducing the overall negative impact to receiving streams by applying carefully considered stormwater management techniques which mimic natural hydrology to further these more general purposes this article a establishes site design components to promote more effective use of individual stormwater management techniques to prevent negative impacts rather than mitigating them  b provides the ability to utilize simple nonstructural methods for stormwater management that are lower cost and lower maintenance than structural controls  c encourages the management of stormwater as close to the point of origin as possible and minimizes collection and conveyance establishing a strategy to determine what portions of stormwater are to be filtered into the ground on site and what portions of stormwater are to flowthrough the site for management elsewhere  d provides benefits to the environment as well as to the development community by improving water quality and restoring aquatic habitats while controlling flooding this approach can increase rainfall infiltration and groundwater recharge with potentially large environmental benefits and potentially lower net costs  both to the environment and to the developer the integrated stormwater management techniques provide innovative options for developers to rethink overall site design and layout to utilize a site more efficiently while providing better stormwater management opportunities than traditional gray infrastructure  e uses multiple impervious area reduction techniques within the context of an overall site design to reduce the negative runoff impact created with the development or redevelopment of a site and ideally reduce the amount of underground pipe infrastructure necessary on a site  kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  site layout strategies f promotes the aesthetic value of integrated stormwater management in addition to the benefits of maintaining healthy waterways and the multiple environmental benefits supporting healthy communities found in the use of integrated stormwater management the use of these techniques can provide aesthetic value to a community with the use of added vegetation to the landscape by integrating natural processes into the built environment these techniques provide stormwater management flood mitigation and control and air quality management with more aesthetic appeal than standard gray stormwater infrastructure  site layout strategies 521 overall site layout strategies are encouraged to be incorporated into an integrated stormwater management plan site layout strategies are the first step in managing stormwater in a way that mimics natural hydrology using land more efficiently for development preserving critical ecological areas and reducing runoff site design are vital to maintaining a healthy watershed stormwater management works most effectively in conjunction with an overall site design strategy which identifies how the stormwater impacts created by the development will be addressed 522 a site design strategy should include identification of which portions of expected stormwater will be managed using either infiltration methods retention methods or flowshifting the focus toward the utilization of rainwater as a resource that should be managed as close to where it falls as possible and away from addressing rainwater solely as a waste that should be removed from a site will increase the efficiency of stormwater management 523 effective stormwater management will utilize multiple methods aimed at managing runoff infiltration into natural systems as well as use of management methods which remove water from the site infrastructure without adding significant impacts to local waterways and watersheds the elements work collectively to lessen the negative impacts to nearby waterways and watershed systems 524 efficiently designing a site should include conscious efforts to minimize the impervious areas created by new streets pedestrian pathways parking or buildings  elements of integrated stormwater management 531 the following elements are examples of integrated stormwater management which when used in coordination with effective site design strategies can aid in lowering the negative impact to local waterways and watersheds once a strategy has been established to minimize collection and conveyance these elements can be utilized in varying combinations to successfully implement stormwater to be filtered into the ground on site and stormwater to flowsite for management elsewhere kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management a narrower rightofway widths whether used in conjunction with narrower pavement widths or traditional width pavements narrowing the rightofway established within a site is a significant opportunity to reduce the quantity and increase the quality of storm water runoff by allowing structures to be set closer to the street because of the topography that is typical for this region many developments involve land that includes ridge tops hillside slopes and headwater streams as such development plans often include streets and structures constructed along ridge tops with back yards that extend down the hillside slopes and into headwater streams placing structures closer to the ridge top lessens the need for earthwork and tree removal along these hillside slopes which keeps more undisturbed land on the slopes and near the headwater streams in addition to the added benefit of helping to ensure hillside stability lessening hillside disturbance and tree removal will result in a lesser impact to the natural flow regime and therefore a lesser impact to water quantity and water quality in these headwater streams as well as the corresponding receiving streams downstream of the site see figure 53a figure 53a illustration of narrower rightofway widths kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management b grassy swales bioretention swales without curb and gutter and grassy swales with curb and gutter containing cutouts and flumes swales are long and narrow depressions in the landscape which incorporate vegetation to gradually move stormwater site by use of gentle slopes to guide runoff system swales are primarily used to slow the speed of stormwater runoff as it moves site though some infiltration can occur when slopes less than five percent and soils are favorable the vegetation used within swales typically requires lower ongoing maintenance than that of traditional landscaping when used in combination with curb and gutter containing cutouts and flumes the swales provide the same benefit as traditional swales without curb and gutter by collecting stormwater outside of traditional gray infrastructure associated with the site and decreasing the impacts of development to the overall manmade stormwater management system however this system offers the added benefit of providing curb and gutter along the edge of streets to help buttress asphalt pavements create a welldefined pavement edge and increase the overall pavement edge lifespan see figure 53b and figure 53c figure 53b illustration of a grassy swale without curb and gutter kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management figure 53c illustration of a grassy swale with curb and gutter c infiltration gardens biofiltration swales or rain gardens infiltration gardens are shallow depressions in the landscape which provide larger often unused or leftover areas on a site to filter stormwater into the natural soils and groundwater system use of infiltration gardens can significantly lessen the amount of stormwater collected into piping infrastructure the vegetation used within infiltration gardens typically requires lower ongoing maintenance than that of traditional landscaping see figure 53d kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management figure 53d illustration of an infiltration garden d pedestrian walkways as a design element alternative pedestrian ways which are outside of the requirements set forth in table 411 can be created to constitute a pedestrian circulation system equal to the level of effectiveness that traditional sidewalk on one or both sides of the street would provide rather than including sidewalks only within the rightofway along the street integrating a well thought out pedestrian circulation system throughout a site can reduce impervious surface while potentially lowering the construction cost and raising the stormwater management benefits of the overall site incorporating a strategic system of pedestrian walkways linking key destinations within a site in conjunction with aligning connections for travel outside the site will increase usability of walkway networks additionally incorporating materials such as mulch gravel or other pervious material can further reduce the hard surface runoff when adding sidewalks to one or both sides of every street often important pedestrian connections are not made the sidewalks themselves are under ifatall utilized and excessive impervious surfaces are created kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management figure 53e illustration of pedestrian walkways as a design element e planter boxes planters are long narrow often rectangular landscaped areas with vertical walls and flat unsloped bottoms and are able to store a greater volume of water than swales because they are typically deeper and provide more capacity water flows into the planter absorbs into the topsoil and plants fills to a predetermined overflow elevation and discharges into the overflow system provided two types of planters are used for stormwater management 1 flowflowhave a sealed bottom and sides and absorb only as much water as the soil and plants in the planter can accommodate they allow water to slowly travel soil profile prior to overflowing into a subsurface underdrain system see figure 53f kenton county subdivision regulations   green infrastructure gi options  elements of integrated stormwater management figure 53f

into the natural ground water system while still providing the structural integrity necessary for the sites automobile and pedestrian traffic the use of permeable pavement can mitigate the overall impact of the development to the piping infrastructure systems while maintaining full functionality of the developed site see figure 53h figure 53i and figure 53j figure 53h illustration of permeable

rainwater trees naturally work to physically slow the flow of water site by intercepting stormwater on their leaf surfaces as well as root structure not only do trees collect water for their growth their physical presence on the landscape intercepts the flow of water downhill and slows its movement see figure 53k figure 53k illustration of preserving existing trees and planting new trees kenton

report to the kenton county planning commission from the kenton county street standards engineers committee ssec members mark brueggemann pe  joe kramer pe  jim viox pe  ted vogelpohl pe  henry fischer chairman background in 2008 the kenton county planning commission kcpc initiated an effort to update the kenton county subdivision regulations as a part of the update process input was solicited from various interested groups in kenton county among those responding the kenton county mayors group the kenton county judge executive the land development council of the home builders association of northern kentucky hbanky and the northern kentucky society of professional engineers nkspe were particularly active in their response by mid2013 there was consensus agreement among the interested groups and the kcpc staff on most parts of the updated draft regulations the area where there remained substantial disagreement among the parties mentioned above was that part of the regulation draft that dealt with requirements for future subdivision street pavements during the late stages of this community discussion at the suggestion of the kenton county judge executive and several city mayors and authorization of the planning commission chairman a committee of five local pavement professionals with over 150 years of collective experience in the design construction reconstruction and maintenance of subdivision pavements was formed and took on the name of kenton county street standards engineers committee ssec the committee members are listed above this committee was asked as a voluntary community service to do the following analyze existing subdivision pavement performance evaluate that performance compared to reasonable expectations for pavement performance and make recommendations that would improve pavement customer value in future subdivision pavements all earlier community discussion on pavement performance was to be considered as input into their process the committee established a problem analysis and decision making approach with the objective of providing kenton county subdivision pavement customers home purchaserowner home occupant taxpayer citizen maximized longterm pavement value over the course of a year the committee met for two hour meetings normally twice weekly to generate their analysis and recommendations in addition there were meetings and conversations with many other individuals and groups seeking their advice input and consensus agreement those groups included  the kenton county planning commission subdivision regulations committee  kenton county planning commission  kenton county mayors group subdivision regulation review committee  various northern kentucky city and county engineers  various northern kentucky city and county public works officials  brian wood pe  executive director of plantmix asphalt industry of kentucky  local concrete and asphalt producers  local subdivision improvement contractors  the northern kentucky society of professional engineers continuing education session feb 24 2014 kenton county subdivision regulations   appendix c engineers committee final report recommendations for improvement in the kenton county subdivision regulation street standards the following represents the consensus problem identification and recommendations for improvement in kenton county subdivision street regulations by the ssec besides many hours of analysis and discussion by our committee input into the analysis and decision making process was solicited received and considered from a broad spectrum of those involved in the design construction and maintenance of subdivision streets especially those who have been involved in the kcpc subdivision regulation update process in addition many sources from the professional pavement design and maintenance literature were considered and used it is noteworthy that the recommendations contained in this report are the unanimous recommendations of the members of the ssec the ssec hereby respectfully requests that the kcpc accept the following analysis and incorporate these recommendations into the revised subdivision regulation street standards now under their consideration problem identification realistic problem solving requires accurate definition of the problems and their root causes that is the aim of the following as it relates to problems in existing kenton county subdivision pavements and improvements for the design and regulation of future pavements the following is a list of the most critical problems and opportunities for improvement that have been identified in kenton county subdivision pavements installed from roughly 1985 28 years old to 2000 13 years old the significance of 1985 is that in 198 there was a substantial effort by the northern kentucky engineering homebuilding and local government community to improve new subdivision pavement performance this 1985 effort resulted in a substantial upgrade and standardization of subdivision pavement regulations across northern kentucky including kenton county the subdivision pavements built from 1985 to 2000 in kenton county were built under those 1985 regulations there was little to no change in the pavement regulations during that period jim viox henry fischer and thelen associates inc george thelen then and ted vogelpohl now have been participants in both the 1985 update effort and this current update effort this continuity has benefitted this current effort greatly it is also noteworthy that very significant improvements in pavement performance and citizen homeowner taxpayer pavement value resulted from that 1985 effort hopefully as much or more value can be gained from this current effort problems common to asphalt and concrete pavement 1 pavement performance standards are not clear in the current regulations pavement design parameters performance expectations and procedures for and the importance of proper pavement maintenance are not set out this has often resulted in unclear and unrealistic expectations for pavement performance and maintenance within the kenton county community 2 quality assurance efforts in pavement construction in some cases have been lacking leading to premature pavement failure related to this problem is the fact that some construction and material specifications in the current subdivision regulations are inadequate to insure quality pavement performance in other instances the existing regulations dont provide an adequate description of material and construction specification tolerances that can be achieved using good material control and construction practices this lack of proper tolerances leads to ambiguity confusion and arbitrary decision making during construction on what the acceptable material and construction standards are various aspects of this quality assurance kenton county subdivision regulations   appendix c engineers committee final report effort are the responsibility of the developers the design and geotechnical engineers the construction contractor and the kcpc and its designated inspection agency 3 in many cases subdivision streets in kenton county communities have not been adequately maintained by their owners thus shortening pavement life and substantially increasing ultimate customer longterm pavement costs 4 there is no consideration given in existing regulations pavement design of how to extend pavement life beyond the 20 year design life 5 subgrade strength is in some cases being degraded because of water penetrating into and weakening the subgrade there is a need for improvement in the drainage characteristics of subdivision pavements both surface and subsurface  there are design shortfalls as well as construction quality control and maintenance shortfalls this problem is much more critical in asphalt pavements because of asphalts high reliance on subgrade strength as compared to concretes reliance on uniform subgrade support 6 pavement failures caused by utility ditch settlement under the street this is a more costly per occurrence but less frequent problem for concrete pavements 7 existing subdivision regulation standards for streets in industrial and commercial subdivisions are often inadequate for the heavy truck traffic loading these streets must support problems specific to asphalt street pavements 8 when asphalt pavements came into common use in kenton county in the early 1990s there was a failure to recognize and address the fact that asphalt pavements are more dependent on subgrade strength than concrete pavements often there was an assumption that subgrade strength that was good enough for concrete was good enough for asphalt this isnt true this assumption led to some asphalt pavement failures caused by inadequate subgrade preparation andor inadequate subgrade materials 9 asphalt pavement subgrade weakening caused by inadequate pavement surface and subsurface storm water management root causes include inadequate subgrade and surface cross slope both in design and inadequate quality control  water penetrating the asphaltcurb apron interface due to the asphalt being finished below the curb apron  inadequate curb apron cross slope to the gutter line  the asphalt subgrade being cut lower than the adjacent curb subgrade thus trapping water under the asphalt  water penetrating the subgrade from the area outside the curb  and inadequate sealing and maintenance of the asphaltcurb apron interface another problem in this area relates to the improper use of more brittle asphalt materials designed specifically for highway use when more brittle asphalt materials are used in subdivision pavements premature surface cracks develop in the body of the pavement allowing water to penetrate pavement into the subgrade and accelerating deterioration of the pavement subgrade 10 there are inadequate quality assurance requirements in the current regulations for asphalt material and no asphalt inplace density requirements or testing 11 in some limited cases there have been excessive premature asphalt street concrete curb and gutter failures some causes include improper or inadequate isolation joints at structures catch basins  inadequate curb cross section bending strength andor inadequate subgrade support  and inadequate concrete material quality leading to dcracking and other freezethaw concrete deterioration kenton county subdivision regulations   appendix c engineers committee final report problems specific to concrete street pavements 12 premature pavement failures caused by inplace concrete not being resistant enough to natural multiyear freezethaw and expansioncontraction cycles causes include a concrete mixes coarse aggregate type and cement content that are not resistant enough to concrete dcracking and the use of appropriate deicers note that some inappropriate deicers will cause concrete deterioration even with appropriate concrete mixes the dcracking problem leads to deterioration at the joints as well as total concrete failure in the body of the concrete slabs b excessive concrete street lengthening or growth problems that are caused by the use of expansion joints in the pavement expansive gravel 57s coarse aggregate premature load transfer failures at contraction joints joint seal failure and poor maintenance another pavement condition that can contribute to the problem is where pavement lengthening is relatively unrestricted such as at the end of downhill culdesacs measures to manage potential pavement growth impacts on private property outside of the pavement can also be improved 13 premature contraction joint load transfer failure which causes rough vehicle ride and eventual slab failure this problem is caused by the separation of the contraction joints due to the use of expansion joints and more recently since 1990 by the use of substantial amounts of #8 gravel in pavement concrete mixes the addition of #8 gravel and corresponding reduction in 57s gravel decreases the percentage of total aggregate above  in size and thus decreases the aggregate interlock across the contraction joint inadequate joint seal maintenance is another contributing factor to this problem this type failure also contributes significantly to concrete problems described in number 12 above recommendation objective the most serious and improvable existing subdivision pavement problems have been identified along with their root causes the objective now is to find solutions to those problems that yield the pavement customer house purchaser home owner occupant taxpayer citizen the lowest possible 50 year net present value for the pavement life cycle costs net present value accounts for the time value of money which is the basis for evaluating any pavement option initial construction costs pavement joint maintenance localized failure repair and resurfacing costs are the primary life cycle costs 50 years was selected as the reasonable period to evaluate pavement use performance and maintenance it is anticipated that the life of most subdivision pavements as designed here can be extended beyond 50 years when properly constructed and maintained with additional refurbishment and repair some time after 50 years the following committee recommendations are consistent with this preceding objective note that local suburban subdivision streets which represent the bulk of subdivision streets built in kenton county are used as examples in many of these recommendations and exhibits these recommendations are easily adapted to other classes of subdivision streets recommendations 1 for all engineering material and construction specifications in the subdivision regulations including those recommended herein establish realistically achievable definitions including allowable variances and tolerances benefit meeting this objective will substantially help clarification of pavement expectations for all involved in the subdivision process it will also help minimize ambiguity and arbitrary decision making on asconstructed pavement variances in the future kenton county subdivision regulations   appendix c engineers committee final report 2 include a pavement performance and design section in the subdivision regulations that sets out a 20year design life and 50year life cycle maintenance and resurfacing plan also include other subdivision regulation pavement design parameters the proper expectations for pavement performance the differences in performance characteristics between asphalt and concrete the need for maintenance and other related subjects figure c1aexhibit a contains the ssec parameter selection and example design calculations for subdivision pavements exhibit b contains the ssec 50year life cycle expected minimum maintenance requirements benefit addresses problem #1 and helps address problems #3 and #4 3 after revised regulations are adopted establish an effort whereby a group of local engineers contractors developers and governmental officials collaborate to improve the governmental pavement construction inspection program the focus should be to determine those factors or items that are most important to be inspected to insure proper pavement performance then once those factors are determined train inspection personnel how to inspect those factors and document those inspections the formation of a longer term inspection oversight group should also be considered benefit addresses problem #2 4 suggest to the kenton county mayors group that a pavement management system such as the one used currently by the city of florence would be a good idea for implementation in kenton county properly implemented this type of system will significantly improve longterm customer pavement value benefit helps solve problem #3 5 adopt a structural subgrade strength minimum for the standard subdivision pavement design of cbr   2 or greater for concrete and cbr   3 or greater for asphalt require site specific improvements in design and construction of the subgrade andor pavement by a registered engineer where these cbr requirements cant be met with the proposed subdivisions natural soils and proper compaction benefit help address problems 5 and 8 6 adopt a requirement for geotechnical reports regarding pavement design and subgrade support at multiple stages of subdivision approval as described in exhibit c these reports will also address other important soil slope stability and structural issues benefit assures adequate subgrade structural support for pavements helps address problems 5 and 8 7 establish minimum subdivision regulation pavement design for industrial and commercial subdivisions with stated design parameters including esal loading require planned traffic esal loading analysis by a registered engineer for all commercial and industrial subdivisions where planned traffic loading exceeds standard design loading or where minimum required cbrs are not met require the necessary improvements in pavement design and construction see exhibit a for proposed industrialcommercial pavement designs benefit solves problem #7 8 increase subgrade cross slope from the current 2% use a subgrade cross slope of 3% for

exhibit e and exhibit f benefit helps solve problems 5 and 9 10 use concrete sloped curb see exhibit e and eliminate use of current concrete rolled curb kenton county subdivision regulations   appendix c engineers committee final report benefit helps solve problems 4 and 11 and improves vehicle ride when accessing driveways 11 use odot 6 chair back curb or equivalent instead of ktc 6 vertical curb allow horizontally sawed driveway apron cuts in this curb type benefit the odot curb is more approachable when parking a car adjacent to the curb and less likely to damage wheel rims 12 require that the front top edge of the sidewalk along the street be constructed 6 +1 above the top of sloped curb see exhibit g benefit help solve problem #4 by allowing for future significant asphalt overlays while still maintaining adequate street drainage see exhibit h 13 require edge drains along all curb lines as depicted in exhibit d exhibit e and exhibit f benefit helps solve problems 5 and 9 14 require that telephone and electric crossovers under the street and three feet beyond the street to be installed as follows separate the parallel ducts by at least 2 horizontally using spacers  cover with 6 of fill sand  properly compact with a vibratory plate compactor  add additional conduit as necessary properly separated cover with fill sand properly compacted backfill remaining trench with ktc dense grade aggregate dga properly compacted up to subgrade see exhibit g other shallow utility ditches under the pavement other than those described in 15 below are to be similarly bedded covered and backfilled benefit helps solve problem #6 15 require storm catch basins and catch basin storm crossovers to be bedded covered backfilled and drained into one catch basin as depicted on exhibit h make sure 57s crushed stone is exposed to the base of the pavement properly compact all materials benefit helps solve problems 5 6 and 9 16 adopt subdivision street classifications including number of lots served street width subgrade slope pavement thicknesses and curb type as shown in exhibit i benefit helps solve problems 1 4 5 and 9 17 adopt the standard of always having the pavement base course whether stonebased or fulldepth asphalt extend under the curb as shown in exhibit d and exhibit e benefit allows for the required use of a 24inch wide curb instead of the current standard 30inch wide curb and helps solve problems 5 9 and 11 18 adopt asphalt material standards which more narrowly define those ktc asphalt material standards which are appropriate for residential subdivision pavements set out testing requirements for asphalt aggregate and liquid asphalt content also establish density testing requirements for inplace pavement use ktc crushed stone base material for stonebased pavements require regular reporting and passing results of ktc gradation requirement from base material sources benefit helps solve problems #2 and #10 19 for asphalt pavements increase the cross slope of the apron of the 24 concrete curb and gutter section to 6% see exhibit d and exhibit e require the asphalt surface at the apron to be finished 14 + 18 above the apron and properly sealed benefit helps solve problems 5 and 9 20 install finish course of asphalt no later than one year from the date of installation of the asphalt base and intermediate course see exhibit d and exhibit e when the finish course of asphalt is installed kenton county subdivision regulations   appendix c engineers committee final report immediately as a part of initial construction asphalt base material may be substituted for intermediate base material benefit insures that asphalt streets are completed on a timely basis 21 specify concrete mixes used for concrete pavements to have six bags of cement per cubic yard require all large aggregates above #8s to be crushed limestone require that #4 limestone be included in the pavement mix a maximum aggregate size of 57s is appropriate for concrete curb and gutter require ktc approval of hardness requirements for crushed limestone aggregate sources see exhibit j for secc recommended concrete aggregate content and a discussion of the importance of large aggregate size in concrete pavement benefit helps solve problems 12 and 13 22 eliminate expansion joints in concrete pavements use skewed contraction joints as shown in exhibit k place contraction joints at a maximum spacing of 15 oc benefit helps solve problems 12 and 13 23 for concrete pavements provide 3 of expansion joint material in the driveway apron area within the right of way see exhibit l to provide for the management of any concrete pavement growth that does occur inspect placement when inspecting driveway apronsidewalk construction citycounty street maintenance personnel will monitor any closing of expansion joints as a part of normal street maintenance and take appropriate action benefit provides for management of street growth problems outside of the pavement when they do occur problem #12b 24 use pavement lugs in concrete pavement as shown in exhibit m to help minimize potential pavement growth in critical pavement geometric conditions these critical conditions which are identified in exhibit n and exhibit o have historically been the pavement geometric conditions where subdivision pavement growth problems have been more likely to occur benefit this should help mitigate the problem described in problem #12b 25 the kcpc should consider the merits of replacing the current culdesac design with the hamilton county teardrop culdesac design see exhibit p benefit this teardrop design might make turn around for public service vehicles easier than the current design the preceding represents our group consensus problem identification and recommendations for improvement in future kenton county subdivision pavements demonstration projects as a part of the seccs work they solicited and received the cooperation from three local developers arlinghaus drees and fischer several local governmental entities local construction contractors and material suppliers in the construction of several pavement demonstration projects these demonstration projects were built in 12 different new subdivision sections throughout northern kentucky during the period of september 2012  the purpose of these demonstration projects was to evaluate the constructability ease of quality control cost andto the extent possibleprobable longterm performance characteristics of various material specifications construction methods and construction details included among the tested alternatives were many of the final recommendations of this report which have been suggested for adoption in the revised subdivision regulations for kenton county there were also alternatives tested that were not used in the seccs final recommendations these demonstration projects greatly enhanced the confidence of the ssec in their final recommendations kenton

critical parts of recommendations number 7 8 9 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 20 21 22 23 and 24 conclusion the recommendations for improvement are in the areas of design construction standards construction quality control and maintenance of pavements which are interdependent and all necessary to insure good homeownertaxpayer pavement value the secc also recognizes that proper pavement performance expectation setting for all involved in the regulation design construction and maintenance of subdivision pavements is a critical component of obtaining good pavement value hopefully our work here will help improve communication in this regard our work on problem definition and recommendations is now complete we now respectfully ask the commission to accept our work product and have your staff help us incorporate this work product into the current kenton county draft subdivision regulations which will be considered for adoption by the kcpc at public hearing thank you for your consideration

specific subgrade support the city of cincinnatis list of qualified geotechnical engineers will be used as the base approved list for geotechnical engineers with the ability of kcpc to add to or delete from that list the following steps will be taken a at the preliminary subdivision plan stage the geotechnical engineer will use his local soils knowledge usgs soils mapping and a visual field reconnaissance to report on the likelihood of soils on that specific site meeting the minimum cbr values for subgrade the report will also include observations relative to the sites suitability for building support b at construction drawing submittal the geotechnical engineer will submit a report on the soil types the expected cbr of those soil types that exist on that section of lots being submitted or possibly on the subdivision as a whole this submittal will also include information on other issues of structural subsurface stability for proposed subdivision public land improvements planned for the site these judgments will be based on the results of soil borings open trench exploration soil testing etc that are sufficient for the geotechnical engineer to render his engineering opinion c during mass earthwork subgrade materials will be evaluated as to their meeting required densities and as to the subgrade materials being used being capable of producing the cbr required to meet the base subdivision street design when compacted to the required densities reports as to these results will be submitted by the geotechnical engineer to the kcpc prior to the installation of pavement if subgrade soils are substandard remedial subgradepavement enhancement will be designed and submitted to kcpc d prior to pavement being installed the subgrade will be tested for density
