communication while maintaining a safe environment and attractive visual appearance within the city by specifying criteria for all signage this division is intended to serve the following purposes 1 maintain the established smalltown character within the citys historic district while accounting for the citys suburban and urban growth outside the historic district by regulating all exterior signage in a manner that is consistent with promoting such goals 2 protect and maintain the visual integrity of roadway corridors within the city by establishing a maximum amount of signage on any one site to reduce visual clutter 3 establish locations and setbacks for signage that are designed to protect motorists from visual distractions obstructions and hazards 4 enhance the appearance of the physical environment by requiring that signage be designed as an integral architectural feature of the site and structure for which such signage is intended to identify and be located in a manner that is sensitive to the existing natural environment 5 provide for signage that satisfies the needs of the local business community for visibility identification and communication 6 establish procedures for the removal or replacement of nonconforming signs enforcement of these regulations maintenance of existing signs and consideration of variances and appeals 7 facilitate clear communication of messages 8 reduce hazards to the health safety or welfare of the public 9 prevent signs that may mislead or confuse the public b the regulation of signs as provided herein is based upon their function and is not based upon the content of the message contained on any such sign the florida constitution provides that it is the policy of the state to conserve and protect its scenic beauty and the regulation of signage for purposes of aesthetics directly serves that policy in order to preserve the city as a desirable community in which to live visit and do business a pleasing visually attractive environment is of foremost importance the regulation of signs within the city is a highly contributive means by which to achieve this desired end these sign regulations are prepared with the intent of enhancing the smalltown environment and promoting the continued wellbeing of the city the enhancement of the visual environment is critical to a communitys image and safety and the sign control principles set forth herein create a sense of character and ambiance that distinguishes the city as one with a commitment to maintaining and improving an attractive and safe environment the city council recognizes that there are various persons and entities that have an interest in communicating with the public use of signs that serve to identify businesses and services residences and neighborhoods and also to provide for expression of opinions the council is also responsible for furthering the citys obligation to its residents and visitors to maintain a safe and aesthetically pleasing environment where signs do not create excessive visual clutter and distraction or hazards for pedestrians and vehicles  where signs do not adversely impact the smalltown character of the citys historic district or the suburban and urban growth outside of the historic district  and where signs do not conflict with the natural and scenic qualities of the city it is the intent of the council that the regulations contained in this division shall provide a uniform sign criteria that regulates the size height number and placement of signs in a manner that is compatible with the unique qualities of the various zoning districts and which shall place the fewest possible restrictions on personal liberties property rights free commerce and the free exercise of constitutional rights all while achieving the citys goal of creating a safe healthy attractive and aesthetically pleasing environment that does not contain excessive clutter or visual distraction from rightofways and adjacent properties the surrounding natural environment and residential neighborhoods c findings of fact the city council finds that 1 the manner of the erection location and maintenance of signs affects the public health safety or welfare of the people in this community and the general public 2 the safety of motorists cyclists pedestrians other users of the public streets is affected by the number size location lighting and movement of signs that divert an individuals attention 3 the size and location of signs may if uncontrolled constitute an obstacle to effective firefighting techniques and other emergency management services 4 the construction erection and maintenance of large signs suspended from or placed on the tops of buildings walls or other structures may constitute a direct danger to pedestrian and vehicular traffic below especially during periods of strong winds such as those caused by hurricanes and central florida thunderstorms 5 uncontrolled and unlimited signs may degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of the citys smalltown character within the historic district and suburban or urban growth outside the historic district d substitution clause it is not the intent of this division to afford greater protection to commercial speech than to noncommercial speech any commercial sign display or device allowed under this division may contain any lawful noncommercial message that complies with all other requirements applicable to the sign the noncommercial message may occupy the entire display area or any portion thereof and may substitute for or be combined with the commercial message provided that the sign is not prohibited and continues to comply with all requirements of this division thus notwithstanding any provisions that may be interpreted to the contrary this division allows a sign containing noncommercial copy to the same extent as a sign containing commercial copy e with respect to any definitions names or descriptions throughout the land development code that attempt to define a particular type of sign such is merely for the

and standards contained elsewhere in the land development code the standards in this division shall prevail development aspects not covered by these standards shall be governed by the standards contained elsewhere in the land development code b purpose 1 the standards are intended to enable creation of functional mixed use communities consisting of pedestrian and transitoriented centers of commerce and employment that support and are supported by walkable residential neighborhoods 2 the following planning principles serve as a guide for interpreting and implementing the standards contained herein the principles are the basis for the citys mixed use policies and they are organized by the scale at which they are functionally relevant a community scale principles 1 neighborhoods and centers are compact pedestrianoriented and transitaccessible places designed to reduce overreliance on automotive based travel 2 centers having a mix of uses are the primary urban form for accommodating commercial office industrial and institutional development special districts established to accommodate a single use are the exception 3 ordinary activities are conveniently accessible by walking or transit allowing independence to those who cannot or choose not to drive 4 interconnected networks of streets are designed to disperse traffic and reduce the length of automobile trips 5 a range of housing types and price levels is available within neighborhoods to accommodate diverse ages and incomes 6 transit supportive building densities and land uses are provided within walking distance of transit stops 7 civic public and private institutional and commercial activities are embedded in mixed use centers not isolated in remote singleuse complexes 8 a range of civic spaces including parks squares and playgrounds are distributed within neighborhoods and centers b block and building scale principles 1 buildings and landscaping contribute to the physical definition of streets as public spaces 2 development respects the pedestrian and the spatial form of public areas while adequately accommodating the automobile 3 the design of streets and buildings reinforces safe pedestrian environments with building frontages oriented to the street 4 a visual scale is established for each center and neighborhood and coordinated consistent application of building form standards 5 civic buildings and public gathering places are provided at locations that reinforce community identity 6 civic buildings are distinctive and appropriate to their role of importance within the community c concept plans and site development plans 1 the comprehensive plan directs that a implementation of the conceptual master plan for a mixed use district be preparation and approval of a concept plan and site development plan  and b adjustments to a conceptual master plan shall become final of concept plans and site development plans 2 the comprehensive plan further prescribes policies that these standards are intended to implement which include a the build out of lands within a mixed use district should occur in a manner that is predictable but also flexible  and b uses densities and intensities in a mixed use district shall be allowed to change over time evolving in order to realize buildout targets 3 for a mixed use district designated as a multimodal transportation district mmtd the city will review and approve concept plans and site development plans consistent with the following principles among other principles a within a mmtd a concept plan or a development order if the concept plan also functions as a detailed specific area plan dsap pursuant to fs   may vary by up to 25 percent from the overall densities and intensities dictated by a conceptual master plan in establishing densities and intensities under this provision the following shall apply 1 the concept plan shall identify the proposed densities and intensities by reference to affected centers and neighborhoods the proposed program shall be evaluated based on i the development programs consistency with the flue mixeduse policies  and ii the projects enabling of transit jobs creation and walkability within the districts urban and community centers 2 development within urban employment community and neighborhood centers or within onequarter mile of rail stations stations along bus rapid transit routes in exclusive busonly lanes andor transit superstops having diminished densities and intensities shall be developed to allow evolution of the developments to original densities and intensities the site development plan shall clearly illustrate how this will be accomplished series of site designs showing the sequence of development activity over time 3 project designs will incorporate the walkability principles contained in these standards and maintain consistency with mmtd policies adopted for the area d the remainder of this division is organized as follows 1 public realm standards this section presents design specifications for establishing and creating public spaces which include streetscapes and civic spaces 2 place type functions this section directs different types of activities or uses to the appropriate place type consistent with its defined function minimum percentages of uses within a place type are set forth for the purpose of ensuring a robust mixture of compatible activities  1exh a 5142015   place type function a regulation of place type function the requirements of this section regulate place type functions by establishing broad categories of use and requiring their coordination with the building forms required to be identified in each site development plan use categories provide a systematic basis for combining mutually supportive and complementary activities so they can be managed appropriately the intent is not to limit uses but to allocate them to the appropriate place types use requirements are

the first purpose is to set aside an area for activities providing an essential function but which should not or cannot be mixed with other types of development because of their operations or expansive space needs these include industrial operations airports correctional facilities cemeteries distribution centers production facilities and major public utilities the second purpose is to accommodate an economic catalyst special districts established for this second purpose are to be limited in number and in size so as not to undermine the economic viability of a districts employment

active recreation numerous plazas and greens add to the vibrancy of centers and neighborhoods by creating the opportunity for casual public engagement building frontages define the space pocket plazas function in a similar manner and follow the same rules as the larger plazas these smaller scaled spaces create more intimate places for seating or dining and provide a place where commercial and neighborhood activity can spill into these plazas can also be used to create a formal space in front of a prominent building entrance 2 character plazas and greens are purposefully sited gathering

 narcoossee community development intent and standards   open space a framework the open space framework builds on existing recreational amenities such as east lake tohopekaliga the split oak forest conservation park chisholm park lake runnymede conservation area and the narcoossee community center and is focused on the preservation of existing resources wildlife corridors and habitat areas a primary regional trail system links these existing amenities with new planned parks and cultural amenities secondary offstreet trails will connect neighborhoods to this primary regional trail system and detached sidewalks and bike lanes along road rightsofway will serve as local connections throughout the narcoossee area parks open space and trails increase quality of life and can enhance property values in narcoossee and throughout the region the preservation of open space and natural resources ensures a sustainable ecosystem for narcoossees diverse vegetation and wildlife species trail systems allow a higher quality of life for residences and offer offstreet transportation options and recreational opportunities that could extend into orange county south to lake lizzie natural area and eventually to harmony open space standards and trails are addressed in more detail in of the land development are identified on map  sic b open space goals and objectives the open space guidelines are needed to preserve the natural resources of the area while allowing for recreational uses throughout and are oriented towards four primary objectives  preserve the natural resources of the area   create destinations for recreation   establish an efficient and safe trail system to connect these destinations  and  serve a range of users including hikers bicyclists and equestrians c open space overall context the western edge of the narcoossee study area is bounded by east lake tohopekaliga and fells cove and their associated wetlands many additional lakes including lake runnymede center lake and hinden lake are scattered throughout the area connected by largescale wetlands systems much of the narcoossee community is heavily vegetated with wetlands and forested areas while many of these natural areas are smaller and disconnected west of narcoossee road eastern areas boast large expanses of undisturbed wetland forests d open space opportunities 1 preservation of natural resources preservation of the natural systems for the narcoossee community is considered a core community value built on the wetland system this natural framework helps maintain the open rural feeling opportunities are present for each landowner to be a steward of the natural resources for their property other opportunities exist to connect these sensitive areas with additional upland corridors so wildlife can move freely area wildlife corridors have been planned on adjacent mixed use districts these wildlife corridors could make connections all the way from east lake tohopekaliga to the econlockhatchee river these areas will serve additional functions including interpretation  preserving water quality detention and retention  and simply reinforcing character features key areas of opportunity include  wetlands  sensitive wildlife areas  floodplain areas  upland wildlife corridors  historic areas  public lands  water bodies 2 open space parks and greenway networks preservation of natural systems is important to the character of the narcoossee area and the benefits of this are described throughout this section these areas also provide the framework for a greenway parks and trail system linking the community together within a natural fabric as demonstrated in the open space framework map in chapter 4 new parks the historic town the narcoossee elementary and middle schools and public lands are planned and connected into one system key opportunities include  regional park system and facilities  lakeside parks  public plazas  community gardens  beach areas with marinaboat slips and water access  recreation center  playgrounds  tree preservation 3 multiuse trails adjacent to natural features and greenways is a system of multimodal trails these trails provide an appropriate buffer between sensitive resources and adjacent development these trails allow for equestrian use walking and biking trails have been located in strategic areas including within mixed use areas along existing streets and adjacent to natural features new trails in the narcoossee community provide the opportunity to achieve the following  reinforce the character by promoting a historically used transportation system   buffer new development with a recreation amenity   create a new mobility option that supports equestrian walking and biking   connect neighborhoods with trail systems to the historic town schools centers and regional destinations such as the split oak mitigation park and the econlockhatchee river   provide safe and healthy options for seniors and our youth   create a new offstreet trail amenity that helps mitigate the impact of busy roads a trailheads trailheads are public places to enter and exit a trail facility and often include signage informal kiosks with trail maps and trash receptacles there are three types of trailheads trailheads with parking trailheads with equestrian trailer parking and nonparking access points trailheads that offer parking are typically near heavily utilized trails the amount of parking offered at these trailheads is dependent on trail usage and available space nonparking access points are typically located on lesserused trail systems following are the elements that should be located at each trailhead  signage rules and regulations shall be located at all trailheads and shall include trail etiquette warnings about potential safety hazards and permitted trail uses  trash receptacles trash cans shall be located at all citymaintained trailheads and shall be placed along heavily used trails within the narcoossee area  dog waste disposal stations on trails where dogs are allowed dog waste stations shall be provided at onemile intervals and at trailheads  shade structures where possible shade structures shall be located at heavily utilized trailheads to offer relief from the sun and shelter from inclement weather  lighting in areas likely to receive use at night pathway lighting meeting dark sky standards shall be provided to avoid conflicts at intersections and allow users to better observe trail direction surface conditions and obstacles  restrooms where possible restrooms shall be present at heavily utilized trailheads b trail crossings trail crossings shall always be located perpendicular to the roadway and shall be clearly marked crossings are encouraged to be located at signalized intersections especially at major roadway crossings if this is not feasible a trailuser activated flashing yellow light shall be used at the crossing these crossings shall also be striped or utilize different paving methods to alert drivers to trail crossing locations on local streets trail crossings may be signed with only a stop sign  1exh b 5142015   separators the narcoossee area has a number of character areas consisting of traditional subdivisions to rural estates the community has acknowledged that portions of the community will continue to grow new mixed use districts are already expected in the area in these transitioning areas separators transitions and connections can increase the compatibility of all future projects these techniques come in many forms from simply preserving and buffering natural features adjacent to new developments to promoting compatible densities on the edge of a development although one technique is to create a separation between developments another technique is to connect them by connecting existing neighborhoods to new neighborhoods the difference between the two developments are lessened through greenway park trail and street connections separate developments appear to be one development with a variety of housing types residents benefit from shared amenities and new transportation choices key actions and opportunities include  preserve and buffer natural features such as wetlands forested areas and water bodies  create setbacks and separation of uses  utilize physical features such as

such as sidewalks and fencing shall also be utilized as separators between incompatible developments e land use solutions land use options such as cluster development and transitioning densities at the edges of existing residential areas can help maintain the narcoossee community character additionally connections between existing and new residential neighborhoods using greenways and trail systems andor local street connections can also help mitigate undesirable elements such as larger roads and additional traffic  1exh b 5142015   centers framework the economic development framework for narcoossee highlights opportunities for consolidating expanding and creating new commercial areas along the narcoossee corridor and interior to new walkable neighborhoods the centers framework is identified on map 312b below at the heart of the narcoossee corridor is the historic town this area will serve as the community and cultural center for residents of the area at the south end of the corridor lies the existing retail center anchored by publix with the opportunity for continued expansion along us highway 102 this area could serve as an employment base for the community two additional future community centers lie at the intersections of narcoossee road and cyrils drive and narcoossee road and rummell road these centers are anticipated to contain a mix of retail and small businesses to complement the southern commercial and employment center additional future neighborhoodscale centers occur along narcoossee road at boggy creek road tompkins drive and chisholm park trail additional neighborhood centers also occur interior to the residential developments within the narcoossee community a centers overall context the historic town will establish a focus and identity for the narcoossee community and will center around what could be considered historic narcoossee at the northeast corner of narcoossee road and jones road this area sites almost at the geographical center for the narcoossee community already contains the historic fire station and most lots are already divided into smaller parcels and zoned commercial which is more applicable to development of a small downtown area the narcoossee feed store at the northwest corner of narcoossee and jones roads should be preserved as well it is recommended the st lukes missionary baptist church currently further east on jones road be relocated to the historic town the preservation of remaining historic buildings and structures in narcoossee is an important consideration in establishing the historic town this may involve the preservation and in some case physical relocation of historic buildings such as the narcoossee feed store the narcoossee schoolhouse st lukes missionary baptist church the volunteer fire department and other historic buildings and structures in the area the economic development framework for narcoossee highlights opportunities for consolidating expanding and creating new commercial areas along the narcoossee corridor and interior to new walkable neighborhoods b centers opportunities residents do not want narcoossee road to suffer a similar fate as other corridors in the region instead of typical strip commercial development a series of appropriately spaced and sized neighborhood and commercial centers will be developed these walkable unique centers will range from coffee shops to mixed use office complexes to new local restaurants in key places they will be surrounded by smaller residential units creating new complete neighborhoods centers located in the mixed use districts will be adjacent to higher density development a 2011 market analysis infers that longterm market demand exceeds the amount of zoned commercial and employment land due to high traffic counts along narcoossee road and anticipated regional growth these underscaled vibrant centers could experience high retail expenditure per square foot promoting needed but tempered economic development the existing commercial big box center at highway 192 could be expected to transition to a mixed use area over time if adjacent residential densities are increased key opportunities include  creation of lakefront retail areas  redevelopment of the community center at highway 192  creation of centers with senior living components local restaurants and services c historic town opportunities 1 employment areas opportunities residents have expressed interest in new local jobs when asked the question will my children live in the community when they grow older the majority answered no a primary reason is the lack of highpaying jobs most residents work outside the area one method to minimize the impacts of growth is providing employment options closer to where people live new employment areas are planned in the centers mixed use areas or as a separation between the narcoossee community and the northeast district these businesses will provide new employment options to the residents key opportunities include  new hightechnology research facilities due to the proximity to medical city and the northeast district  office uses creating appropriate entryways into the area  sustainable industries that are consistent with the areas values 2 investment in historic town opportunities residents have chosen to restore and expand the historic gathering place of the community historic town will include mixed use commercial buildings against the street a smallblock quaint downtown event area and the stabilization and enhancement of the adjacent residential neighborhoods the development of historic town is expected to achieve the following goals  creation of a gateway into the community and osceola county  definition of the character and sense of place of the community  creation of a central public gathering area and event areas  provision of a center for local economic development  provision of a local and regional recreational resource focused on equestrian amenities  provision of a cultural center for the community including a museum art local food production and historic buildings  provision of transit station options key opportunities include  welldesigned architectural details  restaurants  library andor community centers  churches andor meeting areas  public greens plazas and farmers market  civic buildingstown hall  amphitheater andor public gathering spaces  equestrian amenities d historic town goals and objectives the historic town design guidelines are necessary to create a vibrant smallscale town center and are oriented towards five primary objectives  reflect the rural and agrarian context of the community   create places for gathering   enhance the existing identity in a cohesive way   establish a comfortable pedestrian environment  and  plan for transit integration by including transitoriented features 1 historic town character areas within the narcoossee historic town four character areas exist that reflect differing types of use walkability road types and usage and transitions these four zones are described as follows zone 1 small block commercial is characterized by smaller pedestrianoriented blocks narrower streets and central town square zone 2 the narcoossee road transitoriented design todcommercial is the area that calls passerbys attention to the small block commercial area while the rest of the narcoossee corridor is heavily landscaped with little or no views to the interior neighborhoods within this area the buildings will front the highway creating a more active public space along narcoossee road zone 3 town residential make up the majority of the area surrounding the small block commercial and comprises the residential component of the historic town while the block layout relies heavily on existing parcels and rightsofway the blocks range in size with a maximum of 600 feet by 250 feet a new street network area increases connectivity and enhances walkability zone 4 the culturalcommercialevent zone serves as the gathering area and the cultural center for narcoossee 2 historic town guidelines a zone 1 small block commercial 1 small block commercial architecture building size massing and use all buildings shall be built to a uniform frontage line to define the small block commercial and distinguish it from other centers and surrounding neighborhoods building use  the small block commercial zone shall have a variety of uses including housing smallscale neighborhoodoriented retail commercial and

historicallysensitive method to provide building signage for the small block commercial area these signs are more pedestrian in scale typically mounted on pilasters or walls at a height closer to the sidewalk and oriented perpendicular to the movement of pedestrians along the sidewalk a more appropriate and sensitive solution than larger flushmounted signs oriented to the automobile i use projecting bracketmounted signage where possible signs should be affixed to or hung from brackets such that the bottom of the sign is at least eight feet above the sidewalk ii signs should not be mounted higher than 12 feet above the sidewalk or project above the roof or parapet iii sign sizes styles and mounting heights should be consistent and complementary in order to unify the streetscape

sensitive method to provide building signage for the historic town sign placement sizes and mounting heights are critical in ensuring the compatibility of this type of signage with the downtown streetscape small flushmounted signs should be pedestrian in scale oriented to pedestrians along the sidewalk instead of to the automobile on the street wallmounted directory signage can be used to identify tenants on upper floors or in larger multitenant buildings i use flush wall signage where bracketmounted signage is not possible signs should be mounted at least eight feet above the sidewalk but no higher than 12 feet ii sign sizes styles and mounting heights should be consistent and complementary in order to unify the streetscape iii signs can be externally illuminated with small

 intent and purpose it is the intent of this article to ensure that public facilities and services needed to support development shall be available concurrent with the impacts of such development this article sets forth criteria for assessment of development impact and guidelines to ensure that the adopted level of service standards found in the citys comprehensive plan required for roads potable water sanitary sewer solid waste drainage and parks and recreation the city shall determine prior to the issuance of development orders whether or not there is sufficient capacity of public facilities to meet the standards for levels of service for existing development and the proposed development concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development in no case shall the city issue a development order to a proposed development until there is sufficient capacity of public facilities to meet the adopted level of service standards for existing development and the proposed development such

required to be assessed for concurrency prior to the issuance of a final development order the developerapplicant must obtain a certificate of capacity for purposes of this section final development orders are considered to be  final subdivision plat approval for singlefamily or duplex subdivisions and residential planned unit developments including residentially zoned areas of the city grid  and  site plan approval or building permit for commercial industrial or multifamily projects there are four possible scenarios related to vested rights and concurrency ie capacity availability as described by the following table vested for development rights yes development order prior to 6301991 no development order after 6301991 capacity available yes 1 issue development order and reserve capacity 2 issue development order and reserve capacity no 3 issue development order and lien on future capacity 4 do not issue development order and no reservation of capacity notes relating to above table 1 property is vested for development and capacity is available capacity will be reserved because it is available 2 property is not vested for development but capacity is available capacity will be reserved because it is available 3 property is vested for development but capacity is not available or is not sufficient available capacity is reserved with a lien on future capacity until capacity catches up with demand any and all previously issued development orders have priority over any new development orders for future capacity 4 property is not vested for development and capacity is not available capacity is not reserved  development orders issued prior to  and vested for development rights final development orders issued prior to  are determined to be vested for concurrency for the following time periods a final subdivision approval for singlefamily or duplex subdivisions and residential planned unit developments pud including residentially zoned areas of the city grid are entirely vested and individual building lots in these subdivisions and the city grid do not need to undergo a concurrency test at the time of application for a building permit unless 1 there is a change in the zoning classification or land use for the land  2 there is a major alteration to the subdivision resulting in an increase in the number of buildable lots  3 improvements which have been bonded to serve the approved subdivision or pud have not been installed and the performance bond for said improvements expires  or 4 in cases where no performance bond has been posted and improvements

 and c a certificate of occupancy is issued andor site improvements have been accepted by the city engineer once a certificate of occupancy is issued for commercial industrial or multifamily development those completed structures shall be entirely vested  exemptions from concurrency test certain development causes no added impacts on facilities and therefore can be considered exempt from concurrency and the requirement to undergo a concurrency test the following development orders or permits are considered exempt from concurrency a room additions including screen rooms to a residence  b accessory structure to a residence  c amenities swimming pools fences walls and signs  d replacement structures which have no difference in impact on public facilities  e utility stations and

for concurrency eg obtained certificate of capacity  or h any other development that generates no impact on public facilities  concurrency test requirements for development that requires one or more public facilities which are provided by entities other than the city the city shall condition the issuance of any final development order for the same parcel on the availability of such public facilities see section   5142009 144  application for concurrency tests the actual concurrency test is a determination of the capacity of public facilities needed by each applicant and a comparison of the needed amount of capacity to the capacity that is actually available if the capacity available is equal to or greater than the capacity needed the concurrency test is passed and a certificate of capacity is issued and recorded if the capacity available is less than the capacity needed the concurrency test is failed the applicant may choose to undergo a concurrency test at either the time of

capacity determination on four grounds a a technical error  b the applicant provides alternative data which has been rejected by the city  c the developer provides evidence which demonstrates that the development proposed will not produce level of service los inadequacies below the existing los standard or due to an error in the concurrency test process  or d unwarranted delay in review that allowed capacity to be given to another applicant if any capacity was encumbered prior to an appeal it will remain encumbered during the appeal process the appeal process shall begin with the city

the intent that the city not be required to bear any part of the cost of a concurrency test and that the fees and costs involved in the processing of applications shall be borne by the applicant in addition the city council may require that applicants for a certificate of capacity pay fees and charges to reserve their share of a public facility these fees and charges may include payment of impact fees connection charges etc the fees and charges shall be authorized from time to time by resolution of the city council the schedule of fees and charges shall be posted in the offices of the

requirement meets or exceeds the citys adopted level of service los for both quality and quantity and would allow the development to pass the concurrency test in addition and as required by the city engineer as a condition of development order approval in order to pass a concurrency test a development may be required to make improvements to major drainage systems which are impacted by the development these improvements are to be identified in the citys comprehensive plan andor stormwater master plan improvements include but are not limited to a construction of or improvement to major basin outfall facilities  andor b dedication of easements or rightsofway for future improvements in the area of redevelopment where an existing development generates stormwater runoff directly to the basin with no onsite stormwater facilities the following guidelines shall apply a if the identified outfall of the developmentredevelopment meets the adopted los standard then retrofit of the site to fac ch 1725 standards is not required b if the identified outfall of the developmentredevelopment does not meet the adopted los standard then 1 retrofit is not required if redevelopment does not change pre and poststormwater drainage directions  and 2 retrofit is required for only that portion of storm runoff which exceeds the existing stormwater runoff amounts the incremental increase only c for those sites where retrofit is impossible ie central business district andor highly impractical ie those built up areas of the city original grid area etc that are served by existing stormwater drainage system constructed prior to  retrofitting will not be required d in all cases redevelopment is urged to retrofit the site to meet or exceed the requirements of fac ch 1725 with no exceptions or exemptions  potable water the level of service los as adopted in the citys comprehensive plan shall be used in the determination of capacity for potable water if the developments impacts force the citys potable water system to operate above its adopted and permitted treatment capacity as identified in the support documentation for the potable water subelement of the citys comprehensive plan the concurrency test is failed provisions for issuance of a certificate of concurrency when the concurrency test finds the development will force the system to operate above its treatment capacity are found later in this regulation the land use designation of the property on which the proposed development is to be located shall be used in the calculation of potable water demand the following formulas shall be used a residential land uses total units  adopted los   potable water demand b commercial professional institutional and industrial land uses daily flow  113  adopted or comparable

shall submit a water use estimate that is signed and sealed by a professional engineer and subject to approval by the city manager or his designee 2 a comparable los standard is one which is calculated using the same assumptions as the adopted los standard the assumptions for andor the comparable los standard are those found in the support documentation for the potable water subelement of the citys comprehensive plan or other methods determined by the city c mixed use planned unit developments etc demand of residential uses as identified in subsection a above + demand of commercial professional institutional and industrial land uses as identified in subsection b above   potable water demand the potable water concurrency test shall be passed for a proposed development provided a

prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements  c the necessary facilities are under construction at the time of issuance of the final development order  or d the necessary facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires and guarantees that the necessary facilities will be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements  1192006  parks and recreation five standards identified in the citys comprehensive plan are used for determining concurrency for parks and recreation these are a location of the proposed development relative to a regional park facility  b location of the proposed development relative to a community park facility  c location of the proposed development relative to a neighborhood park facility  d population served by the neighborhood park facility  and e population served by recreation facilities only residential land uses are required to undergo a concurrency test for parks and recreation for determining whether the proposed development meets the levels of service los for the location of a development of a regional community and neighborhood parks as adopted in the citys comprehensive plan the distance from the nearest edge of the proposed development to the nearest edge of the nearest park facility shall be used if the proposed development is located further than the adopted distance the concurrency test is failed provisions for issuance of a certificate of concurrency when the concurrency test finds the development is beyond the adopted allowed distance are found later in this regulation for determining whether the proposed development meets the adopted levels of service los for the population served by a neighborhood park and for recreational facilities the existing population served by the park and all facilities plus any capacity certificates for developments which will be served by the park and all facilities shall be used in determining whether the proposed development will exceed the level of service standard persons per household by land use type as identified in the support documentation for the land use element of the citys comprehensive plan shall be used to determine population if the proposed developments population forces a recreational facility or neighborhood park need below the adopted level of service los the concurrency test is failed provisions for issuance of a certificate of concurrency when the concurrency test finds the development will adversely affect a level of service standard are found later in this regulation the parks and recreation concurrency test shall be passed for a proposed development provided a the necessary facilities and parks are in place to serve the impacts of the proposed development  b the final development order is issued subject to the condition that the necessary parks and facilities will be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements  c the necessary facilities are under construction at the time of issuance of the final development order  d the necessary parks are under procedures of acquisition at the time of issuance of the final development order  or e the necessary facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires and guarantees that the necessary facilities will be in place prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or acceptance of site improvements in addition the parks and recreation concurrency test may be passed for a proposed development provided a the necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires the commencement of the actual construction of the facilities or acquisition of the required park within one year of the issuance of the final development order  or b the necessary facilities and services are the subject if a binding executed contract

city and that growth and development in the city will require that the capacity of the citys multimodal transportation be expanded in order to maintain adequate levels of service and transportation choices and that without a funded program for multimodal transportation improvements new growth and development would have to be limited in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city of st cloud b the city council has completed a study updating the type amount and cost of projected multimodal transportation improvements needed to serve new growth and development c the purpose of this article is to ensure that new growth and development that is approved by the city pays a fair share of the costs of multimodal transportation facilities needed to serve new growth and development d this article which requires new development to pay reasonable mobility fees requires new development to pay its pro rata share of the reasonably anticipated expansion costs of new multimodal transportation facilities created by new growth and development which is the responsibility of the city in order to carry out the city of st cloud plan as amended and ensuing capital improvements program is in the best interest of the public health safety and welfare e florida statutes encourages local governments that have repealed transportation concurrency to 1 develop tools and techniques including a adoption of longterm strategies to facilitate development patterns that support multimodal solutions including urban design and appropriate land use mixes including intensity and density  b adoption of an areawide level of service not dependent on any single road segment function  and c establishing multimodal level of service standards that rely primarily on nonvehicular modes of transportation where existing or planned community design will provide adequate level of mobility f adopt an alternative mobility funding system that uses one or more of the foregoing tools and techniques g the technical data findings and conclusions herein are based on the report entitled city of st cloud mobility fee study prepared by tindaleoliver &
