projections indicate that the population of the town of fallsburg will increase substantially during the next 20 years  2 the increase in population and the incidential demand for wastewater services will directly and adversely impact the existing wastewater treatment and disposal facilities as provided by the fallsburg consolidated sewer district  3 in order to accommodate this impact the wastewater treatment and disposal facilities of the fallsburg consolidated sewer district will have to be expanded  4 the existing wastewater treatment and disposal facilities of the fallsburg consolidated sewer district are not sufficient to accommodate anticipated new development which is expected to occur in the town of fallsburg  5 the town of fallsburg comprehensive plan provides that land development be permitted only where adequate public facilities exist or can be provided to accommodate it  6 existing revenue sources are not sufficient to fund capital improvements necessary to accommodate new development  7 new development should contribute for its fair share of the costs of providing new facilities necessary to accommodate such new development  8 a thorough engineering study has been made to establish a method for developing capital recovery and capital impact fees for expanding wastewater treatment and disposal facilities  9 the capital recovery fee formula is to provide that new developers shall pay their equal share of capital costs incurred   23059 general provisions  23060   23061 authority and supersession of town law pursuant to  101iia9a 11 and 12 of

construction 10 the capital impact fee formula is not established at a rate to correct existing deficiencies  11 the capital impact fee formula as determined in this establishes a fair and conservative method of assessing new development for its fair share of costs  12 the capital recovery and impact fees will not fully pay for the costs of wastewater treatment and disposal facilities necessary for new development and the town recognizes that the shortfall will have to come from other revenue sources  and 13 increasing the capacity of wastewater treatment and disposal facilities in order to provide essential services is a recognized responsibility of government and is in the best interest of public health safety and welfare b purpose the purpose of this is to assure that new development does not overtax existing levels of service and that new development bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital expenditure necessary to provide wastewater treatment and disposal

or other entity having jurisdiction all water sewer and gas lines power telephone cable and other communication services shall be installed underground in compliance with state and local regulations e arrangement of lots and dwelling units the following guidelines shall apply 1 retain and reuse existing old farm roads and lanes rather than constructing new roads or driveways this minimizes clearing and disruption of the landscape and takes advantage of the attractive way that old lanes are often lined with trees and stone walls this is not appropriate where reuse of a road would require widening in a manner that destroys trees or stone walls 2 preserve stone walls and hedgerows these traditional landscape features define outdoor areas in a natural way and create corridors useful for wildlife using these features as property lines is often appropriate as long as setback requirements do not result in constructing buildings in the middle of fields 3 avoid placing buildings in the middle of open fields place buildings either at the edge of fields or in the ecologically least significant parts of wooded areas where they will be less intrusive to views from adjacent roads trails or high viewpoints  310143 fallsburg code  310143  4 use existing vegetation and topography to buffer and screen new buildings if possible unless they are designed and located close to the road in the manner historically found in the town site buildings in groups or tuck them behind tree lines or knolls rather than spreading them out across the landscape in a sprawl pattern 5 minimize clearing of vegetation at the edge of the road clearing only as much as is necessary to create a driveway entrance with adequate sight distance create curves in driveways with due regard to safety issues to increase the screening of buildings 6 situate buildings so that they do not protrude above ridgelines as seen from public places and roads use vegetation as a backdrop to reduce the prominence of the structure wherever creating vistas is intended open up views by selective cutting such as removal of understory vegetation and pruning lower branches of large trees rather than by clearing large areas or removing large trees 7 minimize crossing of steep slopes with roads and driveways 8 buildings are not permitted on environmentally constrained land as set forth in  31054 9 the required open space
