constitutional law   crime statistics of the city of south salt lake for the past seven 7 years  and the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the city council finds as follows a 922008 asexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism in this city to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises bsexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows coffering and providing such unregulated space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions dnumerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis salmonella campylobacter and shigella infections chlamydia mycoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections trichomoniasis and chancroid esanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities fthe findings noted in subsections b1a of this section raise substantial governmental concerns ga reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein hthe disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and will prevent the further secondary effects of dissemination of illegal obscenity child pornography and to minors materials harmful to them ithe general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment

sewer utility fee 736 billing 731 findings the city council makes the following findings regarding stormwater runoff and the city storm sewer system athe citys existing storm sewer system consists of a network of manmade and natural facilities structures and conduits including groundwater and aquifers that collect and route stormwater runoff bthe citys existing storm sewer system does not adequately handle the stormwater runoff generated in the city cthe citys anticipated growth will place increased demands on the already inadequate storm sewer system duncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff causes erosion property damage and unsafe conditions euncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff may hinder the citys ability to provide emergency services to its residents funcontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff impedes the regular flow of traffic in the city guncontrolled or inadequately controlled stormwater runoff may pose health hazards to the citizens of the community hall developed properties in the city contribute to the need for the storm sewer system by converting natural ground cover into impervious surfaces iall developed properties in the city make use of or benefit from the citys operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system jabsent effective maintenance operation regulation and control existing stormwater drainage conditions in the city constitute a potential hazard to the health safety and general welfare of the city its residents and its businesses ka storm sewer utility is the most equitable and efficient method of managing stormwater in the city and ensuring that each property in the city pays its fair share of the amount that the property contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the storm sewer system a 1061998 732 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to protect the health safety and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants by improving the citys storm sewer system managing and controlling stormwater runoff protecting property preventing polluted waters from entering the city water supply and other receiving waters and establishing a viable and fair method of financing the construction operation and maintenance of the storm sewer system a 1061998 733 definitions the following words and phrases shall be defined as follows developed parcel any

monthly storm sewer utility fee a 1061998  amd 2004  bequivalent residential unit eru the storm sewer utility fee shall be based on the number of erus contained on the parcel the city council finds that the eru is the most accurate measurement for determining the amount that each parcel contributes to benefits from and otherwise uses the storm sewer utility based upon a random survey of approximately one hundred 100 building permits for singlefamily residential homes in the city the city council finds and establishes that one eru equals two thousand nine hundred 2900 square feet of impervious surface area ccalculation the city council finds that each singlefamily residential parcel contributes approximately the same amount of stormwater runoff  therefore each developed singlefamily residential parcel shall pay a base rate of one eru all nonsinglefamily residential parcels shall pay a multiple of this base rate expressed in erus according to the measured impervious area on the parcel the city council may adopt separate rates for planned residential developments prds condominiums and other uses that are not easily handled under the standard rate schedule dcharge

building size height and density the most intense land uses are planned along the frontage of 4800 west where there exists the greatest separation from residential uses and where there is the most significant commercial potential the least intense land uses are intended to be located to the east adjacent to the elementary school and the neighboring residential area the districts in the sc1 zone are shown on the map below these consist of retail shown in red mixeduse shown in blue and office shown in yellow an overlay zone of the retail and mixeduse as shown exists in areas within three

applicants shall provide a legal agreement describing how the site shall be maintained and enforced by the city a 532016 106a5 building requirements the following shall apply to all buildings within the sc1 zone aarchitecture architecture building materials color schemes and building location all play critical roles in setting a tone for any development these same elements are of the utmost importance in creating a sense of place as a mixed use commercial area attention to scale is of particular importance and will be considered throughout the design process the following illustration demonstrates the intent of this section buildings shall be consistent with this intent image buildings in the sc1 zone shall use the american colonial style the american colonial motif is a symmetrical design ab a ab cb a etc style high pitched tile or slate roofs either side gabled or hipped overhang the front facade and are often capped with a cupola a central door often a french door is sided by large windows on the sides buildings may use the classic temple front or contain pillars pilasters and the palladian window exterior construction is normally of brick in traditional colors like red and brown and makes use of substantial exterior moldings wrought iron or copper accents are also used it is expected that this theme will create intimacy and interest by limiting the use of those architectural elements that only cater to the widespread domination of the automobile that is to say architectural designs should be kept in such a scale so as to maintain a human rather than automobile orientation the inclusion of street level windows wide walks and appropriate signs are a few of the elements that must be considered in maintaining consistency with this theme the appropriate selection of materials and colors are also essential in maintaining consistency with this theme and in meeting the goals of this requirement it is required that the established
