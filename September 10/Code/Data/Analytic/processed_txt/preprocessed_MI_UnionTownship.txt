of the charter township of union county of isabella state of michigan ordains article 1   short title and general provisions  this be known and may be cited as the union township stormwater management  and shall be referred to as statement of findings as a result of the preparation and conclusions of the stormwater management plan adopted by the township planning commission on  the charter township of union finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed 1 increases flood flows and velocities 2 contributes to erosion and sedimentation 3 overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers 4 greatly increases the cost of public facilities 5 hinders control efforts in downstream communities 6 reduces groundwater recharge and 7 threatens public health and safety b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development activities causing accelerated erosion is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people resources and environment of the township c the township board of the charter township of union further finds that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the community more specifically 1 stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving water bodies degrading water quality 2 the increase in nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters adversely affecting flora and fauna 3 improperly channeling water increases the velocity of runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation 4 siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna 5 impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff inhibiting percolation into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge 6 improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods that occur endangering property and human life 7 improperly managed stormwater runoff can interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas thereby disrupting biological productivity 8 many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff management practices   purpose a the purpose of this to reduce or eliminate the hazards to public health and safety caused by excessive stormwater runoff  to reduce the economic losses to individuals and the community at large  to enhance broader social and economic objectives  and to protect conserve and promote the orderly development of land and water resources the provisions of this supplement

drainage of the sites on which those structures are located including parking and other paved areas 7 soil erosion and sedimentation 8 the design construction and maintenance of stormwater drainage facilities and systems 9 the alteration filling and development of wetland areas b the further purpose of this be 1 to protect the public health safety and welfare by requiring stormwater management whenever new expanded or modified developments are proposed 2 to promote the most efficient and beneficial uses of land and water resources 3 to assure that stormwater runoff from development is controlled so that water quality is protected siltation is minimized and flooding problems are avoided 4 to provide for costeffective and functionally effective stormwater management and to reduce the need for future remedial projects 5 to use the natural drainage system for conveying and receiving stormwater runoff and to minimize the need to construct storm drain pipes 6 to encourage multiplepurpose stormwater management that enhances the environmental character of the charter township of union 7 to allow wetlands to be used for stormwater detention in selected locations while ensuring that the natural functions and the quality of wetlands throughout the township are protected to the maximum feasible extent 8 to recognize the private responsibility of incorporating stormwater management systems into the early stages of site planning and design 9 to allow for offsite stormwater management under specified conditions 10 to ensure that all stormwater conveyance and detention facilities will be properly maintained 11 to provide penalties for violation of the provisions of this authority this adopted in accordance with the charter township of 1947 and the

is prohibited and the waste water treatment plant superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during
