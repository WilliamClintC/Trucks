performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under s nr  wis adm findings of fact the city council finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding c purpose and intent 1 purpose the general purpose of this ordinance is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific

secondary effects of adult establishments on the community in reports made available to the city of marinette and on the holdings and findings in cases such as city of renton v playtime theatres inc

 cleburne texas dallas texas houston texas  seattle washington  newport news virginia  st croix county wisconsin  and the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses minnesota  the common council of the city of marinette finds that adult establishments may and do generate secondary effects which the common council believes are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare these secondary effects include but are not limited to 1 greater frequency as shown by crime statistics of all types of crimes especially prostitution other sexrelated crimes and controlled substance crimes in neighborhoods where adult establishments are located particularly when located in proximity to each other as well as to businesses serving alcohol which thus requires increased supervision from public safety agencies of local governments  2 increased urban blight and decay as other business and residents move out of the vicinity as they perceive adult establishments as an indication that the area is deteriorating  3 decreased property values on both residential and commercial properties which harm the economic welfare of communities and negatively affect the overall quality of life  4 increased public health risks spread of sexually transmitted diseases  and 5 increased potential for infiltration by organized crime for the purpose of unlawful conduct  whereas the common council finds based on these studies and judicial decisions such as bens bar inc v village of somerset 316 f3d 702 7th cir 2003 that the consumption of alcoholic beverages on the premises of an adult establishment exacerbates the deleterious secondary effects of such businesses on the community  whereas the common council desires to minimize and control these adverse secondary effects and thereby protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizenry preserve the quality of life protect citizens from increased crime preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight  whereas the common council finds that some of the activities described herein are protected as expression under the first amendment of the united states constitution recognizes that such rights are among our most precious and highly protected rights and wishes to act consistently with full protection of those rights  city of marinette 14 ordinances whereas it is not the purpose of this ordinance or the common council to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but instead to enact a contentneutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adult establishments  whereas the common council recognizes that it lacks authority to regulate obscenity pursuant to wis stat  3 and does not intend by adopting this ordinance to regulate obscenity but instead only intends and declares its intent to enact an ordinance addressing the secondary effects of adult establishments  whereas it is also not the intent of the common council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material since the common council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in the city of marinette  whereas the common council has authority under its general police powers as provided under wis stat  62115 to act for the good order of the city and for the health safety and general welfare of the public and may carry out its powers by regulation and suppression  whereas the common council has the authority to prescribe additional regulations for the sale of alcohol beverages under wis stat  125101 that are not in conflict with of the wisconsin statutes  whereas the common council finds that locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of the city  now therefore the common council of the city of marinette do ordain as follows marinette municipal is created as follows a purpose it is the purpose and intent of this ordinance to protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city of marinette preserve the quality of life and neighborhood characteristics prevent adverse and deleterious
