official duties or would tend to impair the persons independent judgment or action in the performance of his official duties 2 in determining whether or not a conflict of interest exists factors to be considered include the nature of the matter before the city the effect or potential effect of the actions taken by the public officials and the need for action on the matter in question 3 while a conflict of interest could conceivably exist in many instances a conflict only falls within the scope of this policy when it arises to the level of a disqualifying conflict of interest a disqualifying conflict of interest is a conflict which rises to such a level that a reasonable person viewing the matter in an objective fashion would conclude that the apparent or real conflict would not allow the involved official to make an unbiased decision in the matter 4 in the case of a proposal of general application throughout the city the issue as to whether or not a conflict of interest exists is not as closely scrutinized as when a conflict of interest exists regarding an application for action regarding a defined specific parcel of property or in a case where the action affects a particular individual or a narrowly defined class of individuals rather than the public in general in the case of a specific application a disqualifying conflict of interest exists when there is a reasonable

charges for said actions related to stormwater management facilities in accordance with minnesota statutes section  prior  842 stormwater utility fee a there is hereby established a fee for city stormwater services said fee is authorized by minnesota statutes chapter 444 and is to be uniformly applied across the city and is based upon the estimated amount of impervious surfaces for certain lots as well as the expected discharge of stormwater from a particular parcel based upon its use the purpose of the fee is to pay for costs incurred by the city for implementation of statutorily required stormwater programs for required capital improvements to the overall system required inspection of the system and replacement and repair of the system the city finds that these programs repairs maintenance and improvements benefit all properties in the city but that such benefit is not equally realized by all properties nor do properties contribute to overall stormwater flow equally b in order to provide for as equitable a system as possible the city fee is hereby established based upon a variation of the rational method as outlined in the fee study prepared for the city by hakanson anderson and associates dated  the rational method adopted is a variation of a formula taking into account the average runoff coefficient of certain classes of properties the average area of parcels within each class and the intensity of use of that parcel as set forth in the report listed herein the study identifies three 3 general classes of properties based upon use by zoning designation residential uses commercial and industrial uses and agricultural uses c based upon the formula the entire city was evaluated to determine the number of parcels in each designated zoning district the composite c values runoff coefficient were adjusted by the average area of parcels within each respective district in order to determine proper allocation of costs between different kinds of lots the final allocation of costs represents the area adjusted c value for a particular parcel as a percentage of the overall sum of area adjusted c values for the entire city d operation of the formula above results in a fee per parcel to be charged to existing parcels within the city as their fair share of the costs incurred by the city the basic formula will be recalculated yearly and included in section 312 of this order to account for ongoing changes in lot size and use and changes in zoning designation the formula may be amended from time to time by amendment to this chapter e the fee is for the purpose of paying for the ongoing review monitoring repair maintenance and improvement of the existing city stormwater infrastructure the city may include in the fee any and all costs incurred relative to stormwater drainage within the city no matter how said fees are categorized or may choose to pay portions of the fee from the general levy or other funding sources nothing in this chapter is to be construed as a limitation on the citys ability to allocate or reallocate the costs herein to this fee or to other funding sources from year to year administrative costs for collection of the fee may be added to bills as an additional charge the fee shall be administered by the city utility department and shall be billed or charged to residents on a regular basis as

the city will require the applicant to redraft them for reconsideration 2 the city will determine whether any feasible and prudent alternatives are available that would avoid impacts to wetlands an alternative will be considered feasible and prudent if it is capable of being done from an engineering point of view is in accordance with accepted engineering standards and practices is consistent with reasonable requirements of the public health safety and welfare is an environmentally preferable alternative based on a review of social economic and environmental impacts and would create no truly unusual problems the city will consider the following in evaluating alternatives as applicable  sterling codifiers inc  472497 a whether the basic project purpose can be reasonably accomplished using one or more other sites in the same general area that would avoid wetland impacts an alternate site will not be excluded from consideration only because it includes or requires an area not owned by the applicant that could reasonably be obtained used expanded or managed to fulfill the basic purpose of the proposed project  b the general suitability of alternate sites considered by the applicant  c whether reasonable modification of the size scope configuration or density of the project would avoid impacts to wetlands  d efforts by the applicant to accommodate or remove constraints on alternatives imposed by zoning standards or infrastructure including request for conditional use permits variances or planned unit developments  and e the physical economic and demographic requirements of the project economic considerations alone do not make an alternative not feasible and prudent 3 if the city determines that a feasible and prudent alternative exists that would avoid impacts to wetlands it will deny the replacement plan if no feasible and prudent alternative is available that would avoid impacts to wetlands the city will evaluate the replacement plan for compliance with subsections b4 to b6 of this section 4 determination of impact minimization a the applicant shall demonstrate to the city satisfaction that the activity will minimize impacts to wetlands in reviewing the sufficiency of the applicants efforts to minimize wetland impacts the city will consider 1 the spatial requirements of the project  2 the location of existing structural or

to the project if within thirty 30 days the applicant does not withdraw the project proposal or indicate intent to submit an amended project proposal satisfying the citys objections the statement of objections shall constitute a denial 5 determination of impact rectification temporary impacts to a wetland must be rectified by repairing rehabilitating or restoring the affected wetland a activities
