period all periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with 6047 b all wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial users discharge wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times the failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge c if an industrial user subject to the reporting requirements in and of this monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the potw using the procedures prescribed in 60611 of this the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report 5 report of changed

permit under 6054 c no industrial user shall implement the planned changed conditions until and unless the superintendent has responded to the industrial users notice d for purposes of this requirement flow increases of 10% or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants shall be deemed significant 6 reports of potential problems a in the case of any discharge including but not limited to accidental discharges discharges of a nonroutine episodic nature a noncustomary batch discharge or a sludge load which may cause potential problems for the potw including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in 6021 of this it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the township of the incident this notification shall include the location of discharge type of waste concentration and volume if known and corrective actions taken by the industrial user b within 5 days following such discharge the industrial user shall unless waived by the superintendent submit a detailed written report describing the causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense loss damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the potw natural resources or any other

waste as set forth in 40 cfr the epa hazardous waste number and the type of discharge continuous batch or other if the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the potw the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months all notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged however notification of changed discharges must be submitted under 6065 above the notification requirement in this not apply to pollutants already reported under the selfmonitoring requirements of 60613 above b discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection 1 of this a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 cfr 26130d and 26133e discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 cfr 26130d and 26133e requires a one time notification subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification c in the case of any new regulations under 3001 of rcra identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste the industrial user must notify the potw the epa regional waste management waste division director and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations d in the case of any notification made under this the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place

procedures approved by the epa 11 sample collection a except as indicated in subsection b below the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques in the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible the superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged in addition grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits b samples for oil and grease temperature ph cyanide phenols toxicity sulfides and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques 12 determination of noncompliance the superintendent may use a grab

inspection and sampling will be performed by the township at a frequency determined by the superintendent but no less than once per year the frequency of facility inspections and sampling will be determined by the type of facility type and concentrations of pollutants in the discharge and the past performance of and compliance by the industrial user when compliance sampling occurs the industrial user shall within 30 days of receipt of the invoice reimburse the township for commercial laboratory fees 2 search warrants if the superintendent has been refused access to a building

which the township determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program 6199 609 610 enforcement 1 enforcement policy a all violations of the pretreatment requirements are instances of noncompliance and will receive a specific enforcement response pretreatment requirements are a matter of strict liability hence good faith or lack of negligence on the industrial users part is no defense to a violation of the pretreatment requirements the enforcement responses will range from notices of violation to formal civil litigation andor termination of service depending on the severity of the violation while similar violations will receive similar enforcement responses there is some inherent discretion within each enforcement response selection for example some violations will trigger either administrative action formal civil litigation or permit revocation the selection of the specific enforcement response option shall be at the sole discretion of the township b when making determinations on the level of enforcement the township shall take into consideration the following 1 damage to air water land or other natural resources and their uses 2 costs of restoration and abatement 3 savings to the user as a result of the violation 4 history of past violation by the user 5 deterrence of future violations 6 other relevant factors 2 enforcement response criteria a emergency authority 1 the township may suspend the wastewater treatment service andor the wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons to the environment or causes interference to the sewer system or causes the township to violate any condition of its npdes permit 2 any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service andor the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge in the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order the township shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer system or endangerment to any individuals the township shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit andor the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge a detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of he harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the township within 5 days of the date of occurrence b enforcement procedures for violations not requiring the township to invoke its emergency authority the following procedures shall apply 1 notice of violation whenever the township finds that any user has violated or is violating this wastewater contribution permit or any prohibition limitation of requirements contained herein the township shall serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violations which may include the assessment of a civil penalty and require a written response such notice shall include the name address and telephone number of the person who will receive an appeal within 30 days of the date of the notice a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the township by the user 2 compliance schedule when the township finds that a user is in violation of this wastewater contribution permit or requirements herein the township may require the user to submit or may itself issue a schedule of compliance for the necessary correction a the schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the permit requirements eg hiring an engineer completing preliminary plans completing final plans executing contract for major components commencing construction completing construction etc b no increment referred to in subsection 1 shall exceed 9 months c not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance the user shall submit a progress report to the township including as a minimum whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and if not the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress the reason for delay and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established in no event shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress reports to the township 3 show cause hearing a the township may order any user who causes or allows a discharge of sewage industrial waste or other waste into the sewer system in violation of the provisions requirements or pretreatment standards of this the rules and regulations of the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep or the environmental protection agency epa or for any violation thereof to show cause before the township why the proposed assessment of penalty andor enforcement action should not be taken a notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the township regarding the alleged violation setting forth the specific facts and circumstances upon which the proposed enforcement action is to be taken and directing the user to show cause before the township why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken the notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail return receipt requested upon the user not less than 20 days before the hearing such notice shall contain the name address and telephone number of the township manager or other person responsible for accepting appeals within 15 days from the date of service of the notice the user shall file with the manager of the township a verified answer responding to the allegations in the notice allegations in the notice which are not specifically denied shall be deemed to have been admitted failure to file an answer or to specifically deny the allegations of the notice shall constitute a sufficient basis for the entry of a default adjudication upon expiration of said 15 days  b the township shall itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence with at least three members present c at any hearing held pursuant to this testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically and a full and complete record shall be kept of the proceedings the testimony so recorded will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual costs thereof d after the township has reviewed the evidence it may issue an order to the user responsible for the violation directing that following a specified time period the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed on existing treatment facilities or that existing devices or other related appurtenances are property operated or that any other violation be abated other orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued including but not limited to injunctive relief and assessment of civil penalties 3 civil proceedings if any person discharges sewage industrial waste or other waste into the sewer system in violation of the provisions requirements or pretreatment standards of this padep or epa which presents an imminent danger or substantial harm to the potw or the public an imminent or substantial endangerment to the environment causes the potw to violate any conditions of its discharge permit or has shown a lack of ability or intention to comply with said pretreatment provisions requirements or standards any other order of the township or if other enforcement procedures would not be adequate to effect prompt correction of the conditions or violations the township may institute an action to obtain injunctive relief in the court of common pleas of cumberland county where the activity has taken place where the condition exists or where the public is affected  4 criminal proceedings any person who knowingly makes any false statements representations or certification in any application record report plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this or wastewater contribution permit or who falsifies tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this be prosecuted to the extent permitted by law under the crimes pacsa 101 et seq 5 revocation of permit a any user who violates the following conditions of this applicable state and federal regulations is subject to having its permit revoked 1 failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge 2 failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents and characteristics 3 refusal of reasonable access to the users premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring 4 violation of conditions of the permit b if a permit is revoked the township may take steps it deems advisable including severance of the sewer connection to promote compliance with this appeal user shall have such right of appeal to the court of common pleas having jurisdiction as is provided for under 7b of the act the local agency law 2 pacsa 101 et seq or judicial pacsa 762 6199 610  as amended by 271998 611 penalties  costs 1 civil penalties any user who is found to have violated the provisions requirements or pretreatment standards of this padep or the epa an order rule regulation or permit of the township whether or not the violation is willful or negligent shall be assessed a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $25000 per day for each violation regardless of jurisdictional boundaries each violation for each separate day shall constitute a separate and distinct offense the township may recover its costs for reestablishing the operation of the potw in addition to any civil penalty imposed hereunder in addition the township may recover attorneys fees all court costs and all other expenses of litigation to the extent permitted by law  2 civil penalty assessment policy a this subsection constitutes the civil penalty assessment policy required by the publicly owned treatment penalty law herein act act no 9 of 199 35 ps 7521 et seq when making determinations on the level of enforcement the township shall take into consideration the following 1 damage to air water land or other natural resources and their uses 2 costs of restoration and abatement 3 savings to the user as a result of the violation 4 history of past violation by the user 5 deterrence of future violations 6 other relevant factors b a user must usually spend money to comply with pretreatment standards and requirements the user makes initial capital expenditures for pretreatment equipment or process changes and incurs subsequent operation maintenance and repair costs annually by delaying or avoiding these costs the user realizes an economic advantage or benefit over a competitor who complied with pretreatment requirements on time thus the economic benefit of noncompliance is defined as the difference between the costs of ontime compliance and delayed compliance economic benefits realized by the user who fails to comply by a required deadline can be measured by 1 the money that the user would expect to earn by delaying the purchase of pretreatment equipment and investing the money in more profitable projects 2 the annual costs that the user avoids and the expected return on avoided costs during the period of noncompliance 3 any competitive advantage the user may gain such as increased market share over competitors already in compliance because of cost advantages attributed to delayed compliance c in this the economic benefit calculation is focused on the first two benefits the guidance manual for potws to calculate the economic benefit of noncompliance us environmental protection agency  may be applied in calculating the penalty d consideration of the gravity and length of a violation is important when determining the penalty amount removing the economic benefit of noncompliance only places the violating user in the position it would have been had it complied on time both deterrence and fundamental fairness require that the civil penalty include an additional amount to ensure that noncompliance is more costly than compliance and the townships policy will be to include such an amount 1 recovering for damages to public facilities andor natural resources a failure to comply with pretreatment requirements may cause damage to the collection system of the township damage may also be caused to the natural environment therefore an additional purpose of penalties in pretreatment enforcement shall be to recover for such damages specifically the township may determine to require that a violating user pay reparations for any damages caused to the collection system by improper disposal of pollutants such a user may also be required to pay for replacement of equipment facilities andor other damaged processes at the potw caused by pollutant interference pollutants which pass interfered with potw processes may cause damage to natural systems in receiving waters in addition to assessing penalties to recover for such damages the township may consider requiring mitigation and remediation programs b the township will consider assessing higher penalties for violations resulting in actual or potential harm to the environment such potential environmental harm occurs whenever an industrial user discharges a pollutant into the sewer system that 1 passes potw inadequately treated and causes a violation of the potws national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit including water quality standards  or 2 has a potentially toxic effect on the receiving waters for example a fish kill 2 costs of restoration and abatement some violations may have negative impacts on the potw itself for example such violations may result in significant increases in treatment costs interfere or harm potw personnel equipment processes or operations or cause sludge contamination resulting in increased disposal costs when a users noncompliance harms the potw the township will assess a larger penalty 3 savings to the user as a result of violation a user who fails to comply with pretreatment requirements in a timely manner may accrue a significant economic benefit a penalty assessed against the violator will be fixed at a level to at least take away this economic benefit and make it unprofitable for the user to ignore or violate pretreatment requirements these requirements include installation of pretreatment equipment one time expenditure eg land and operation and maintenance o&m or other annual costs the economic benefit calculation described in this be applied to any or all types of pollution control costs 4 history of past violations a the township will consider each violation in assessing the significance of industrial user noncompliance violations of average effluent limitations will be considered a violation for each day of the averaging period therefore a monthly average violation will be counted as 30 days of violation a weekly average violation as seven days of violation and a 4 day average should be counted as four violations violations of different parameters at the same outfall are counted separately and violations at different outclass or indirect discharge locations are counted separately the amount of the penalty will be increased as the number of violations increases however as provided in the act a single operational upset shall only be considered as one violation even though it may result in simultaneous violations of more than one pretreatment standard b the township shall consider increasing penalty amounts for continuing long term violations generally a longterm violation is one that continues for 3 or more consecutive months in addition penalties will be higher for violations that have continued for 3 years than for violations that have only occurred for 6 months c significant noneffluent violations will be considered in assessing penalties violations included in this category include failure to report late reporting schedule violations failure to implement an approved pretreatment program laboratory analysis deficiencies unauthorized discharges operation and maintenance deficiencies and sludge handling violations d the township will consider increasing the penalty amount when the violating user appears to be acting in bad faith that is by not cooperating with the township in effecting a timely correction of the violation when the user experiences unjustified delays in preventing correcting or mitigating violations or when the user has already violated prior administrative orders compliance agreements or consent decrees or when the user fails to provide timely and full information this recalcitrance factor also may be increased during negotiation if the user continues to resist effort to settle e when a user demonstrates that it is unable to pay a settlement penalty the township will independently evaluate the users ability to pay when it is determined that the user cannot afford to pay the penalty or that payment of all or part of the penalty will preclude the violator from achieving compliance the township shall consider other options for example the township may consider an installment payment plan with the user paying interest only as a last recourse the township may consider reducing the penalty amount if the users behavior has been exceptionally culpable recalcitrant or threatening to human health and the environment inability to pay will be disregarded 5 deterrence of future violations a after a user installs the appropriate pollution control equipment to comply with applicable pretreatment regulations maintaining compliance requires continuing o&m and other annual expenditures for industrial users who fail to comply with pretreatment requirements the township will set its penalties at a level to remove at a minimum the economic benefit from avoided annual costs during its period of violations the township thereby determines that assessing a penalty which at a minimum eliminates the economic benefit of noncompliance or makes noncompliance more expensive than compliance will encourage users to remain in compliance b the intent of these penalties is to deter noncompliance so that pollutant discharges by a user do not have significant negative impacts on the potw plant collection systems or receiving waters the townships policy will be not to assess a penalty that is too small that is less than the economic benefit from noncomplying so that the violating user and other users may determine that noncompliance is less expensive than compliance c epa can take an enforcement action against a user violating the clean water act including federal pretreatment standards and regulations citizens or citizen groups can also bring civil suits against an individual user for violating environmental regulations if the violating user has been sued by epa a state regulatory agency or citizens and penalties were imposed upon it from these actions the township may consider reducing the penalty by an amount equal to that which the user already paid for the same violation 6 other relevant factors a in order to treat all users fairly and equitably the township will use its best efforts to assess penalties using a consistent methodology thus it will avoid allowing one user to realize an economic benefit from noncompliance which would potentially enable it to gain an economic advantage over complying users by assessing a penalty based on economic benefit the township will strive to eliminate or remove any financial advantage the violator gains b by exercising a consistent penalty methodology the township will ensure that all violators are treated equitably while the amount used to develop the penalty will be consistent 3 epa policy followed the township will take into account the policies of epa in setting penalties epa defines significant noncompliance in its revisions to the general pretreatment regulations 40 cfr 4038f 2 vii as violations which meet one or more of the following criteria a violations of wastewater discharge limit 1 chronic violations are those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements of monitored parameters taken during a 6 month period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter 2 technical review criteria trc violations are those in which 33% or more of all the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a 6 month period equal or exceed the product of the daily average maximum limit or the average limit times the applicable trc trc   14 for bod tss fats oil and grease and 12 for all other pollutants except ph 3 any other violation of pretreatment effluent limit daily maximum or longer term average that the potw determines has caused alone or in combination with other discharges interference eg slug loads or pass including endangering the health of potw personnel or the general public 4 any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the potws exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge b violations of compliance schedule milestones contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement in order for starting construction completing construction and attaining final compliance by 90 days or more after the scheduled date c failure to provide reports for compliance schedules selfmonitoring data or categorical standards baseline monitoring reports bmrs 90 day compliance reports and periodic reports within 30 days of the due date d failure to accurately report noncompliance e any other violation or group of violations that the township determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program f violation of the pretreatment requirements which constitute significant noncompliance are considered to be the most serious violation and requires a strong and immediate response assessment of civil penalties is mandatory for significant noncompliance g in addition to assessing appropriate penalties commensurate with the factors listed above the township shall consider assessing larger penalties in cases of repeat violations including all violations of permit effluent limitations monitoring and reporting requirements and other standard and special discharge conditions this consideration provides flexibility in assessing penalties for multiple violations 4 criminal penalties any person who knowingly willfully or intentionally makes any false statement representation or certification in any application record report plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this wastewater contribution permit or who falsifies tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this be prosecuted to the extent permitted by law under the crimes pacsa 101 et seq 5 remedies cumulative and concurrent the remedies provided for in this intended to be concurrent and

4 public nuisances any violation of this wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the superintendent or his designee 6199 612 613 affirmative defenses to discharge violations 1 upset a for the purposes of this upset means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation b an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection c are met c an industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the causes of the upset 2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures 3 the industrial user has submitted the following information to the potw and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within 5 days a a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance b the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue c steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance d in any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall the burden of proof e industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards f the industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails 2 generalspecific prohibitions an industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in 6021 of this it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference or no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the township was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in

statement of findings the board of commissioners of hampden township finds that a inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes e nonstormwater discharges to storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of water of the commonwealth purpose the purpose of this to promote health safety and welfare within hampden township and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in of this designed to a meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa to protect maintain reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this commonwealth b preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible c manage stormwater runoff close to the source d provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management e maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources f prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds g provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater management swm best management practices bmps that are implemented within the municipality h provide standards to meet npdes permit requirements i meet general water quality and soil disturbance goals by implementing measures to 1 minimize disturbance to floodplains wetlands natural slopes over 15% and existing native vegetation 2 preserve and maintain trees and woodlands by for example maintaining or extending riparian buffers protecting existing forested buffers and by providing trees and woodlands adjacent to impervious areas whenever feasible 3 establish and maintain nonerosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways 4 minimize soil

appreciable amounts of storm water shall be designated as such by posting onsite notices clearly visible at the sinkhole prohibiting any disposal of refuse rubbish hazardous wastes organic matter or soil into the sinkhole rock fill may be permitted in the sinkhole for the purpose of preventing dumping of said materials the discharge of stormwater runoff to the subsurface using sinkholes shall be considered as potential pollution and prohibited unless the disposal method is designed so that contaminants in the runoff will be absorbedadsorbed in the soil mantle and be acted upon by the bacteria naturally present in the mantle before reaching the groundwater systems intended to meet this requirement shall be designed by a hydrogeologist 3 if increased or concentrated runoff is to be discharged into a sinkhole including filtered discharge a geologic assessment of the effects of such runoff on increased land subsidies and groundwater quality shall be prepared and the results submitted with the drainage plan such discharge shall be prohibited if the township engineer determines that the discharge poses a hazard to life property or groundwater resources i investigations 1

runtrindle spring run watersheds for the 2 10 and 25 year design storms are provided in the release rate table on plate 4 of this development peak flows at the mouth of each of the subareas shown on plate 4 must not exceed the arithmetic product of the applicable subarea release rate times the predevelopment peak flow from the particular site under consideration b the peak discharge for each subarea in either watershed shall be calculated based upon the weighted cn which has been adjusted in accordance with the following equations 1 trindle spring run adjusted cn   13 x weighted cn30 for the 2 and 25 year events adjusted cn   12 x weighted cn20 for the 10 year events 2 hogestown run adjusted cn   11 x weighted cn10 for the 2 and 25 year events adjusted cn   12 x weighted cn20 for the 10 year events c stormwater management facilities that reduce postdevelopment peak flows may not be required or be recommended for some subareas as specified on plate 4 of this the capacity of existing drainage facilities in these subareas may be inadequate for conveying postdevelopment peak flows where the existing drainage facilities are inadequate for conveying postdevelopment peak flows the developer shall either release postdevelopment peak flows at 100 percent of the existing peak flow or increase the conveyance capacity of the inadequate drainage elements as specified in this when postdevelopment peak flows are released at 100% of the predevelopment peak significant changes in the timing of postdevelopment runoff shall not be permitted the release of postdevelopment peak flows at 100% of the predevelopment peak flow may increase the duration of the peak discharge from a site and may in turn increase peak discharges in an area that are located downstream of the site increases in peak discharges at downstream locations resulting from releasing postdevelopment peaks at 100% of predevelopment peak flows shall not be permitted and an acceptable alternative stormwater management facility or technique or capacity improvements must be implemented as part of the development e within those watershed areas designated as provisional no detention the developer may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff directly into existing conveyance systems detention facilities need not be constructed provided there is no adverse affect on the total watershed peak flow in certain instances however the local runoff conveyance facilities which transport runoff from the site to the main channel may not have adequate capacity to safely transport increased peak flows associated with not providing detention for a proposed development in those instances the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream drainage elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with 1033i in determining if adequate capacity exists in the existing local watershed drainage network the developer must assume that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this any capacity improvement must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in 1033c 3 design criteria for stormwater management facilities a incorporate stormwater management techniques into the design to reduce the runoff volume and rate of discharge these techniques may include minimizing impervious surfaces planting flat grassed waterways and using any other means to increase the time of concentration and filtration of the runoff then compute and compare pre and post development runoff hydrographs at each pointof interest for the 2 10 and 25 year events when analysis indicates that the postdevelopment hydrographs and volumes are less than or equal to the predevelopment hydrographs in peak and volume additional stormwater controls are not required for the portion of the site draining to the point ofinterest stormwater detention facilities will be required in addition to the stormwater management reduction techniques when analysis illustrates that postdevelopment peak runoff rates and volumes are greater than the predevelopment runoff rates and volumes design the detention facilities and related structures to release the 2 10 and 25 year events in accordance with the performance standards found on plate 4 and in other sections of this rules and regulations 1 pa dep rules and regulations apply to the construction modification operation or maintenance of both

ararat boulevard room 147 harrisburg pennsylvania 17110  2 any stormwater management facility required or regulated by this be designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow up to the 100 year postdevelopment conditions the height of embankment must be set as to provide a minimum of 1 foot of freeboard above the maximum pool elevation computed when the facility functions for the 100 year postdevelopment inflow however criteria for design and construction of stormwater management facilities are not the same criteria that are used in permitting of dams under the dam safety program depending upon the physical characteristics of a dam a dam permit may be required and the design will have to meet the provisions of of the dam safety and encroachments act depending on the physical characteristics of a dam the design could require that anywhere from a 50 year to a probable maximum flood storm event be considered c any hydraulic capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this use the following criteria to determine if adequate hydraulic capacity exists 1 open channels must be able to convey postdevelopment runoff from a 2 year design storm within their banks at velocities that would not erode the channel bed or banks acceptable velocities shall be based on criteria included in the pa dep soil erosion and sedimentation control manual as amended or replaced from time to

discharge at the mouth of the subarea does not exceed the arithmetic product of the applicable release rate specified on plat 4 of this the predevelopment peak flow from the particular site under consideration f for development sites that would be located in two or more subareas the applicable release rates for the portions of the site located in different subareas shall be based on natural subarea drainage boundaries the natural drainage boundaries between subareas shall not be modified nor shall drainage from a development site be diverted or otherwise conveyed from one subarea to another subarea except where runoff naturally crosses subareas drainage boundaries g no harm option 1 for any proposed development site not located in a provisional no detention subarea the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control including no detention if the developer can prove that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan proof of no harm would have to be shown from the development site remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the hogestown runtrindle spring run with the conodoguinet creek proof of no harm must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in 1033c if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification 2 attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions a the peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period storms 2 10 and 25 year shall be the values from the calibrated hogestown runtrindle spring run watershed these flow values would be supplied to the developer by the township engineer upon request b any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity ie if the site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage the developer may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity c developer proposed construction generating increased peak flow rates at documented storm drainage problem areas would by definition be precluded from successful attempt to prove no harm except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with this d the developer must assume that the entire subarea in which the site is located is developed in accordance with the zoning in effect at the project is to be approved for development 3 any no harm justification shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per 104 h regional or subregional stormwater
