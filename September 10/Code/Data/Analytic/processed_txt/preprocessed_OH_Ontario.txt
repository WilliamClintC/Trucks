administrative part three  traffic part five  general offenses part seven  business regulation part nine  streets utilities and public services part eleven  planning and zoning part thirteen  building part fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances  the comparative is included to

supervision from the public safety agencies of the city of ontario in order to protect and preserve the health safety morals and welfare of the patrons and employees of the businesses as well as the citizens of the city of ontario 2council finds that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 3the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of council that demands reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by council in the specified manner and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by local governments in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens 4minimal regulations enacted by council are a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 5there is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment establishments because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them cause increased crime particularly in the overnight hours and downgrade property values 6council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner and by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects council seeks to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight 7council has determined that current local zoning and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health safety

chapter to regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city of ontario and establish

restrict or deny or authorize the restriction or denial of access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny or authorize the denial of access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of council in enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the

council makes the following statement of intent and findings 1adult entertainment establishments require special supervision from the public safety agencies of the city of ontario in order to protect and preserve the health safety morals and welfare of the patrons and employees of the businesses as well as the citizens of the city of ontario 2council finds that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 3the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of council that demands reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by council in the specified manner and expanded authority for reasonable regulation of adult entertainment establishments by local governments in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens 4minimal regulations enacted by council are a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 5there is convincing documented evidence that adult entertainment establishments because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them cause increased crime particularly in the overnight hours and downgrade property values 6council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects by regulating adult entertainment establishments in the specified manner and by minimizing and controlling these adverse effects council seeks to protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight 7council has determined that current local zoning and other locational criteria do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the people of the city of ontario and that expanded regulation of adult entertainment establishments is necessary 8it is not the intent of council in enacting this act to suppress or authorize the suppression of any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact contentneutral statutes that address the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments 9it is not the intent of council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and council recognizes that state and federal law prohibits the distribution of obscene materials and expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in this state bit is the intent of council in enacting this chapter to regulate in the specified manner adult entertainment establishments in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city of ontario and establish reasonable regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments within the city of ontario the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent of council in enacting this chapter to restrict or deny or authorize the restriction or denial of access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny or authorize the denial of access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult entertainment and adult materials to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of council in enacting this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution or exhibition of obscene material cbased on evidence concerning

composite sampling show a violation of the maximum dialy limit the discharger will be required to report fourteen consecutive calendar days of sampling performed for the pollutant in violation this sampling must be completed within thirty calendar days of notification of the violation if the results of the sampling show violation does occur then the discharger will be notified that a new compliance schedule is required if the sampling indicates no additional violations then no further action will be required by the discharger at that time where categorical standards allow for a fourday average limit and the report of scheduled sampling show the discharge exceeded the fourday average but within the maximum daily limit the city will perform a second sampling for the parameter of concern if the second sampling again indicates the discharge is in excess of the fourday average the discharger will be notified and will be required to report seven days of sampling for that

extension of any street or road  and 3must involve no more than five lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided  and 4must not be contrary to applicable platting subdividing or

based on oag opinion 71083 aa contiguous quantity of land held by one person or in common ownership  which has not been platted by the existing owner  this means 1a tract can be original to one person

specific subdivider may later decide to increase the number of lots in a subdivision  but to do so  and assuming there are more than five lots as a result it would be necessary to replat the original tract 3it is possible for a tract to be completely subdivided and then be further subdivided by a party who purchases or takes title to a parcel in a subdivision large enough to be divided  dthe ohio attorney general has concluded 1tract means a contiguous quantity of land undivided by lot lines 2original contemplates a tract which has not been divided under its present ownership 3original tract means a continuous quantity of land held by one person or in common which has not been platted by the existing owner 4the phrase involving no more than five lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided applies only to the necessity for replatting to accomplish changes in an already subdivided tract   examples  a   images0002527jpg public road
