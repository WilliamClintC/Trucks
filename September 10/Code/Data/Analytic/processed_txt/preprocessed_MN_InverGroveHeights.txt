for primarily combination of special assessments levied against benefited property and connection charges such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used may be appropriate in certain circumstance in the future however the city has determined that it is now necessary and desirable to amend and refine the method of recovering some or all of the future costs of constructing operating maintaining and improving the water system imposition of charges as provided in this chapter b in imposing fees and charges it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable taking into account the status of completion of the water system in portions of the city past methods of recovering water system costs and the factors set forth in the utilities act it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for the future costs of constructing operating maintaining and improving the water system primarily based on the methodology described in this chapter c the city has further determined that the water system has yet to be constructed in the northwest area and it is just and equitable to impose charges for construction maintenance and operation of the water system on a different basis in the northwest area compared to the balance of the city where portions of the water system have been financed assessments d assigning costs and making charges for the water system in both the northwest area and the balance of the city cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits based upon analysis of the factors described in this chapter e to ensure that charges for the water system are just and equitable the city has further determined to impose fees for connection to the city water utility system to pay for the construction reconstruction repair enlargement improvement or other obtainment the maintenance operation and use of the facilities and of obtaining and complying with permits required by law the fee to be charged for a connection to the water system shall be used for defraying the cost to the

and related financing costs in connection with obligations issued by the city to finance such improvements depreciation a reasonable reserve for capital replacement and the costs of obtaining and complying with permits required by law 5 the city has further determined that it is fair and equitable in light of the citys long term and ongoing costs of acquisition maintenance and repair of the water system to impose connection fees payable in part at the time property is platted or building permits are issued whichever occurs first and in part payable at the time when building permits are issued or when connection is made to the water system whichever occurs first and further that fees payable in the northwest area compared to the balance of the city may take into consideration the

code notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter such connection fees are in addition to and separate from rates for the use of water imposed under subsection 8210a of this chapter 3

against benefited property and connection charges such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used may be appropriate in certain circumstance in the future however the city has determined that it is now necessary and desirable to amend and refine the method of recovering some or all of the future costs of constructing operating maintaining and improving the sanitary sewer system imposition of charges as provided in this chapter 2 in imposing fees and charges it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable taking into account the status of completion of the sanitary sewer system in portions of the city past methods of recovering sanitary sewer system costs and the factors set forth in the utilities act it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for the future costs of constructing operating maintaining and improving the sanitary sewer system primarily based on the methodology described in this chapter 3 the city has further determined that the sanitary sewer system has yet to be constructed in the northwest area and it is just and equitable to impose charges for construction maintenance and operation of the sanitary sewer system on a different basis in the northwest area compared to the balance of the city where portions of the sanitary sewer system have been financed assessments 4 assigning costs and making charges for the sanitary sewer system in both the northwest area and the balance of the city cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits based upon analysis of the factors described in this chapter 5 to ensure that charges for the sanitary sewer system are just and equitable the city has further determined to impose fees for connection to the city sanitary sewer utility system to pay for the construction reconstruction repair enlargement improvement or other obtainment the maintenance operation and use of the facilities and of obtaining and complying with permits required by law the fee to be charged for a connection to the sanitary sewer system shall be used for defraying the cost to the city of the following a the cost to the city for making any and all necessary inspections of such connection b the cost to the city for repair of any street or roadway caused by or resulting from such connection c the cost to the city for the installation of the service line running from the main to the wye branch in accordance with subsection 84 4e of this chapter d the charge on a proportionate basis of the cost to the city of acquiring the core facilities of the city sanitary sewer system determined on a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis allocated on the basis of water consumed by reference to a reasonable classification of the  sterling codifiers inc  246526 types of premises to which sanitary sewer service is furnished including classifications based on the expected density of such premises on an sac unit basis including by reference to the density of such units by reference to the quantity pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of sewage produced including by reference to the size of sanitary sewer service facilities serving the subject property or any other equitable basis including a combination of the foregoing equitable basis but excluding an allocation by reference to the square footage of the property charged except to the extent square footage is relevant to calculation of the density of premises andor sac units to be served core facilities as that term is used herein shall be deemed to include all mains trunk lines and lift stations of or for the sanitary sewer system and costs of core facilities include debt service and related financing costs in connection with obligations issued by the city to finance such improvements depreciation a reasonable reserve for capital replacement and the costs of obtaining and complying with permits required by law 6 the city has further determined that it is fair and equitable in light of the citys long term and ongoing costs of acquisition maintenance and repair of the sanitary sewer system to impose connection fees payable in part at the time property is platted or building permits are issued whichever occurs first and in part payable at the time when building permits are issued or when connection is made to the sanitary sewer system whichever occurs first and further that fees payable in the northwest area compared to the balance of the city may take into consideration the additional costs of installing the sanitary sewer system in the northwest area b fees amounts sanitary sewer connection fees including the timing and manner of payment shall be specified in section 3422 of this code notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter such connection fees are in addition to and separate from rates for the use of the sanitary sewer system imposed under section 846 of this chapter c relationship to special assessments notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter the city may determine that it is just and equitable to finance the capital costs of sanitary sewer system improvements in the northwest area or elsewhere in the city assessments under minnesota statutes chapter 429 provided that the city reasonably determines that the capital costs so financed are not otherwise financed from connection fees collected under this chapter  846 sewer rates the rates to be charged for sewer rental shall be determined from time

known as the stormwater sewer utility system  872 findings and purpose in providing for charges the following findings and determinations are made a in the exercise of its governmental authority and in order to promote the public health safety convenience and general welfare the city has constructed operated and maintained a stormwater runoff system in portions of the city and intends to continue to improve operate and maintain that system as a stormwater utility under the utility act this chapter is adopted in the further exercise of such authority b the stormwater system as constructed to date heretofore has been financed and paid for primarily combination of special assessments levied against benefited property and the imposition of ad valorem taxes within certain watershed management tax districts established under minnesota statutes section 103b245 such financing methods were appropriate to the circumstances at the time they were used may be appropriate in certain circumstance in the future however the city has determined that it is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of constructing operating maintaining and improving the stormwater system imposition of charges as provided in this chapter  sterling codifiers inc  273526 c in imposing fees and charges it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable taking into account the status of completion of the stormwater system in portions of the city past methods of recovering stormwater system costs and the factors set forth in subdivision 3b of the utility act it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for the future costs of constructing operating maintaining and improving the stormwater system primarily based on the methodology described in this chapter d the city has further determined that the stormwater system has yet to be constructed in the northwest area and that the stormwater improvements in that area will be based on the northwest area stormwater system which includes without limitation rain gardens infiltration basins biofiltration trenches and other stormwater management techniques in light of the northwest area stormwater system compared to stormwater runoff systems existing in the balance of the city it is just and equitable to impose charges for construction maintenance and operation of the stormwater system on a different basis in the northwest area compared to the balance of the city e assigning costs and making charges for the stormwater system in both the northwest area and the balance of the city cannot be done with mathematical precision but can only be accomplished within reasonable and practical limits based upon analysis of the factors described in this chapter f to ensure that charges for the stormwater system are just and equitable the city has further determined that 1 the capital cost of future improvements to the system in the northwest area are most fairly financed fees payable at the time property is platted or building permits are issued whichever occurs first  2 the capital cost of future improvements to the system in the balance of the city outside the northwest area are most fairly financed assessments or watershed management taxes  and 3 the costs for operation and maintenance of the stormwater system are most fairly financed by operation charges payable in accordance with other city utility procedures and at rates reflecting the different levels of operation and maintenance cost of the stormwater system in the northwest area and the balance of the city  873 stormwater system established a city stormwater system is hereby established the stormwater system

the basis described in items 1  of this subsection but excluding any reference to the amount of water consumed the connection fee must be a fair and equitable share of the amount reasonably calculated to pay total projected capital costs of the northwest area stormwater system constructed as part of the stormwater system within the northwest area including the cost of debt service and related financing costs in connection with obligations issued by the city to finance such improvements depreciation a reasonable reserve for capital replacement and the costs of obtaining and complying with permits required by law in determining the connection fee the city may give consideration to all costs of establishing the system and of improvements enlargements and extensions necessary to serve adequately the northwest area the connection fee including timing and manner of payment shall be specified in subsection 3422g of this code as amended from time to time b operation charges the city may impose an operation charge on all owners and users of the stormwater system in the city based on 1 the square footage of the property to be charged adjusted for a reasonable calculation of stormwater runoff 2 a reasonable classification of the types of premises to which service is furnished 3 by reference to the quantity pollution qualities and difficulty of disposal of stormwater runoff produced or 4 any other equitable basis including any combination of the basis described in items 1  of this subsection but excluding any reference to the amount of water consumed the operation charge must be a fair and equitable share of the amount reasonably calculated to pay total operation and maintenance costs of the stormwater system notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein the operation charge will consist of a minimum charge imposed on all property and users in the city an additional charge for property within the northwest area and an additional charge for property in the balance of the city recognizing the differential in operation and maintenance costs in those two 2 portions of the city the connection fees for the northwest area and the balance of the city including timing and manner of payment shall be specified in section 3422 of this code as amended from time to time c supplying information the owner occupant or person in charge of any premises must supply the city with such information as the city may reasonably request related to the use development and area of the premises and the imposition of any connection fee or operation charge wilful failure to provide such information or to falsify it is a violation of this subsection d estimated fees if the owner occupant or person in charge of any premises fails or refuses to provide the information requested as provided in subsection c of this section the fee for such premises must be estimated and billed in accordance with such estimate based upon information then available to the city  sterling codifiers inc  274526 e payment and collection all connection fees and operation charges imposed under this section are charges against the respective owner lessees and occupants and are due

charges to become a lien against the property served by certifying to the county auditor the amount of such delinquent bill in accordance with the utility act  875 use of revenues revenues received from connection fees and operation charges are to be placed in a separate stormwater system account and used to pay the normal reasonable and current costs of constructing operating maintaining and improving the stormwater system the city finance director may establish such funds and subaccounts within the stormwater system account as deemed reasonable and necessary to manage the stormwater system in accordance with the utility act revenues from time to time received in excess of amounts needed to pay costs of operation and maintenance of the stormwater system including any operating reserve established within the stormwater system account may be used to finance improvements to and betterments of the stormwater system in accordance with the utility act  876 relationship to watershed management tax districts and special assessments notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this chapter the city may determine that it is just and equitable to finance the capital costs of stormwater system improvements in the northwest stormwater area or elsewhere in the city establishment of watershed management tax districts under minnesota statutes section 103b245 or special assessments under minnesota statutes chapter 429 provided that the city reasonably determines that the capital costs so financed are not otherwise financed from connection fees collected under this

encouraging a development pattern in harmony with land use density transportation facilities and community facilities and objectives of the comprehensive plan  1013a2 interpretation the provisions of this article shall be interpreted in accordance with the following a planned unit developments may be excluded from certain requirements of this title when specifically approved as a part of the planned unit development such exclusions shall only be granted for the purpose of creating better overall design and an improved living environment and not solely for the economic advantage of the developer all provisions of this title not specifically excluded in the preliminary andor final plan shall apply to the planned unit development b in most cases the granting of a planned unit development permit does not alter in any manner the underlying zoning district classification except that building permits shall not be issued which are not in conformity with the approved planned unit development in those cases where a specific planned unit development ordinance is adopted for a development in contrast to those cases in which adoption of an ordinance simply effects a rezoning of the development site to a planned unit development district the granting of a planned unit development permit to that development shall confer upon its planned unit development ordinance precedence over this title c whenever a dispute arises concerning the interpretation andor application of any section of this title the matter may be referred to the board of adjustments and appeals for hearing pursuant to section 1037 of this title  1013a3 relation of planned unit development site to adjacent areas the design of a planned unit development shall take into account the relationship of the site

units per acre than would otherwise be permitted by the regulations otherwise applicable to the site  however the applicant has the burden to show that such excess will not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities and on the reasonable enjoyment of neighboring property the council in determining the reasonableness of the increase in the authorized dwelling units per acre shall recognize that increased density may be compensated for by additional private amenities and by increased efficiency in public facilities and services to be achieved by 1 the location amount and

inc  411526 mixed municipal solid waste landfills have the potential to cause negative environmental impacts relating to storm water quality ground water quality air emissions aesthetics general community and neighborhood image and public nuisances as a result the city has found that many land uses are not compatible with and will not locate adjacent to or near a mixed municipal solid waste landfill this tends to restrict development opportunities on surrounding properties thus hindering the expansion of the citys commercialindustrial tax base and employment opportunities it also causes a public concern that landfill expansion may be proposed for such undeveloped areas a the city specifically finds that certain solid waste processing uses are compatible with and may benefit from a location in proximity to a mixed municipal solid waste landfill and other solid waste uses this is evident from the uses that have already been established near the pine bend mixed municipal solid waste landfill and the continued interest on the part of other such uses in the same area the concentration of mixed municipal solid waste landfills and solid waste facilities provides for 1 effective and efficient public facilities and services  2 the potential for shared private facilities and services  and 3 strong operational interrelationships concentrating solid waste uses reduces the area of the city potentially subject to the negative environmental impacts identified above from such facilities and enhances the citys ability to protect the natural environment regulation and inspection of these uses furthermore it is necessary to further restrict the area in which solid waste uses are allowed and to continue to place restrictions and conditions on these uses to protect the environment and to promote sound land use planning b the city also finds that the integrated resource management overlay district boundaries encompass an area which is unique to the city since no other area in the city exhibits these special characteristics the district boundaries will only be imposed within the defined boundaries and shall not be expanded the unique characteristics of this stated area include the following 1 a concentration of existing solid waste facilities including a mixed municipal solid waste landfill and other compatible heavy industries such as the koch refining co complex 2 an area which is generally separated and buffered from surrounding low density residential areas by large tracts of undeveloped or agricultural lands 3 an excellent transportation network including railroads a regional highway and a local collector street that provides direct access to the regional highway this roadway system is undergoing improvements such as the recent intersection signals frontage road and intersection geometric being installed at 117th street further development of the transportation system is anticipated including additional frontage roads and an interchange 4 intensive environmental analysis and monitoring including air quality and ground water monitoring that have occurred in recent years to address environmental concerns 5 a comprehensive plan land use designation of general industrial and light industrial this is further reflected in the i1 and i2 zoning of the area 6 affordable land costs due in part to the absence of sanitary sewer which makes the area suitable for those industries that require large parcels but do not need city sewer services 7 level terrain with little vegetation that makes the area conducive to large industrial facilities  1013e2 purpose the integrated resource management irm overlay zoning district is created for the following purposes a prevent the expansion of mixed municipal solid waste landfills by encouraging industrial development on adjacent properties b encourage solid waste processing facilities which can integrate their operations with mixed municipal solid waste landfills to locate in proximity to such landfills c promote orderly development of other properties in the community by creating a buffer of compatible industrial development around mixed municipal solid waste landfills d reduce the areas of the city subject to the potential adverse environmental impacts of solid waste processing facilities by encouraging them to locate in close proximity to mixed municipal solid waste landfills and each other e delineate an area for select solid waste uses that exhibit minimal environmental impacts and are generally environmentally friendly f provide an opportunity for solid waste uses that are consistent with the states waste management hierarchy of encouraging reduction reuse recycling composting and discouraging incineration and landfilling g enhance regulation and inspection of solid waste processing facilities by encouraging them to locate in proximity to one another  sterling codifiers inc  412526 h enhance the tax base by encouraging development around mixed municipal solid waste landfills consistent with sound principles of municipal planning i provide additional employment opportunities for city residents by encouraging industrial development j establish standards and restrictions for solid waste uses to protect the environment and to promote sound land use planning  1013e3 definitions a if any word or term used in section 1022 of this title

contrary contained in this article if any of the prohibited uses listed in section 1013e7 of this article were lawfully existing at the time the use became prohibited either because of adoption of this article or any amendments hereto then such use may continue in the size and manner of operation lawfully existing or lawfully permitted to exist upon the date such use became prohibited but such uses shall not expand or enlarge or add different types of waste b if the owner or operator of an existing prohibited use applies for a nonconforming use certificate the application shall include the following information in addition to the information normally required under chapter 16 of this title 1 the types of prohibited use which existed on the effective date hereof which made the use prohibited 2 the lot or lots owned or occupied by the use on the effective date hereof which made the use prohibited with evidence of ownership or occupancy 3 if the prohibited use is a landfill the airspace authorized by the metropolitan council or moea on the effective date hereof which made the use prohibited with evidence of the metropolitan council or moea authorization 4 if the prohibited use is a landfill the remaining airspace capacity last reported to the mpca 5 the waste types received by the facility on or prior to the effective date hereof which made the use prohibited with evidence of receipt c 1 a number of factors make the prohibited uses unique from a land use regulation standpoint including a the dynamic evolutionary nature of solid waste industry regulation  b the overlapping regulations of various federal state and local agencies which apply to a prohibited use  c the differing wastes disposed or processed now and in the past by prohibited uses  d the fluctuations in prohibited use disposal and processing rates  e the number type and intensity of accessory uses directly related to the prohibited uses  f the challenges posed to the city in

healthful and desirable environment for all citizens of the city the city must not only provide these necessary amenities for our citizens today but also be insightful to the needs of future citizens b the city council recognizes that the demand for park playground trail and public open space within a municipality is directly related to the density and intensity of development permitted and
