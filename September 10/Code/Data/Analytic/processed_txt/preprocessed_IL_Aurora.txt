purpose a the purpose of this article is to establish regulations for the facilities and equipment involved in all modes of communication and intended to regulate all such communication as it now exists and in the future including for example communication and wireless data transfer services as well as their accompanying facilities including but not limited to antennas dishes poles equipment and towers the goals of this article are 1 to protect residential and riverfront areas and land uses by minimizing adverse impacts of towers antennas dishes poles and communications and data transfer facilities  2 to encourage the location of all such facilities in nonresidential and nonriverfront areas and to ensure that they are located in areas that minimize adverse impacts  3 to enhance the ability to provide all such modes of communication services to the community quickly effectively and efficiently  4 to promote encourage and require as appropriate the shared usecollocation of such facilities as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse structures and to encourage the attachment of antennas dishes and equipment to existing structures  5 to promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new structures to support such communication facilities  6 to ensure such facilities are configured in a way that minimizes adverse visual impacts by careful design appropriate siting landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques  7 to avoid potential damage to property caused by such facilities by insuring such structures facilities and equipment are soundly and carefully designed constructed modified maintained and removed when no longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound  8 to ensure that all such facilities are compatible with surrounding land uses  and 9 to ensure that said communications facilities do not compromise public safety
