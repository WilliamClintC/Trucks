of this division is to establish standards within the airport influence area overlay zone the regulations in this division are intended to apply to specific areas of the city that recognize benefits and potentially adverse impacts that may occur within certain distances from an airport and to provide regulations that both minimize these impacts and protect aircraft operations b noisesensitive uses these regulations are intended to minimize exposure of residential and other noisesensitive land uses from uncontrollable aircraft noise and high numbers of aircraft overflights  to minimize risks to public safety from potential aircraft accidents  to discourage traffic congestion within these areas by regulating land use densities  and to restrict incompatible land uses within the airport influence area overlay zone c interagency coordination these regulations recognize the efforts of other agencies and show the citys willingness to cooperate with these agencies in the administration of these regulations effective on  02 interpretation and disclaimer a interpretation in the event a lot is located within more than one noise contour the entire lot shall be subject to the restrictions of the noise contour that most restricts development of the lot this provision shall not be applied to prevent or discourage subdivision of a subject property to minimize encroachment into noise contours or to prevent straddling the boundary between noise contours b disclaimer the degree of protection provided by this division is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on planning engineering and scientific methods of study and in coordination with aviation agencies this division does not imply that areas outside of the airport influence area overlay zone will be totally free from aircraft hazards and therefore shall not create a liability on the part of the city or any of its officers or employees for any damages resulting from reliance on this division effective on  03 airport influence area overlay zone boundaries a generally 1 the boundaries of the airport influence area overlay zone and its noise contours are based in part upon predictions of day to day noise levels that are perceptible at ground level these predictions are based upon acoustical modeling techniques that are accepted as accurate and reliable by the federal aviation administration faa and by hundreds of airport operators and municipalities nationwide but are difficult for property owners to test or confirm 2 the city council has determined that the noise contours and critical areas that are relied upon in part as the basis for the airport influence area overlay zone regulations are accurate and reliable for the purposes of land use planning the city council has also determined that based upon the usage patterns of the airport the contours and the restrictions associated therewith reflect sound land planning principles and are justified based upon the current airport traffic regardless of whether the noise predictions are accurate 3 the boundaries of the airport influence area overlay zone and its associated noise contours and critical areas shall be reviewed and amended when appropriate either in conjunction with adoption of updated studies by the airport or based upon other credible information and studies as determined by the city council b

different housing types may be constructed the housing palette allows an applicant to provide a variety of lot sizes and product types but does not require a minimum floor area for any particular building minimum floor area is set by the applicable building code 2 after the number of dwelling units that are allowed on a subject property is calculated pursuant to division  residential density and after required dedications and open spaces are set aside the applicant may design the buildable areas of the property to include any of the housing types that are allowable for the subject property pursuant to residential land use by zone 3 the design of the development is subject to the applicable provisions of part 3 site design and environmental quality b differentiating among singlefamily detached housing types 1 singlefamily detached sets out seven lot types for singlefamily detached housing to meet the requirements for any lot type both the lot area and the lot width minimums must be met 2 for example a if a developer proposes a 4000 square feet lot that is 45 feet  wide the lot would be classified as an urban lot b if a developer proposes a 7000 square feet lot that is 50 feet  wide the lot would be classified as a general lot c classifications that include floor area thresholds certain housing types are defined by their floor area eg micro homes cottages and cluster duplexes a micro home or cottage may be constructed as the principal dwelling unit on any singlefamily detached lot and a cluster duplex may be constructed as the principal building on any duplex lot or pair of lots as applicable unlike their larger singlefamily detached or duplex counterparts these cluster housing types may also be constructed as allowed in manufactured homes and micro homes in manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions and clustered housing types d alternative standards for condominium ownership or alternative lotting patterns 1 the standards of this division with respect to lot area lot width and setbacks relate to the development of residential buildings on conventional lots that are intended to be owned in feesimple by the owners of the buildings however the standards are not intended to preclude other ownership types such as condominiums in which the land is owned in common by the owners of the condominium units or common maintenance communities in which fee simple ownership is limited to the land under the building and in some cases a small area around it 2 alternative standards for lot area lot width and setbacks may be approved provided that the proposed development could be approved pursuant to this udc using conventional feesimple ownership arrangements that applicant must demonstrate that it would comply with the density open space and applicable setback requirements of this udc if the proposed development was platted with lots that meet the minimum requirements of this division for each of the proposed housing types effective on  02 lot averaging option a generally lot averaging allows for flexibility with regard to lot width and lot area when property is subdivided for residential uses b applicability applicants may apply lot averaging to the housing types described in singlefamily detached duplexes or townhomes as follows 1 lot width and lot depth may be reduced by up to 10 percent from the standards set out in the applicable table for lots up to 50 feet in width and 15 percent for lots 50 feet in width or more provided that the average lot width and lot depth for each housing type within the subdivision is at least that which is set out in the applicable table  and 2 each individual block in the subdivision that includes one or more lots that are modified pursuant to this a more than one housing type  or b a mix of lot sizes such that smallerthanaverage lots occupy not more than 40 percent of the block effective on  03 singlefamily detached a generally singlefamily detached homes are residences for one family that are typically located on a privatelyowned lot with private yards on each side of the unit singlefamily detached homes may also be located on property that is covered by a condominium declaration surrounded by limited common elements for use by residents of the singlefamily detached home which would serve the same purpose as a private yard see

standards the provisions in this division shall apply c expansions of existing buildings the standards of this division apply to expansions of existing buildings as follows 1 the standards shall apply to expansions of existing buildings after an application threshold is crossed as follows a the floor area of the existing building as of the effective date of this udc is the base floor area b expansions of the base floor area are exempt from this division provided that cumulatively they do not increase the base floor area by more than 25 percent 25 percent is the application threshold c when the application threshold is crossed all applications for expansions of the existing building must meet the standards of this division see figure 01 illustrative application figure 01 illustrative application 1 2 3 building a had 10000 square feet of floor area at the time this udc was adopted as such a the base floor area is 10000 square feet and b the application threshold 25 percent of the base floor area is 2500 square feet two years after the udc was adopted the owner of building a obtains a permit to add 1500 square feet of floor area a 1500 square feet is less than the application threshold so this division does not apply five years after the udc was adopted the owner of building a seeks another permit to add 1500 square feet of floor area a since 1500 square feet had already been added the new application if approved would result in 3000 square feet of cumulative expansion b the application thus crosses the application threshold 2500 square feet and is therefore subject to the standards of this division 2 it is intended that a building expansion that is subject to these standards be reasonably integrated with the existing building or site condition

encourages the sharing of parking for its potential to reduce impervious surfaces or enhance the efficiency of land use thus where a mix of uses creates synergy with respect to the utilization of parking spaces due to differences in peak parking demand periods the city may reduce the required number of spaces according to the provisions of this shared parking table shared parking allows a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces when a subject property is occupied by two or more uses that typically do not experience peak parking demands at the same time when any land or building is used for two or more uses that are listed in table 05a shared parking the minimum total number of required parking spaces may be determined by the director by the following procedures 1 multiply the minimum required parking for each individual use excluding spaces reserved for use by specified individuals or classes of individuals except car share programs by the appropriate percentage listed in table 05a shared parking for each of the designated time periods 2 calculate a sum for all uses for each of the five time periods columns the minimum parking requirement is the highest of these sums plus any reserved spaces that were excluded from the calculation in the first step figure 05a illustrative shared parking credit calculation provides an example of how to use

between the anticipated benefit if any and the anticipated burden on the community or immediate area if any is either neutral or favors the rezoning  3 the proposed zone would not cause an i zone to share a boundary with an er r1e r1 r2 r3e or r3 zone unless there is sufficient land area on the subject property to provide a buffer as set out in division  standards for bufferyards and a development agreement is approved to mitigate use incompatibilities with fencing walls landscaping noise and lighting restrictions or other appropriate techniques  and 4 adequate community facilities are available to serve development in the proposed zone in accordance with determination regarding adequacy  or the proposed zone would limit demands upon community facilities more than the existing zone  or reasonable assurances are provided that adequate community facilities will be made available to serve new development by the time the new development places demands on the facilities d additional findings the city council may approve an application for rezoning upon a determination that at least one of the following three criteria has been met this finding is in addition to the findings regarding the criteria of subsections b and c above 1 alternative #1 plan implementation the proposed zone is more appropriate than the existing zone to implement an adopted or approved
