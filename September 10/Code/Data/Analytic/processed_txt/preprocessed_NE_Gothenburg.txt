the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime the downgrading of property values the downgrading of adjacent neighborhoods making adjacent neighborhoods significantly less attractive and less safe for raising children and denigrating both residential life and commercial activity for other types of businesses and sexually

acts occurs at sexually oriented businesses which provide private or semiprivate booths or viewing rooms for the viewing of films videos or live performances dthe findings noted above raise

to adopt zoning regulations designed to protect the public health safety and general welfare the legislature in neb rs 311001 to 311022 as amended has further assigned the responsibility to adopt administer and enforce floodplain management regulations to the county city or village with zoning jurisdiction over the floodprone area therefore the mayor and city council of the city of gothenburg nebraska ordains as follows bfindings of fact 1flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the flood hazard areas of gothenburg nebraska are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by athe cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities  bthe occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to others which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3methods used to analyze flood hazards this chapter uses a reasonable method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps aselection of a regulatory flood which is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood is selected for this chapter it is representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a 1% chance of occurrence in any 1 year as delineated on the federal insurance administrations flood insurance study and illustrative materials dated  as amended bcalculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the base flood ccomputation of the floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than 1 foot at any point ddelineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no obstruction is permitted which would cause any water surface increase along the floodway profile edelineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but which still is subject to inundation by the base flood cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize those losses described in division b1 above by applying the provisions of this chapter to 1restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities 2require that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction 3protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazard 4assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance in the national flood insurance program

shall be permitted except upon the issuance of a floodplain permit to develop granted by the city of gothenburg or its duly designated representative under such safeguards and restrictions as the city

interpretation of district boundaries the boundaries of the floodway and flood fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on the official zoning map or on the flood insurance rate map or floodway map where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts as shown on the official zoning map as for example where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions the enforcement officer shall make the necessary interpretation in such cases where the interpretation is contested the board of adjustment will resolve the dispute the regulatory flood elevation for the point in question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land the person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case to the board of adjustment and to submit his or her own technical evidence if he or she so desires dcompliance

other applicable regulations eabrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this chapter to repeal abrogate or impair any existent easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter imposes greater restrictions the provision of this chapter shall prevail all other ordinances inconsistent with this chapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only finterpretation in their interpretation and application the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes gwarning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this chapter does not imply that areas outside floodway and flood fringe district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage this chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city of gothenburg or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder hseverability if any section clause provision or portion of this chapter is adjudged unconstitutional or
