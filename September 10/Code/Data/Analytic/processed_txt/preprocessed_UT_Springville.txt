slopes exceeding twentyfive percent 25% if the following requirements are met athe road has been approved and is either an existing city street or detailed plans showing the precise location and engineering detail have been submitted and approved by the city council after recommendation of the planning commission bthe planning commission and city council have determined that the proposed alignment is necessary for the proper development of the area and that there is no feasible alternate alignment which complies with the slope requirement cthe plan provides adequate measures to insure that all cut and fill slopes will be stabilized that erosion hazards will be eliminated that surface vegetation will be restored and that other environmental hazards will be adequately handled 2each dwelling site shall contain a buildable area of not less than four thousand 4000 square feet 3no cut or fill slope that shall be created as a part of the construction of any roadway dwelling or other structure shall exceed the critical angle of repose except by special permission of the city council after recommendation of the planning commission such special permission shall not be given until the developer shows that he has adopted all practical measures to reduce the slopes to less than the critical angle of repose by selecting an alternate location or by planting the slopes with natural vegetation or by undertaking other action which will have the effect of preventing the soil from moving under the force of gravity until vegetation becomes established 4all development shall provide to the satisfaction of the planning commission for the disposal of surface water originating as a result of any modification in the environment provision shall also be made to the satisfaction of the planning commission for the accommodation of all storm water runoff arising on or above the site so as to prevent flooding or erosion 5if it determines it to be necessary in order to adequately evaluate any proposed development in the hillside overlay zone the planning commission may require an environmental impact statement containing the information specified in a geologic report

concerning the westfields and lakeside communities this will help create attractive diverse neighborhoods including a wide variety of attached and detached quality housing along with opportunities for shopping and services all within reasonable walking distance for the majority of area residents 1this purpose can be achieved by aproviding a network of connected streets and paths that will provide adequate circulation for both pedestrians and vehicles and encourage a less autodependent community  bproviding a broad range of housing including suburban residences to urbantype apartments and townhouses throughout the area  cproviding significant open space consisting of formal parks located throughout the residential area and squares located in the village center along with a network of trails adjacent to waterways and the power corridor  and ddeveloping streets that balance the needs of vehicles pedestrians and residents 2examples of architectural features and building siting specifically identified as being desirable are found in some sections of springvilles plat a neighborhoods which may serve as a source of concepts and ideas to emulate neighborhoods should be created

wireless services antennas and related electronic equipment and structures 2to provide for the orderly establishment of personal wireless services facilities in the city 3to minimize the number of antenna support structures by encouraging the use of stealth facilities by encouraging the colocation of multiple antennas on a single structure by encouraging the location of antennas on preexisting support structures and by encouraging the use of cityowned property for antenna support structures 4to establish siting appearance and safety standards that will help mitigate potential impacts related to the construction use and maintenance of personal wireless services facilities 5to comply with the telecommunications act of 1996 by establishing regulations that a do not prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services b do not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services and c are not based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent that such facilities comply with the federal communication commissions regulations concerning such emissions 116402 findings the planning commission and city council establish the following findings 1personal wireless services are of increasing importance and value to the citizens of springville the growing industry and evolving technology continue to increase the quality of life for city residents and contribute to the public safety health and welfare of the city accommodating the expansions of networks and transmission facilities is important to creating a wellconnected functioning city 2excessive proliferation of wireless transmission facilities can have negative impacts on the residents and neighborhoods they serve particularly aesthetic impacts balancing the benefits of transmission facilities with the costs or impacts provides unique zoning challenges for the city 3the city needs to balance the interests and desires of the telecommunications industry and its customers to provide competitive and effective telecommunications systems in the city against the sometimes differing interests and desires of others concerning health safety welfare aesthetics and orderly planning of the community 4the city has experienced an increased demand for personal wireless services facilities to be located in the city and expects the increased demand to continue into the future 5the visual effects of personal wireless services facilities can be mitigated by fair standards regulating their siting construction maintenance and use 6the city owns numerous large parcels of property spread throughout the city that provide opportunities to locate transmission facilities that are contextually less obtrusive than other privately owned sites and provide possible sources of income that can offset other costs to city residents 7encouraging personal wireless services facilities to be located on city property with lease payments paid to the city instead of an individual property owner indirectly compensates all citizens of the community for the adverse impacts of the facilities and is therefore one of the fairest methods of distributing burden and benefit 8spacing transmission towers evenly throughout the city rather than clustering towers reduces the disproportionate negative impacts otherwise borne by adjacent properties 9because of the height and appearance of some personal wireless services facilities surrounding properties bear a disproportionate share of the negative impacts of a telecommunications tower a private property owner who leases space for a personal wireless services facility is the only one who receives compensation for the facility while neighboring property owners generally take the brunt of negative impacts associated with the facilities 10consideration of locating facilities on buildings structures existing towers or as stealth facilities reduces the negative impacts of transmission facilities as exposed standalone facilities these approaches more often effectively mitigate the negative impacts than the erection of additional towers the city does however acknowledge that there may be situations where a taller structure can reduce the need for a number of smaller facilities and can be less obtrusive than the collective impact of the smaller structures 11buildings and structures on public property are capable of being used to provide support for antenna arrays thus reducing the need for additional towers in all areas of the city 12the public policy objectives to reduce the proliferation of telecommunication towers and to mitigate their impact can best be facilitated by encouraging the use of less visually intrusive antennas and permitting the locating of wireless communication systems on telecommunication towers and antenna support structures that are colocated 13the requirements set forth in this ordinance for the placement of personal wireless services facilities are necessary to protect the heath safety and general welfare of the community 14springville city recognizes the significance of its nationally registered historic district and other historic resources in the city that are potentially impacted by wireless transmission facilities mitigation of the negative impacts in the district and near historical resources is a high priority monopoles and other towers should be avoided on public properties within the historic district and should be prohibited on private properties within the historic district additionally applications affecting the district and other resources on or eligible for the national register are subject to federal and state regulations including of the national historic preservation act 15transmission facilities are subject to state and federal laws that include possible requirements for wireless providers to make room on transmission facilities for collocation of other carriers as well as local government authority to create or acquire sites to accommodate the erection of telecommunication towers this authority allows a city to promote the location of telecommunication towers in a manageable area and to protect the aesthetics and environment of the area 116403 definitions the following words shall have the described meaning when used in this unless a contrary meaning is
