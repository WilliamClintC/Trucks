engineer and a consulting hydrogeologist based upon substantial and state of the art field studies and evaluation of the specific sinkhole system the planning commission may have such studies reviewed by the citys engineer 3 development in sinkhole drainage areas development may occur in the immediate sinkhole drainage area if the developer provides alternative surface drainage away from the sinkhole while keeping the water in the same surface drainage basin and provided further that the water shall not go into another sinkhole drainage area off the petitioners property nor into another stream of known flooding problems the immediate sinkhole drainage area or portion thereof which cannot be provided with an alternative drainage system can be deleted from the development area and be used to meet the normal open space requirements the developer may request that the planning commission increase the density on the remainder of the developable area with the total resulting density no greater than if the entire area were developed to the permitted density for portions of the immediate sinkhole drainage area where alternative surface drainage methods cannot be provided as determined by the citys engineer the developer may choose one of the options described in j4 herein below 4 sinkhole surface drainage analyses the sinkhole can be used for surface runoff drainage of a proposed

facilities as recommended by a consulting engineer and a consulting hydrogeologist provided that any increase in the quantity of surface runoff due to development of the entire sinkhole drainage area in question will not aggravate flooding on the proposed development adjacent existing development or connectedadjacent sinkhole subsurface systems such engineering and geological report must be

arterial street whenever a subdivision is proposed for property which abuts an arterial highway which is or is proposed to be four 4 lanes or more in width the developer may be required to dedicate sufficient rightofway to permit any necessary widening in consideration of the fact that such dedication requirement may exceed that which would ordinarily be required for subdivisions abutting local
