a significant impact uponwater resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the publicenjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scourdiminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing streamtemperature diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and watersupply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavymetals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewersdrainageways and other minor drainage facilities threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks andvolumes undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  50016 purpose and intent purpose the general

condominium developments purpose the city of prescott common council hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominiumdevelopments that require limited applicability of this chapter to condominium developmentsthe state legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply tocondominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiumsthat are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to adeclaration of condominium the factor that makes this chapter applicable to a condominium development is the creationof multiple distinct property entities at or near the ground surface subject to property taxation  city of prescott wi ecode360  408685 a b c d 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 b 1 2 c a as separate parcels with each property entity having different ownership and managementthe city determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar bothphysically and in ownership from developments in which the land and improvements areunder unitary ownership management and control thus the common council hereby finds that new condominium developments can placeimpacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which arecharacterized by division of land into lots these impacts include additional population density possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the lands characteristics additional demands upon city area parks recreation areas utility facilities and schools additional traffic and street use portions of chapter applicable to condominium
