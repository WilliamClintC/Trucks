washington county  chapter 205  zone of benefit recovery charges tmc 25010  legislative findings 1 the city of tualatin generally requires developers to construct and install necessary water sanitary sewer storm sewer and street improvements as a condition of approval the city and the commission also construct water sewer and street improvements as part of their capital improvement projects these improvements are generally constructed in accordance with city design and construction standards and later dedicated to the city as public improvements most of these street water sewer and storm sewer improvements particularly those constructed offsite can and will be used by nearby property owners when they develop their property and therefore represent a benefit to such nearby property owners 2 the city presently has three separate ordinances which offer some assistance to the developer who constructs necessary public improvements which benefit nearby property owners to the extent the latter are relieved of corresponding obligations when they develop these ordinances generally require the person who installs improvements to request that a refund agreement be entered into with the city whereby those who are relieved of obligations to construct the same public improvements will be required by the city to pay a separate connection charge when they develop their property and thereby contribute toward the cost of installing improvements which benefit both properties 3 this ordinance is intended to provide a uniform mechanism whereby the developers the city and the commission who install necessary water sewer street and storm sewer improvements which specially benefit other nearby property may request the city to formally examine and if appropriate require the owner of such benefited property to contribute some portion of the cost when the latter owner develops their property 4 the improvements which are constructed must be installed in accordance with city standards and inspected by or under the direction of city inspectors or in accordance with the citys inspection policy before they are eligible for acceptance by the city 5 the process used to establish a recovery charge under this ordinance also offers property owners who would be required to pay a future recovery charge for such improvements the opportunity to examine and comment on the proposal during a city council hearing the decision by the council to establish a recovery charge in a given case is not intended to be a land use decision rather it recognizes the private benefit that has been conferred by a developer on a neighboring property and offers a way of sharing those costs 6 the recovery charges that are ultimately established by the city are in addition to other charges which may be required of developers such as system development charges traffic impact fees inspection fees building permit fees other improvementrelated fees and connection charges and taxes the recovery charges established under this ordinance represent a cost associated with development which is specifically related to the impact created by new development and the costs of accommodating that impact 7 the recovery charge established under this ordinance is not an assessment against property and in fact does not become due and payable unless and until the subject property is connected to an improvement for purposes of development 8 the recovery charges established in this chapter are intended to be charged upon the act of development by whomever seeks the permit such charges are fees for service because they contemplate a developments receipt of essential municipal services based upon the nature of that development the timing and extent of any development are within the control and discretion of the developer furthermore the recovery charges imposed by this ordinance are not intended to be a tax on property or on a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of property within the meaning of of the oregon constitution or the legislation implementing that section 9 recovery charges established under this ordinance and paid to the developer who constructs improvements which benefit another property provide a method for more specifically adjusting the improvement requirements imposed on a developer according to the impact created by new development or assumed by the city or commission in their capital projects this also serves the purpose of providing reasonable compensation to the developer who constructs the beneficial improvements and thus assists in avoiding disputes over property rights    tmc 25020  short title authority and applicability 1 this ordinance shall be known as the recovery charge  2 the city of tualatin adopts this ordinance pursuant to the oregon constitution the city of tualatin charter of 196 ors  3 this ordinance shall apply throughout the city  tmc 25030  purpose the purpose of this ordinance is to provide a mechanism where property which has been benefited by the construction of certain improvements by another property owner or the city or the commission will share in the cost of those improvements of a recovery charge to the city at the time the benefited property is developed and the improvements are utilized this ordinance will provide a mechanism for the city to examine the improvements which are constructed their cost the properties which are specially benefited by them and a reasonable method of apportioning the reimbursable costs among benefited properties property owners whose property would be subject to the recovery charge fee will be provided an opportunity to review and comment on pertinent information prior to the city establishing a recovery charge pursuant to this ordinance the city will endeavor to collect recovery charges and upon receipt will forward such funds less a fee for administration to the person who constructed the improvements    tmc 25040  definitions as used in this ordinance the

chapter 206  systems development charges tmc 26010  legislative findings the council of the city of tualatin finds determines and declares that 1 of the city charter of 1967 as amended grant the city authority to impose systems development charges sdc to equitably spread the cost of essential capital improvements to new development 2 given the mobility of the population and the geographic size of the city most capital improvement projects benefit new development regardless of where in the city it occurs the entire communitys health may be affected if adequately sized water services public parks and recreation areas and other capital improvements are not provided in all locations of the city and its environs development is occurring throughout the entire city and no single area of the city is experiencing such a high level of new development activity to require sdc revenue from development in one area be dedicated to that same area it is more cost efficient to use sdc revenue from new development in the entire community to finance the growth related portion of capital improvements based upon a citywide priority rather than to hold the sdc revenue generated in one area of the community for improvements just in that area 3 the imposition of connection fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that development bears a proportionate share of the cost of capital facilities necessary to accommodate such development this must be done in order to promote and protect the public health safety and welfare 4 the report entitled report of water supply system improvements through a systems development charge for the city of tualatin dated  and prepared by the engineering and building department of the city water sdc methodology sets forth a reasonable methodology and analysis for the determination of the impact of new development on the need and costs for additional water system improvements 5 the report entitled park system development charge methodology for the city of tualatin adopted  as prepared by community attributes inc establishes the methodology and analysis for the determination of the impact of new development on the need and costs for additional parkland and related improvements 6 whenever the city council has authorized an intergovernmental agreement which requires the city to impose an sdc the city council may by resolution approve the methodology impose the charge and thereafter the city may collect and expend the revenue as though the same were city capital improvements and funds as provided in this ordinance or any future amendment 7 the systems development charges established in this section are intended to be charges upon the act of development by whomever seeks the permit such charges are fees for service because they contemplate a developments receipt of essential municipal services based upon the nature of that development the timing and extent of any development are within the control and discretion of the developer 8 the sdc imposed by this ordinance is not intended to be a tax on property or on a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of property within the meaning of of the oregon constitution or the legislation implementing that section 9 even if the sdc imposed is viewed under of the oregon constitution as a tax against property or against a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of that property it is an incurred charge within the meaning of that section and the statutes implementing it because a it allows the owner to control the quantity of the service by determining the extent of development to occur upon the property b it allows the owner to determine when the service is to be initiated or increased by controlling when the development occurs c state law and the ordinances of this city require the owner to provide certain basic utility and infrastructure services to the property when it is developed for human occupancy the provision of these basic services are a routine obligation of the owner of the affected property and essential to the health and safety of the community 10 among the basic services which the city is required to provide its residents are the capital improvements as defined in this ordinance 11 the sdc imposed by this ordinance is based upon the costs of providing existing or planned for capital improvements and does not impose charges on persons not receiving a service and imposing a burden upon the citys existing capital improvements 12 where this ordinance or the methodology used to establish a sdc permits a credit to be given for the dedication to or for the benefit of the public of a portion of the permittees property or the property of another which is obtained by the permittee such credit provides reasonable compensation to the permittee and thus assists in avoiding disputes over the acquisition of such property 13 because water system improvements contemplated as part of the citys capital improvement plan include a c level reservoir and storage capacity within the system can be moved between and among the citys water service levels as needed increased capacity at one service level improves the capacity of the system and therefore the systems development charge imposed under is intended to be collected as part of a systems development charge for water system improvements within the city those persons who have previously paid the charge imposed under who would be subject to the payment of sdcs under this ordinance shall be eligible for credit against the water system development charge    11419 tmc 26020  title authority and applicability 1 this ordinance shall be known as the systems development charge  2 the city of tualatin has the authority to

ultimately require extensive reconstruction for substantially greater cost 3 historically the city has devoted its road fund revenues to new street and intersection construction and minor maintenance since the greatest percentage of roads under city jurisdiction are relatively new historically revenues have not been budgeted for aggressive road maintenance as proposed by the plan therefore although the city considers the maintenance of its streets to be a proprietary function the expenditures required for aggressive road maintenance are different than those historically budgeted from general fund revenues 4 the cost of road reconstruction far exceeds the cumulative cost of aggressive road maintenance current revenue sources available to the city such as the systems development charges and the citys share of fuel and weightmile taxes are addressing the need for expansion of capacity elimination of certain hazard locations and minor maintenance no revenue source exists however to adequately fund maintenance of the citys streets according to the plan there exists an average revenue shortfall of $30000000 annually within the road fund for pavement management 5 like road maintenance expenditures the city has no identified regular source of funds to cover the cost of electricity and maintenance for its street lights with a current cost of $10800000 annually the citys road fund shows an average revenue shortfall of $5000000 annually for street lighting 6 in 198 the city council commissioned a study by ch2m hill to examine the various funding options available to the city for road maintenance identified in the plan and for street lighting and to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each the ch2m hill report dated december 198 and entitled city of tualatin road maintenance and street lighting funding study study recommended the city establish a utility based revenue source so as to best address citizen desires for equity revenue stability and flexibility such a system is deemed most appropriate for apportioning the cost of local road maintenance in relation to the impact of a particular use of property served by the local road system the benefit obtained by a property from regular local road maintenance is closely related to the use that the property makes of city streets as measured by trip generation of developed properties 7 it is anticipated that each city street will receive routine maintenance services every year in addition many city streets will receive major maintenance service such as a chip seal or overlay within the next 11 years unless these activities are funded budgeted and appropriated thereby properly maintaining city streets  the public health safety and welfare will be seriously jeopardized 8 the council finds the following source documents to be generally accepted and reliable for use in implementing the terms of this ordinance a trip generation 7th edition published by the institute of transportation engineers ite manual and b the city of tualatin pavement management plan dated  as updated 9 since the pavement management plan identifies a need to generate $30000000 per year over the next 11 years and the next largest unfunded expense within the road fund is the cost of street lighting the council determined that the unfunded needs of these two programs would be $35000000 it was further assumed that these costs would rise gradually as the city street system grows and the city builds and accepts more streets and street lights the city council established a goal of funding the entire average annual projected cost of street maintenance according to the pavement management plan as well as $5000000 or approximately onehalf of the current cost of street lighting the ratio of one to seven should be used in the future as a benchmark for allocating revenues from the road utility fee collected under this ordinance to the expenditures for road maintenance and street lighting 10 funds received under this ordinance shall be placed in the citys road fund and dedicated and used exclusively for street maintenance including sidewalk repair landscape enhancements along the rightsofway street tree replacement and street lighting and for no other purpose as more specifically outlined in tmc 34100 11 the adoption of this ordinance and the levying of charges and fees hereunder are adopted pursuant to the authority contained in the oregon constitution the city of tualatin charter of 196     2205   tmc 34030  creation of road utility and dedication of revenue to road fund 1 a road utility within the road fund is created for the purpose of maintenance of city streets which includes repairing sidewalks under a sidewalk maintenance program landscape enhancements along the rightsofway street tree replacement and for paying the operating cost of street lights 2 all funds collected pursuant to this be allocated to the citys road fund the portion of the road fund that represents the fees collected under this chapter during a given year fees carried over from prior years and investment earnings from the fees shall be used to operate and administer the citys street maintenance program which includes repairing sidewalks under a sidewalk maintenance program landscape enhancements along the rightsofway replacing street trees and to pay the cost of lighting city streets the fees paid and collected must be reasonably related to the cost of providing street maintenance and street lighting and generate revenues that are required to provide those services pursuant to the plan to the extent that road utility fees collected are insufficient to properly maintain local streets the cost may be paid from such other nondedicated city funds as may be allocated by the city council but the city council may direct the reimbursement to such fund if additional fees are collected all amounts on hand in the road fund including those collected pursuant to this be invested by the finance director in accordance with state law earnings from such investments shall also be dedicated to the road fund 3 it is not necessary that the operations administration and maintenance expenditures from the road fund for street maintenance and lighting purposes specifically relate to any particular property from which the fees for such purposes were collected the fees shall not be used for other governmental or proprietary purposes of the city except to pay for an equitable share of the citys accounting management and other governing costs incident to operation of the street maintenance program and the lighting of city streets otherwise the fees and charges shall be used solely to pay for the cost of operation administration maintenance repair improvement renewal replacement and reconstruction of city streets and related facilities and the actual costs of electricity and maintenance of city street lights 4 revenues collected under this ordinance will be budgeted within the city road fund between expenditures for street maintenance and the operation and maintenance of city street lighting on the basis of approximately 67ths for street maintenance and 17th for street lighting revenues received for future years maintenance under the plan will be reserved     2205   tmc 34040  definitions as used in this the following means city manager means the

   2205       tmc 34120  determination and application of rates 1 to determine the road utility fee for each owner occupant tenant agent or other authorized representative responsible for occupancy of a property the city manager must determine the appropriate customer group use category number of trips generated and gross floor area for each property and apply the rates set by council 2 the city manager must determine the appropriate customer group based on the use of the property and the trips generated per thousand square feet of development with reference to the ite manual 3 the city manager must determine the appropriate use category of each developed property as follows a apply the use category from the ite manual that best represents the use of the property b in the absence of a specific use category from within the ite manual for a particular developed use the city manager must determine the appropriate category by interpreting the ite manual and assigning the category which most accurately reflects the use of the particular property based upon the following factors i the size of the site and the building  ii the number of employees  iii other developed sites operated by the same or an affiliated owner for a use generating comparable amounts of traffic  iv other developed sites operated by a different owner for a use generating comparable amounts of traffic  v the number of work shifts  vi the number of hours of operation  and vii the planning district designation c in lieu of or in addition to the factors in subsection b for determining the use category the city manager may require and consider the results of a traffic study conducted in accordance with the methodology outlined in the ite manual and provided the study includes on site traffic counts not less than twice nor more than four times during the year immediately following the beginning of operation on site d in furtherance of this rule the city manager may assign a use category on an interim basis provided it is not less than the lowest use category among available residential or nonresidential groups e the determination of use category is not a land use decision as that term is defined in ors  4 for nonresidential customer groups after determining the appropriate use category for a developed property the city manager must use the estimated vehicle trip generation figures for the assigned use category from the ite manual and designate the developed property to a particular customer group based on the estimated number of vehicle trips in the ite manual for that use category 5 for each nonresidential customer group the city manager must determine the gross floor area measured in thousands of square feet or fractions of thousand square feet as follows a the sum in square feet of the area of each floor level in the building including cellars basements mezzanines penthouses corridors lobbies stores and offices that are within the principal outside faces of exterior walls not including architectural setbacks or projections included are all areas that have floor surfaces with clear standing head room six feet six inches minimum regardless of their use b if a groundlevel area or part thereof within the principal outside faces of the exterior walls is not enclosed this gross floor area is considered part of the overall square footage of the building c unroofed areas and unenclosed roofedover spaces except those contained within the principle outside faces of exterior walls are excluded from the gross floor area calculations d parking garages within the building are excluded from the gross floor area calculations 6 for the nonresidential customer group when uses of property under the ite manual are analyzed according to acreage rather than square footage the city manager must convert the ite manual trip generation rates to a square footage calculation and calculate the road utility fee based on the square footage calculation if conversion to a square footage calculation is not practical then the city manager may assign a special trip generation rate for an individual parcel  tmc 34130  mixed uses and related properties 1 mixed uses within a single building and related properties are not entitled to apportionment of the road utility fee bill unless the separate uses contain separate water meters and sewer services 2 for each separate use the city manager will determine the appropriate customer group use category number of trips generated and gross floor area as set forth in tmc 34120 determination and application of rates 3 the city manager will then apply the rates set by council as appropriate for each separate use the road utility fee for each separate use will then be billed with the water and sewer services account related to the separate use 4 although these standards will generally apply to nonresidential uses they may be used to determine the appropriate use category or customer group for mixed uses which consist of residential and nonresidential uses  tmc 34140  application of road utility fee to certain properties the application of the road utility fee under of this certain properties is as follows 1 cityowned parking lots which are not associated with public services other than parking are not subject to the road utility fee as they do not generate traffic in and of themselves 2 parking lots owned and operated by trimet for mass transit passengers such as park and ride are not subject to the road utility fee as they serve a purpose of reducing overall trip generation use of public transportation 3 publicly owned park land open spaces and greenways are not be subject to the road utility fee unless public offstreet parking designed to accommodate the use of such areas is provided 4 areas used for commercial farming or forestry operations will be billed according to the predominant use of any structures on the site where a site is used exclusively for farming or forestry and not for residential or commercial uses the site shall not be subject to the road utility fee where there is more than one developed use on the site the use category shall be determined by examining the predominant use which shall be the use which is made on the property for the longest portion of the year where more than one use is made of a farming or forestry site and two or more uses predominate then each use must be examined separately as set forth in tmc 34130 mixed uses and related properties and a combination of use categories will be used to determine the road utility fee 5 areas encompassing railroad and public rightofway are not subject to the road utility fee 6 railroad property containing structures such as maintenance areas nonrolling storage areas and areas used for the transfer of rail transported goods to nonrail transport are subject to road utility fees 7 road utility fees imposed under this to all developed property including developed property owned by local state federal governments as well as property which may be entitled to exemption from or deferral of ad valorem property taxation 8 the fees imposed under this due

for the city of tualatin  tmc 66020  purpose construction and scope 1 the occupants of numerous residential commercial and industrial establishments within the corporate limits of the city of tualatin have found it desirable to make provisions for the installation upon their premises at their own cost and expense of alarm systems for emergencies requiring police response 2 there is a growing number of private enterprises that have embarked upon the business of selling or leasing such alarm systems entering into contract with such occupants for the installation operation and maintenance of such alarm systems and providing either individually or in concert with other private business enterprises an alarm device or devices installed in various alarm monitoring centers likewise there is a growing number of private enterprises that have embarked upon the business of selling such alarm systems where the installation is completed by the purchaser or the user 3 the proliferation of the number of private enterprises engaged in the distribution of alarm systems and the number of commercial and residential users of such systems has resulted in conditions that if not remedied will lead to an unnecessary drain on the manpower time space facilities and finances of the city and its police services and a deterioration of the quality of police service to the citys residents 4 the public interest therefore requires the enactment of rules regulations standards and procedures to regulate and control the private alarm business within the corporate limits of the city of tualatin for the following purposes a the tualatin police department may efficiently and economically coordinate its functions with the various alarm services to which the public within the city may subscribe  b the quality of the alarm services rendered to the public may be improved and maintained at a high level  c the excessive number of false alarms which require expenditure of police resources must be reduced so that those limited resources may be more efficiently utilized  d those private enterprises engaged in the alarm business and persons who utilize alarm systems should help support the administration of the alarm system and where alarm users are responsible for an excessive number of false alarms they should pay additional charges which relate to the additional responses by the police and motivate alarm users to reduce the number of false alarms  e those alarms users who are responsible for excessive false alarms and who fail or refuse to remedy the cause of excessive false alarms demonstrate their indifference to limited police resources being devoted to unnecessary emergency responses and such users should be treated by punitive measures by the time an alarm users system has generated ten false alarms within a permit year the police response by way of notices will have provided the user with ample warning of the consequences and therefore it is presumed the alarm user has failed to take adequate steps to remedy the problem and maintain the alarm system 5 the purpose of this ordinance is to encourage alarm users and alarm businesses to assume increased responsibility for maintaining the mechanical reliability and the proper use of alarm systems to prevent unnecessary police emergency responses to false alarms and thereby protect the emergency response capability of the city from misuse 6 except where otherwise expressly provided this ordinance governs all alarm systems eliciting a police response requires annual permits establishes fees

              chapter 2  introduction tdc   background 1 the city of tualatins first comprehensive plan was adopted in 197 59 years after the city was incorporated in 1913 in 197 the city adopted a plan for the citys urban renewal area and then produced a more detailed renewal plan in 1977 since the adoption of the 1972 plan the city has seen rapidly changing circumstances that have created the need for a revised plan these circumstances included the establishment of the state land conservation and development commission lcdc adoption of the statewide planning goals annexation of most of the industrial area west of the city in 198 and accelerated economic development that has occurred since 1972 in the tualatin area 2 in 197 the oregon legislature passed a law establishing the land conservation and development commission lcdc and empowered the commission to adopt statewide planning goals the legislature also required all oregon cities and counties to adopt plans and ordinances in conformance with the statewide goals and to coordinate their plans with each affected local general purpose government or special district each city or county also had to prepare a plan that considered state and federal government programs to help each local government prepare a plan to meet the planning goals the state legislature allocated considerable sums of money to provide planning grants to the local jurisdictions this planning effort has been achieved by using some of those grant funds 3 while the statewide planning goals were being formulated the nation was recovering from an economic recession tualatin was only beginning to feel the double impact of renewed economic growth at the same time development of the metropolitan urban fringe finally reached and went beyond tualatins border because of these factors the city is now experiencing an unprecedented development boom that must be guided by an adequate plan that will ensure the longterm livability of the city while the 1972 plan was adequate for its time a new plan building on the strengths of the old plan was necessary to provide an adequate guide for current and future city growth 4 after six years of work tualatin adopted a revised comprehensive plan on  which with amendments was acknowledged as being in compliance with the statewide goals and guidelines by the lcdc on  5 the tualatin plan is unique in that it involves a single document integrating both the traditional comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance into a single development code this direction is followed in the land use mapping by having only one map with planning districts rather than a zone map and a plan map with this approach tualatin provides a very strong legal authority to its planning programs 6 the 1979 tualatin plan dealt with land both within the city limits and in the unincorporated area out to the metropolitan service district metro urban growth boundary ugb however the acknowledgement of the plan by the lcdc was only for the city limits therefore the 1979 plan was termed complementary in that it dealt only with land inside the limits and left the growth areas reaching to the ugb to washington county for detailed planning and administration it was the countys responsibility to finalize the plan for this area so that it could be acknowledged by the lcdc 7 planning responsibility shifted to the city with the october 1982 annexation of most of the industrial planning area at that time tualatin and washington county agreed that the city would assume planning responsibility for the unincorporated balance of the planning area in order to fulfill this responsibility the city prepared two separate land use plan amendments one for the newly annexed industrial area and another for the unincorporated predominantly residential balance of the planning area at the same time the city prepared updates to the transportation and sewer and water elements of the public facilities plan these three amendments scheduled for adoption in 198 were intended to bring the total plan into active status this means that the city was taking authority for its own growth lands and is planning for those lands so that they can be best integrated into one community 8 map 92 shows the western industrial district the industrial planning area and the individual industrial areas 9 map 92 shows the

while accommodating economic growth specifically the plan is intended to define locations for both private and public land uses and to arrange these uses in a manner that reduces conflicts and provides convenient movement between individual land uses the plan is also intended to provide for diverse living and working environments of the highest quality 2 when adopted by the city council

involvement goal this goal provides that each community must adopt implement and periodically review a citizen involvement program in 197 the tualatin city council appointed a seven member committee for citizen involvement cci to draft a citizen involvement program this program was adopted by the city council on  and has been the basis for the citys citizen involvement activities after the adoption of the citizen involvement program the city council formed two new advisory committees to provide recommendations to the council on planning matters these new groups were the tualatin planning advisory committee tpac which became the planning commission in 201 and the urban renewal advisory committee urac urac provides planning assistance to the tualatin development commission on matters within the urban renewal area and the planning commission provides planning recommendations for the general community 2 the city council transferred the citizen involvement program responsibility to the tualatin planning advisory committee in 1976 this responsibility was transferred to the tualatin planning commission in 2012 3 another advisory group influencing the plan is the tualatin park advisory committee tpark this committee oversees the citys park and recreation programs and thus has an interest in the park and recreation element of the public facilities plan which is also reflected on the communitys general land use plan both tpac changed to the tualatin planning commission and tpark have met regularly to review the plan proposals and to take actions recommending this plan to the city council meeting minutes and recordings are available for public review at the tualatin city hall the powers duties and organizational structure of tpac changed to the tualatin planning commission and tpark are described in the tualatin municipal    tdc    reserved editors note adopted  repealed   and  tdc   agency coordination 1 numerous public agencies have been involved in the planning process this plan as well as phase i technical memoranda the data base for this plan and subsequent modifications to this plan were sent to the following public agencies for comment this coordination is required by statewide planning legislation and agency comments are on file at the tualatin city hall a land conservation and development commission b columbia region association

telephone company of the northwest inc b northwest natural gas company c portland general electric company d comcast   062705   chapter 3  technical memoranda tdc   background 1 the development of the plan for tualatin was based as much as possible on objective data that measured conditions within the planning area to obtain this data the planning process was divided into two phases with the first phase being data collection and the second phase being the preparation of a plan based on the collected data the data was collected in a document entitled phase itechnical memoranda the technical memoranda described data concerning numerous topics those topics are described as follows a citizen involvement citizen participation b land use natural resource inventory geological resources flood plains drainage and wetlands fishery resources wildlife resources wetland protection regulations ecologically significant natural areas vegetation soils inventory urbanrural conflicts air quality pollution potentials noise quality pollution potentials groundwater resources high groundwater and weak soils historical and cultural resource inventory land use summary existing land use buildable land summary residential commercial and industrial demand population forecast housing commercialindustrial urbanization housing inventory energy conservation c public facilities transportation public services water supply sewerage storm drainage flooding and natural hazards recreation and open space schools electrical gas and utilities 2 to portray material lending itself to graphic description a series of clear mylar overlays were produced this series of overlays was useful in describing to the advisory committees and the public much of the information necessary to reach planning decisions the graphic overlays cover the following topics and are available for review at the tualatin city hall a slope analysis indicates areas that may be natural hazard areas b soils classifications indicates areas that may be natural hazard areas c water areas and wetlands indicates areas that may be natural hazard areas d vegetation and wildlife e recreation and open space inventory f street classifications and capacities g major street inventory h existing land use i water service areas j sewer service areas 3 to briefly acquaint the reader with some of the data that has been used in the plan the following summary has been written the summary briefly describes the data and initial findings produced in the first planning phase for a detailed review of data used in this plan please refer directly to phase itechnical memoranda city of tualatin historic resource technical study and inventory 19921993 city of tualatin natural resource inventory and local wetlands inventory 199 2001 transportation system plan tsp and 2012 tsp update tsp technical memorandum december 2012 and nw tualatin concept plan 2005    tdc   citizen participation two questionnaires were used to aid the development of planning objectives one assessed general community attitudes and asked residents to list tualatins assets and liabilities the other polled commercial and industrial employees in the planning area regarding the need for housing for people who work in tualatin tdc   natural resources renewable and nonrenewable natural resources were listed along with an inventory of soil types air pollution potentials and noise pollution potentials 1 geology a uplands the southern half of the study area consists of irregular uplands varying from 250 feet to 550 feet in relief with several small creeks draining to the north these uplands grade into a northwardsloping terrace at an estimated elevation of 250 feet b lowlying areas columbia river basalt underlies the valley and is covered with a finegrain sedimentary material consisting of silts and clays flooddeposited sand gravel and boulders occur over some parts of the area c tualatin river the tualatin river originates on the eastern slope of the coast range the watershed averages 40 miles long and 25 miles wide draining 711 square miles before entering the willamette river about 12 of the watershed is in the valley where the stream is flat with wide flood plains d drainages numerous minor drainages into the tualatin river within the study area have required the development of a drainage plan for the city of tualatin major drainage basins within the study area are hedges creek and nyberg creek saum creek and athee creek also have substantial drainage areas within the planning area the majority of drainage structures within the city of tualatin are open ditches and creeks combined with culverts at road crossings e wetlands wetlands are mapped as areas of shallow groundwater tables subject to frequent inundation that have developed vegetation tolerant of abundant soil moisture wetlands are often transition areas between uplands and waterways these areas commonly store flood waters provide wildlife habitat and supply primary protection to the adjacent waterway ecosystems hedges creek wetland is the largest wetland area in washington county the army corps of engineers regulates any filling or dredging of the hedges creek wetland 2 fish a wide variety of fish live in the tualatin river system the river supports both migratory fish and resident fish populations a migratory migration lasts from late august to early september during low water periods flow of the tualatin river is diverted for irrigation and municipal water use upstream from the oregon iron and steel company dam when low flow periods extend into october and november migratory fish are prevented from entering the tualatin river increased flow from impoundment of the scoggins dam has improved fish passage conditions b resident warmwater fish caught near the city of tualatin are primarily largemouth bass bluegill brown bullhead and black crappies crayfish are a good indicator of water quality the crayfish population declined during the late 1950s and early 1960s 3 wildlife within the study area there are a variety of habitats that support diverse wildlife fauna the habitats are composed of a mosaic of forest grasslands wetlands and farm land the diverse and littledisturbed habitats provide living space for a wide variety of wildlife species the technical memoranda contains a detailed list of species of wildlife in the study area from the oregon department of fish and wildlife the areas of particular importance to wildlife species are wetlands and riverbank habitats along the tualatin river and its tributaries a hedges creek the large wetland directly west of the tualatin city center and south of the southern pacific railroad line is one of the most important ecologically significant natural areas this area has generated considerable interest because of its extensive wildlife and water fowl habitat in close proximity to portland b saum creek saum creek located at the eastern end of the study area contains both deciduous and coniferous forest land and is characterized by forests along the creek c tualatin river the tualatin river and its flood plain from the western boundary of the study area to just past its junction with fanno creek has been identified as a wetland and marsh area the river itself is an important fish migration route the river and its associated vegetation are important natural habitats d tualatin river national wildlife refuge the us fish and wildlife service established the refuge to protect enhance and manage an area of high quality and diverse habitats for a variety of migratory birds and resident fish and wildlife the 3090acre refuge is located in an area adjacent to the western city limits of tualatin and includes the rock creek drainage and onion flats area adjoining sw cipole road one tributary of rock creek originates within tualatins city limits in an area designated general manufacturing the refuge is of particular importance to tualatin and the metropolitan region as a fish and wildlife habitat and valuable open space 4 vegetation vegetation plays a crucial role in the natural processes it furnishes living space and food for animals cleanses the environment by acting as a filter for dust and air pollutants and binds the soil to prevent erosion a uplands both conifer forest and mixed coniferdeciduous forest are found on the upland areas cleared uplands support pasture or field crops b lowlands lowlands are characterized by riverbank forests swamp or marsh 5 soils soil types have been mapped from aerial photographs obtained from the soil conservation service soils are classified into eight broad groups designated by roman numerals i indicating progressively greater limitations for crop production soil classification expresses the suitability of soils for most kinds of field crops a fertility over 95 percent of the soils within the study area are within classes i the tualatin valley is a very fertile area with a long history of agricultural use b suitability most of the soils in the study area are not suitable for farming due to the potential for erosion high water tables or their shallow droughty nature 6 water quality in the past the major water quality problem in the city has been pollution of tualatin river waters a 1976 report prepared for the columbia region association of governments by portland state university states that the lower tualatin river appears to be nutrient enriched eutrophic but not polluted the report states that the improved water quality is due primarily to summer lowflow augmentation now allowed by the new scoggins dam and improved sewage treatment facilities recently constructed along the river consequently the citys major water pollution problem has been solved the city could have some water quality problems on tualatin river tributaries due to erosion during construction these problems are difficult to quantify however the city does have some control options over this potential problem  tdc   natural hazards 1 flooding the last three miles of the tualatin river about five and onehalf miles downstream from the city of tualatin consists of a narrow gorge with a vertical drop of nearly 40 feet natural reefs occurring upstream limit the rivers ability to pass flood flows the reefs create a natural dam forcing water to back up and flood into the tualatin valley a season flooding usually occurs between midnovember and midfebruary due to rainfall and snow melt unlike most oregon streams the wide flat flood plains of the tualatin valley store large volumes of water that cause the river to peak slowly and remain above flood stage for several days b affected area the core area of the city of tualatin is highly vulnerable to flooding of the tualatin river a 100year frequency flood would cause extensive flooding in the city of tualatin it would also flood a large area west and east of the citys downtown and a large area in the northwest portion of the study area c existing flood control present flood control projects on the willamette river do not appreciably affect flood conditions of the city of tualatin upstream flood control measures on the tualatin river will provide only limited benefits to the tualatin valley as the key physical constraints occur at the natural reefs downstream 2 air pollution the major source of air pollution in tualatin is motor vehicle traffic industrial sources are minor the durham sewerage treatment plant is the largest single point source of pollution in the area a existing air quality existing air quality in tualatin is estimated to be well within allowable limits everywhere except in the immediate vicinity of nyberg road and the freeway b future air quality projections to 1990 suggest that concentrations of all pollutants will meet standards due to increasingly effective emission controls on new vehicles 3 noise pollution a noise created by traffic is currently the citys most serious noise problem new industrial uses will increase industrial noise pollution potential b residential the control of traffic sounds near residential property needs to be required by ordinance this can be accomplished techniques such as buffering setbacks and vehicular noise control ordinances c industrial the citys present industrial noise control ordinance is very restrictive and should be reviewed d railroad specific control measures for railroad noise and vibration should be the subject of a study before action is taken on this potential problem 4 high groundwater a wetlands the high groundwater area approximates the tualatin river flood plain and encompasses all the present wetland area there are many areas of high groundwater with levels at or near the surface of the ground this is particularly true during the winter months when the river level is high and the wetlands are filled with standing water b weak soils the high groundwater is particularly troublesome in sandy soils as a quick condition may result during excavation for footings and utilities organic or plastic clays and peat all weak soils may be found almost anywhere throughout the high groundwater area particularly near present or past wetlands since weak soils can result in extraordinary construction requirements and methods any new construction in the high groundwater area should include a detailed soils investigation and report by a qualified soils engineer or engineering geologist c springs springs are prevalent along a line that approximates the southern boundary of the high groundwater area and at other areas identified in the technical memoranda any construction there requires special treatment to provide for drainage of the springs tdc   historical and cultural resources few reminders of the first settling and growth of tualatin remain 1 identified most of the buildings with historical value are in the downtown area the tualatin urban renewal plan identifies seven structures four residences one commercial building a church and the old city hall the urban renewal plan has designated a portion of the downtown as a historic district 2 unidentified there are numerous opportunities to identify historical sites by markers and remember early settlers by naming new developments for them avery street could be publicly recognized as an old indian trail preservation of the old structures and sites acknowledges them as a cultural resource tdc   land use 1 in august 197 an updated survey of existing land use within the study area was conducted by city staff this was done by a combination of driving the area utilizing previously developed land use information and checking against aerial photographs this information is mapped and summarized in the technical memoranda and is included in tables 31 32 and 33 of this plan as of september 197 approximately 46 percent of the land within the city was urbanized while only 15 percent of the land outside of the city was urbanized 2 also inventoried and analyzed was the amount of land in the study area zoned in various categories compared to land actually in use within the city limits approximately 45 percent of residential land 48 percent of commercial land and only 19 percent of industrial land is being utilized 3 an analysis was conducted to identify the amounts and locations of buildable land remaining within the study area a east generally most of the buildable land remaining within the city limits is located east of the i5 freeway since this area has not received city services development has been only in those areas which connect to a sanitary facility b south in the southern tualatin area much buildable land remains outside of the city limits in prime residential areas services to this area are close to potential new development and were the basis for the inclusion of this area within the immediate growth boundary c west in the west tualatin area most of the remaining buildable lands would easily serve industrial uses presently lack of sewer and water services and flooding problems have caused this area to remain undeveloped until these problems are solved industrial growth will be limited in this portion of the city additional residential growth can be accommodated in the west tualatin area north of tualatin road and west of 105th avenue table

employment 1 population the technical memoranda provides information on the factors relating to the economy of tualatin patterns of growth in the city of tualatin are related to trends in the 4county area comprising the portland smsa during the period of 1940 to 197 the population in the portland smsa approximately doubled the greatest population growth increase in the metropolitan area occurred in washington county population changes are a combined result of birth death and migration rapid growth patterns in the city of tualatin are due primarily to net migration tualatins rapid growth is attributable to several major factors a moratoriums and restrictive growth policies in surrounding larger jurisdictions  b availability of land for development in a rural area at less than normal market rates  c a buildup of industry and a need for housing  and d a municipal attitude supportive of developers 2 most of these factors are still in effect except that raw land prices are reaching market level restrictive growth policies unavailability of utilities and lengthy and costly development processing are still in effect in unincorporated washington county and clackamas county new industries the popularity of westside living and the availability of large parcels of land make tualatin attractive to developers the market pressures that were present during 1970 to 197 to develop in the tualatin area are still in force 3 two sets of population projections to the year 2000 were provided the larger approximately 29000 people is based on unrestricted market growth the smaller projection approximately 22000 people is a projection at an annual growth rate of 78 percent and assumes a controlled approach to community growth 4 housing indicators of housing growth in the city of tualatin include annexations housing starts land subdivision and lot development a existing housing in 1975 and 197 the center for population research and census at portland state university conducted a census in the city of tualatin the census data together with the data on annexations subdivisions and lot development in the city formed a basis for projecting future housing needs in 1976 the distribution of housing by type of unit was approximately 566 percent singlefamily 370 percent multifamily and 64 percent mobile homes b projected need i housing constructed over the next ten years is generally predictable in terms of type form and density longterm housing development is less predictable and given historical patterns it is realistic to assume that longterm housing development will take the form of smaller units and higher densities ii factors that will affect the longterm development of housing in the city are the mix between singlefamily and multifamily housing the declining household size the amount of household income and divorce rates if current predictions regarding the trends occurring in the region hold true it is estimated that between 1990 and 1995 a reversal in the current pattern of the ratio between singlefamily and multifamily housing will begin to occur by the year 200 it is projected that the city could actually have approximately 1300 more multifamily housing units than singlefamily housing units iii to convert projected housing starts into land requirements for planning purposes involves the development of assumptions about future housing types and densities these assumptions appear in community growth 5 employment a jobs in portland employment in the city of tualatin is closely tied to economic prospects in the portland metropolitan area there has been a rapid growth in the commercial and governmental categories in the portland area employment trends there reflect the shift from blue collar to white collar jobs in 197 20000 washington county residents were employed in finance insurance real estate and miscellaneous service jobs while in 1960 only 4000 of these jobs were available within the county b jobs in washington county in 1970 washington county had 49600 jobs half of the available jobs were in manufacturing primarily because tektronix employs 8500 to 9000 people in washington county although tualatin has more land in industrial zones than other communities of its size future industrial growth can be expected to slow down as the standards for development increase but by the year 200 an estimated 200 acres of future industrial land will be required in tualatin with current employment in industry at 1165 it is projected that by the year 2000 there will be 7210 industrial employees tdc   public facilities and services 1 transportation the following is a summary of the current condition of the transportation modes serving tualatin from the 2012 tualatin transportation system plan update tsp technical memorandum december 2012 a pedestrian pedestrian facility needs include fill sidewalk gaps on several arterials and collector streets  narrow or obstructed sidewalks  wide or angled crosswalks at intersections  and difficult crossing on major roadways sw boones ferry road sw tualatinsherwood road and roadways in the downtown core most of the pedestrian crashes reported in the 5year crash study time frame occurred on sw boones ferry road generally when a vehicle failed to yield for pedestrians most crashes occurred when a vehicle was turning b bicycle existing bicycle facilities in tualatin have a few gaps and challenging connections such as difficult leftturn maneuvers  constrained environment  difficult areas with low bike visibility  bike lanes outside of turn lanes  obstacles within the bike lanes  and gaps in the network in addition to these needs there are a number of highcrash locations most crashes result in an injury to the bicyclist and most occur on a dry roadway surface in daylight conditions highcrash locations include sw boones ferry road and sw tualatinsherwood road as well as the sw nyberg road interchange ramps at i5 c multiuse paths additional bicycle and pedestrian connections over the tualatin river are needed to connect with existing regional paths as well as to provide alternate routes to the one existing kiakuts bridge that is exclusively for bicycles and pedestrians from tualatin community park to durham city park in durham additionally many of the existing multiuse paths are fragmented and do not connect  signs and other wayfinding guides are needed to inform bicyclists or pedestrians how to move among the various pathways and from the pathways to onstreet facilities the planned multiuse path network is only half constructed  once the system is complete the multiuse path network will be more comprehensive d transit trimet does not provide transit service within all areas of tualatin or on all major corridors no transit service is provided on sw tualatinsherwood road or sw tualatin road and many residents in the western portion of the city live more than a mile from the nearest transit line many residents who do live near a bus line are not served by transit at regular intervals during the day because of the limitations of service during offpeak hours noncommuting trips may be more difficult to complete using transit in tualatin community feedback indicated the following specific needs for transit service connecting the west side of tualatin to the downtown core  parkandrides in the west and south areas of tualatin  extended service hours including weekend service  and more direct connections to places other than downtown portland e roadways some of the existing roadways do not meet city county or state design standards further a number of major roadways intersect with other roadways at a skew this creates sight distance limitations and thus safety concerns the two most highlytraveled roadways are sw tualatinsherwood road and sw nyberg road with over 20000 vehicles per day sw tualatin road and sw boones ferry road corridors have 10000 vehicles daily at multiple locations additionally sw tualatinsherwood road carries a large amount of heavy vehicles around 115 percent with sw boones ferry road carrying 84 percent heavy vehicles compared with the average road in the portland metro area which typically carries 24 percent heavy vehicles appendix b of the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 provides a full description of existing 2011 roadway conditions while appendix c provides a description of future 2035 forecasted roadway conditions in the existing conditions analysis only two intersectionssw martinazzi avenue and sw sagert street as well as sw teton avenue and sw tualatin road were found to have greater congestion than mobility standards allow in the future 2035 the number of intersections not meeting operations standards grew to twelve key needs identified for the street system include improved roadway connectivity  improved travel time along congested corridors  intersection improvements  and upgrading roadway geometries additionally safety is a concern for the community and safety issues were identified at the following intersections sw tualatinsherwood road and sw boones ferry road and sw nyberg street and i5 southbound off ramps f freight routes the needs of the freight system are consistent with those identified in the street system plan projects that address needs related to truck routes either directly or by providing alternate routes that improve traffic operations along truck routes serve the needs of the freight system g rail portland and western railroad pnwr owns and operates two freight rail lines within the city one track running northsouth accommodates both freight and the wes commuter rail and an eastwest line runs along the south side of sw herman road as of november 2012 the eastwest line carries one train daily in each direction and the north south has two freight trains daily in addition to the wes trains pnwr has no current plans to increase freight service although the eastwest track runs adjacent to manufacturing areas no rail sidings or other access to businesses are planned h pipelines and transmission systems a natural gas transmission pipeline and a gasoline pipeline cross city there is no anticipated need to increase pipeline capacity or construct new pipelines city and therefore no such improvements are proposed in the tsp i air there are no airports within the city of tualatin although several airports are located within 30 miles of the city the aurora state airport hillsboro municipal airport and portland international airport these airports meet the commercial freight and business aviation needs of tualatin residents no plans are proposed to construct airport facilities within the city of tualatin  existing airports are anticipated to continue serving the citizens of tualatin adequately j water the tualatin river is the only large waterway within the city of tualatin the river is used primarily for recreation and is open for canoeing and kayaking therefore the tsp does not include any specific policies programs or projects for the tualatin river as part of the transportation network however several projects are proposed in other sections of the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 to increase access to the river for recreation purposes 2 sewer service areas to assist in determining areas most suited to urban development a sewer service area overlay was prepared to illustrate the feasibility of providing sewer service throughout the tualatin planning area the study area was divided into four categories of sewer service availability in order of increasing complexity and expense of service in addition properties that can be served by existing pumping stations are considered to have gravityflow service available 3 water service areas as in the case of sewer service the tualatin study area was divided into four categories of water service availability the four categories agreed closely with the four categories of sewer service in addition to showing the degree of water service complexity and expense the water service overlay depicts main transmission lines reservoirs water supply sources and the approximate dividing line between the citys upper and lower water service levels 4 storm drainage the tualatin drainage plan defines and describes areas of inadequate drainage throughout the tualatin study area the plan which was originally prepared in 197 will need to be updated as part of the citys planning revision work but the overall drainage patterns have not changed the citys core area and the area along boones ferry road south of the core area are the most critical from the standpoint of drainage the former will be dealt with in conjunction with urban renewal area improvements 5 electrical service the study area is well served with major portland general electric co pge transmission lines line extensions to newly developing areas do not appear to be a problem 6 gas service the tualatin area is well served by several largecapacity natural gas lines the northwest natural gas co has main trunk lines in the bonneville power administration bpa rightofway west of the study area the city presently has a high percentage of natural gas use which should be reviewed in light of probable future supply and cost 7 telephone service the tigardtualatin area telephone system is presently overloading causing delays in calling and some dissatisfaction among residents and businesses the area is served by the general telephone co a new central office is in operation in the wilsonville area reducing the overloading of the 638exchanges because of recent and expected future growth in tualatin general telephone co is proposing the development of a new central office in tualatin or the expansion of their stafford office to handle the load 8 schools at this time the existing tualatin elementary school is overcrowded a new school in south tualatin is planned to be completed for fall of 1979 this according to the school district will relieve the overcrowding there are no sites now for a third school although the existing comprehensive plan indicates several potential locations there are three general areas developing for residential use in the city the southern part of the city will be served by the new school opening in 197 as well as the existing school which also serves the central area of the city the two other areas are east of the freeway and west of the tualatin country club these should be the areas for future sites depending upon projected population from future residential development high school students in tualatin are currently served by tigard high school according to the school district a major high school in tualatin is still many years away but preliminary thinking for a site has begun one small portion of the study area in the far southwest corner of the city is served by the sherwood school district a revision of boundaries may be necessary in this portion of the study area to conform the tigard school district boundaries to those of the city 9 parks a developed the only developed city park within the corporate city limits is the 23acre tualatin community park and a new 648acre nature park the community park provides for a broad range of activities for all ages and includes the tualatin community center both parks are in the process of being improved b undeveloped there are eight existing city park sites which are currently being developed c future conceived as recreational possibilities for neighborhood and broader community use 14 sites were inventoried these sites are scattered throughout the urbanized areas of the city each site is unique in its own fashion ie setting topography views vegetation access or natural wildlife resources 10 conservation management areas these areas comprise some of the citys richest natural and scenic assets and should be maintained in their present rural character briefly these areas are a the wetland marsh bog and ponds b all the flood plain area generally below the 100year flood line c all creek and drainageways d the tualatin riverbank areas 11 bikepaths and footpaths a an existing bike and footpath system has been implemented in some sections of the city b future extensions of the existing bike and footpath systems were proposed to provide the city with a complete network of trails this system was mapped in overlay fashion as part of the technical memoranda 12 school recreational facilities a these are areas suitable for play areas for small children and some field activities for older children and adults these sites would have to be developed via a joint use agreement between the city and the tigard school district b existing tualatin elementary school c future new elementary school in south tualatin and any additional elementary school sites 13 other recreational facilities a private the tualatin country club golf course provides a major private recreational facility in the city b public the city of tigard maintains cook park across the tualatin river which is available to residents of tualatin but has no direct access from tualatin the tigard school district maintains a swim center at tigard high school that is available for use by tualatin residents 14 views a unlike the more distinctly contoured geographic sections of other parts of the urban area tualatin does not have spectacular views views of scenic areas in tualatin are very subtle b features the most important views are of the drainages bogs and wetlands  the tualatin river  and outstanding groups of trees c location the most important view areas are the marsh and wetlands running in an eastwesterly direction in the southern portion of the city there are occasional views vegetation to mt hood mt scott kerr mountain bull mountain and cooper mountain particularly important views of mt hood occur when looking easterly along nyberg sagert and avery streets    chapter 4  community growth tdc   background 1 it is the purpose of this chapter to portray the reasons for tualatins rapid economic growth  to generally define the need and proportion of specific types of land use  to define public service and natural environmental constraints to development  to describe specific growth assumptions and objectives  and to define a specific growth boundary for the city overall this chapter provides a guide to how much land the city needs in what proportion where why and how fast 2 the process used to answer these questions revolves around the data developed in the technical memoranda the available market data was analyzed to determine how much land for each use would be required by the year 2000 and this demand balanced against specific assumptions of land use density and proportion at the same time this demand was compared to natural development constraints such as agricultural soil suitability flood plains and weak foundation soils and to public service constraints such as the ease of serving particular parcels of land with water sewer and road services also reviewed was the distribution and relationship of specific land uses to the growth assumptions and objectives described in this chapter and tdc chapters 5 6 7 and 8 the analysis and balancing of all these factors after review and revision by the citizen advisory committees resulted in the plan map contained in tdc tdc   the demand for land 1 population movement to the suburbs was very strong during the 1960s and early 1970s especially in the tualatin area during the period between 1960 to 197 the average annual growth rate here was 502 percent compared to 76 percent in the surrounding areas tualatins rapid growth is attributable to several major factors a moratoriums and restrictive growth policies in surrounding larger jurisdictions  b availability of land for development in a rural area at less than normal market rates  c a buildup of industry and a need for housing  and d a municipal attitude supporting development though land prices are now reaching market level the other factors are still very much in effect in addition new industries the popularity of westside living availability of large parcels of land and other factors further reinforce the desirability of tualatin for development this resulting great demand for new residential commercial and industrial land is causing a rapid transition from rural to urban land uses in tualatin today 2 specific information regarding projected community growth was developed in the technical memoranda the memoranda made two population projections one based on market growth and another based on an adopted growth policy the projections show the citys expected population growth under the two assumptions to the year 2000 and are shown on table 41 and figure 41 the first assumption uses a growth policy of 78 percent population growth annually while the second assumption uses the economic land market to determine the expected growth within the tualatin area 3 it should be noted that the citys growth will exceed the market growth predicted for 1980 based on the citys current rate of residential building permits issued the citys december 1978 population is estimated to be 6000 people it should also be noted that interest groups such as the oregon homebuilders association and the 1000 friends of oregon may oppose any type of growth restrictions on the basis of the effect of those restrictions on housing costs the land conservation and development commission has also expressed extreme interest in any move by the city toward adoption of growth controls 4 tualatin washington county and regional population growth relates directly to the demand for residential commercial and industrial land within the citys planning area residential land demand in average terms is dependent on assumed housing densities as well as population growth housing densities are discussed in tdc commercial and industrial land needs are less dependent on density assumptions and were estimated in the technical memoranda as follows a demand for commercial land growth policy172 acres in year 2000 market growth304 acres in year 2000 b demand for industrial land 9 to 11 acres per year 210 to 250 total acres in year 2000 c if the demand for the three major land use types is compared to the existing land available see table 33 it becomes apparent that there is sufficient land for commercial and industrial uses but insufficient land for residential uses within the city limits table 41 projected growth assumptions

buildable landsdevelopment constraints 1 this section describes those areas of the planning area vacant and available for new development that are easily served by public services and are not adversely affected by natural hazards this information is depicted on the buildable landsdevelopment constraints map which summarizes the following overlays that were developed for the phase itechnical memoranda buildable land inventory a slopes analysis  b water areas and wetlands  c existing land use  d water service areas  e sewer service areas  table 42 of this plan describes the actual acreage figures derived from the buildable land inventory 2 one development constraint not easily portrayed graphically is traffic congestion the tualatin area will likely be dependent upon the automobile as its major form of transportation in the year 2000 a traffic analysis of various growth alternatives was conducted as a part of the planning process and the analysis indicated that the city could not accommodate all the traffic generated by full development of the planning area particularly in the nyberg street corridor connecting to the interstate freeways table 42 buildable land

composition of a planning map certain assumptions must be made based on available data the following are the general growth assumptions used to develop this plan based on the data generated in the phase itechnical memoranda 1 the approximate proportion of residential land to commercial and industrial land should be 60 percent residential and 40 percent commercial and industrial 2 a portion of buildable land within the city will be unavailable for development ie not available for sale in 198 25 percent of the land will not be available for development because of owners holdings but this is estimated to decrease to ten percent by the year 2000 3 a portion of the planning area will not be available for development because of natural hazards such as flooding and the need to preserve natural areas such as wetlands river and streambanks 4 a portion of the planning area will not be available for development because of the need to provide corridors for roads and utilities 5 traffic congestion and the ease of providing water and sewer services will constrain the amount and direction of growth within the planning area 6 there is a need for land in the planning area to provide for a population in the year 2000 of between 22000 and 29000 people depending on the adoption of a controlled growth program and future density assumptions made in subsequent plan revisions adoption of a controlled growth program will be difficult to achieve because of interest groups and state agency opposition 7 there will be a solution to tualatins flood problem that will create additional buildable land at an indefinite time before the year 2000 8 existing land use will necessarily be a strong locational influence on the land use map to avoid future land use conflicts 9 there is no need to expand the citys area to provide additional land for new commercial and industrial development 10 the amount and location of additional residential development will be based on the objectives and density assumptions described by tdc tdc   general growth objectives the following are general objectives used as a guide to formulate the plan the objectives are positive statements to describe the plans intent to 1 provide a plan that will accommodate a population range of 22000 to 29000 people 2 cooperate with the metropolitan service district to reach regional consensus on population

growth boundary is necessary to predict the amount and location of urban land needed in the future the establishment of this boundary provides a framework for the orderly conversion of rural land to urban uses the growth boundary establishes the citys intent to annex and provide urban services to specific properties over a specific period of time thus the growth boundary establishes the basis of a city annexation policy and provides landowners with some assurance as to the citys intent for the future uses of their land 2 this boundary was first established cooperative intergovernmental process established by the columbia region association of governments in 1976 the boundary is a line establishing the limits of urban and agricultural use within the metropolitan portland area 3 the urban growth boundary is defined by applying the following criteria to the data developed by the phase itechnical memoranda a land needed to accommodate urban growth to the year 2000 using the assumption of this plan i urban land needs criteria b agricultural land as defined by statewide goal 3 must conform to one of the following categories i land developed for nonagricultural purposes ii land irrevocably committed to nonfarm use iii land justified under exception procedures of statewide goal 2 c urban growth boundary feature determinants are as follows and shall be used whenever possible i creeks with narrow flood plains due to their barrier effect and definability ii the edge of a wide flood plain due to its limiting effect on urban land use this criterion may be unsuitable if the flood plain is in agricultural use iii railroad tracks due to their barrier effect especially where road or highway crossings are involved iv power lines or easements due to their definability v roads due to their definability and barrier effect but unsuitable with respect to service provision vi rear property lines due to their definability and service provision tdc   requirements 1 metro growth management functional plan mugmfp tdc requires the city to adopt comprehensive plan provisions and land use regulations for areas added to the urban growth boundary ugb that are identified as

metro expanded the ubg to include 382 acres of land in the southwestern corner of tualatin of this area 302 acres were designated as regionally significant industrial area rsia and the remaining acreage was designated as industrial specific conditions were placed by metro relating to compliance with mugmfp titles 3 4 & 11 lot sizes and commercial restrictions the southwest tualatin concept

2010 urban reserve process as the knife river area and 66 acres south of tonquin road east of the railroad brought into the ugb in 2004 3 in march 201 plan amendments implementing the swcp for the 431 acre southwest and regionally significant industrial area portion of the swcp area were approved by the city council the amendments were not applied to the 1175 acre urban reserve designated by metro and the 655 acre basalt creek area to be considered in the basalt creek concept plan 4 in april 201 plan amendments implementing the basalt creek concept plan were adopted by the city council the concept plan included a 330acre buildable area south of tualatin the entire concept plan is 330 buildable acres 19423 buildable acres of which are within the tualatin ugb  42219 tdc   urban reserve plans 1 the metropolitan service district metro the urban reserve plans for urban reserve areas to be adopted as a component of the comprehensive plan of the city to which the urban reserve area will

and dated  is incorporated as a separate document into the tualatin development the urban reserve plan was developed in 1998 to meet the metro for urban reserve plans and it was known the property was considered a site for residential development the specific type of development was not known development of the property need not be in conformance with the urban reserve plan the property can be used for any of the permitted outright or conditional uses allowed in the planning district applied to it once annexed to the city of tualatin development of the property shall be in conformance with the applicable city standards and other applicable standards for the type of development proposed  chapter 5  residential planning growth tdc   background 1 the most controversial issue discussed during the preparation of the plan was housing particularly the issues of housing type and density over the last two years the community has seen extremely rapid apartment growth in the city that has created considerable negative feelings toward additional apartment development these feelings are related to the communitys concern about the esthetic quality of existing apartment development  concern about a large transient population within the city  concern about the effect of apartments on traffic congestion  and a concern about the effect apartment development has on singlefamily neighborhoods and the general livability of the city 2 community feelings have coalesced into an increasing demand for fewer multifamily housing units and even demand for a moratorium on additional apartment development at the same time community concern has increased over the amount and type of apartment construction interest groups such as the 1000 friends of oregon have shown concern for any action that would narrow the housing opportunities available to the regions residents statewide planning goal 10 the housing goal states that plans shall encourage the availability of adequate numbers of housing units at price ranges and rent levels which are commensurate with the financial capabilities of oregon households and allow for flexibility of housing location type and density 3 a to meet the communitys concern for the increasing amount of multifamily housing and to meet the state housing goal the plan proposes five residential land use categories one singlefamily and four multifamily for background the following figures show singlefamily to multifamily proportions in the region as well as the city of tualatin singlefamily % of dwelling units multifamily % of dwelling units portland

metropolitan service district b it is clearly shown in the above numbers that the city is more than accommodating the regions share of multifamily housing the longterm objective of the plan is to produce housing units that meet the regional projections as well as the communitys desire for multifamily units that minimize any adverse impacts within the citys singlefamily neighborhoods this has been accomplished by reviewing various housing density alternatives and other technical data that are defined in the phase itechnical memoranda this analysis indicated that the amount of land available for multifamily housing is nearing depletion and the present amount of land planned and zoned for this type of housing is minimal compared to demand as evidenced by the regional figures there will be an increasing need for multifamily residential units because of the national trend toward smaller families more singleparent families and the sharply rising costs of new singlefamily residential construction 4 to accommodate this need for additional multifamily land the plan proposes four mediumtohigh density housing categories as follows plan density rmlresidential mediumlow density 610 dwelling units per acre rmhresidential mediumhigh density 1115 dwelling units per acre rhresidential high density 1625 dwelling units per acre rhhrresidential high densityhigh rise 2630 dwelling units per acre 5 the multifamily areas described on the plan map referred to in tdc indicate that wherever possible multifamily areas were located close to the citys commercial core area where supporting commercial and transportation services are readily available the multifamily areas are also located close to the citys arterial and collector street system and have good access to the citys park and open space system 6 for an overall perspective on housing density please refer to tables 51 52 53 54 55 56 and 57 which summarize the acreage requirements dwelling unit proportions and population as shown on the plan map for each residential plan designation the figures in these tables were derived from the variables of housing density vacancy rates buildable land land not available for sale and the need for road and utility corridors 7 as evidenced by these figures the city in the year 2000 will be predominantly a city of lowdensity residential development lowdensity residential development will comprise 68 percent of the citys dwelling units and 79 percent of its population multifamily development in the year 2000 will comprise 32 percent of the citys dwelling units and 21 percent of its population  51192 table 51 buildable residential land within city limits 1977 use gross buildable acres percent market factor 25 25% net available acres rounded rl 3699 70% 2774 277 rml

the housing needs of existing and future city residents 2 provide housing opportunities for residents with varied income levels and tastes that are esthetically and functionally compatible with the existing community housing stock 3 cooperate with the housing authority of washington county and the housing division of clackamas county to identify sites projects and developers to provide the citys fair share of assisted housing units for low and moderate income households and participate in the regions housing opportunity plan 4 locate higher density development where it is convenient to the citys commercial core near schools and transit corridors adjacent to arterial and collector streets and as much as possible in areas with existing multifamily housing and provide residential opportunities in selected commercial areas mixed use commercial district 5 provide areas that are suitable for manufactured dwelling parks and areas that are suitable for subdivisions that will accommodate manufactured homes 6 provide areas that will accommodate small lot subdivisions 7 develop specific and enforceable design standards for multifamily developments townhouses manufactured

chapter 6  commercial planning districts tdc   background 1 commercial development in tualatin has occurred primarily in the downtown area and near the citys two interstate 5 freeway interchanges at lower boones ferry road and nyberg street downtown development consists mostly of retail service and office uses ranging in size from small locally owned firms to large national chain stores such as kmart development near the interchanges is predominantly automobileoriented and includes motels automobile service stations and restaurants 2 at present there are approximately 165 acres of land zoned for commercial use but only a little over  of this land is developed two factors account for the bulk of the undeveloped commercial land first much of this land is in large parcels ten or more acres owned by a few major developers such as schnitzer investment corporation these firms have held their land in anticipation of economic conditions favorable to largescale commercial development second much of the undeveloped commercial land is in the 100year flood plain of the tualatin river and is thus subject to additional development costs necessary to comply with applicable flood plain regulations 3 despite the large amount of undeveloped commercial land a number of factors suggest that this land will be needed for commercial use during the planning period first the demand for additional goods and services will increase as tualatins population increases greater concentrations of population and the relatively high incomes of the areas residents will support increasingly specialized types of retail and service establishments it should be noted that the adjoining communities of durham rivergrove and lake grove are predominantly residential in character with relatively little commercial development consequently growth of these cities will increase the demand for available commercial land in tualatin particularly near the lower boones ferry road interchange with i5 second the lower boones ferry road interchange area is subject to continued development pressure because of its accessibility for freeway travelers looking for gasoline food or lodging on their way to and from portland and finally the city is located adjacent to three of the regions major transportation routes the interstate 5 and 205 freeways and the state highway 217 expressway this access to the remainder of the region and to the willamette valley provides an opportunity for largerscale commercial and freewayoriented developments 4 it should be noted that while most of tualatins residents work elsewhere they will more likely work in the city if diversified job opportunities are available tualatins supply of commercial land will thus eventually create additional diverse job opportunities and hopefully decrease tualatin residents needs to travel out of the community to find jobs 5 as mentioned above the area north of the tualatin river around the lower boones ferry road interchange is attractive for freewayoriented commercial development the present comprehensive plan designates most of the area as general commercial and considerable development has occurred in the area since 1970 however a number of industrial firms are located throughout the area as a result of zoning established prior to the adoption of the existing comprehensive plan creating land use conflicts between existing and potential commercial development this plan expands commercial use in two areas and preserves for light industrial use those areas that are already committed to industrial development this was done because it was felt that the city had sufficient industrial land in the western industrial district and that proximity to the freeway interchange and the residential character of the area better lent itself to commercial use than industrial use 6 as much of the citys commercial land area is visible from the interstate 5 freeway and because all residents of tualatin must pass commercial area before reaching their homes it is important that esthetic design in commercial areas be sensitively handled generally the design of a communitys commercial area defines much of the communitys character fortunately the city has an architectural review process and an urban renewal agency to help prevent inappropriate unattractive development but much more could be done to increase the quality of architectural and landscape design in commercial areas because much of tualatins commercial land is forested is visible from the freeway or is adjacent to residential uses landextensive commercial uses such as automobile truck and machinery sales and rental would be more appropriately located in the citys western industrial district where there are relatively large flat and unforested parcels of land this area will have good access to freeways and landextensive commercial uses would not affect the industrial uses planned for this area 7 the roamers rest commercial area is unique in its character and history it has served the needs of the traveling and recreating public for many years and forms a part of the history of the portland metropolitan area it is appropriate to continue the general land use pattern of highway and recreation oriented commercial activity in this area even including the provision of housing in a mixeduse type of development a specialized planning district is necessary to accommodate the desired commercial activity without allowing other uses that are not oriented either to the river or the highway 8 as tualatin grows in terms of residents and employees and as these individuals disperse more throughout the city rather than concentrating near the downtown area there is an everincreasing demand for commercial services in close proximity to the people this demand is primarily for daytoday shopping and service needs such as small grocery purchases hair cutting and styling etc the creation of neighborhood commercial centers use of the new neighborhood commercial cn planning district will not only provide these services to the residents and employees it will work to reduce traffic by eliminating trips to the downtown commercial areas this concept is not seen as having any negative impact on the downtown area as the types of goods and services to be provided are small and limited in nature it is critical however that the design of neighborhood commercial uses be such that they are of a residential character and enhance rather than detract from neighborhoods 9 the provision of medical services to health care customers has changed rapidly since 1970 new equipment and procedures are now used as a result of fastdeveloping medical technology more services and new community outreach activities are provided to customers the doctorhospital concept has evolved into a healthcareprovidermedical center system standalone hospitals cannot now provide the facilities and services expected and needed by health care customers in their place are multiuse medical centers providing a full range of medical facilities and health care services the meridian park medical facility at sw 65th avenue and sw borland road is an example of the conversion from individual hospital to full service medical center in addition to the traditional hospital facilities community outreach programs such as personal counseling weight control post operative rehabilitation and substance abuse counseling are provided doctors now prefer their offices adjacent to the hospital building rather than in a distant office district or in a downtown location as in the past a medical center should be located in a medical center planning district medical centers are major employment centers which provide a stable employment base that is not as vulnerable to economic swings as most commercial and industrial employment centers meridian park hospital is a major employment center in tualatin it serves the citys residents as well as thousands of people in the south metropolitan portland area and beyond the city of tualatin has but one medical center providing a large number of medical facilities and health care services it will expand in the future a medical center district is provided to ensure that todays medical services and tomorrows new medical technology will be available to the residents of tualatin and the surrounding area      tdc   assumptions the following are general assumptions used to formulate this plan 1 demand for the citys commercial land will increase 2 largescale commercial enterprises will find tualatin an increasingly attractive location 3 the city will become a commercial center serving a population much larger than its own 4 retail commercial enterprises will locate primarily in the citys downtown area 5 freeway service establishments and offices will locate adjacent to the citys freeway interchanges or will be visible from the interstate 5 freeway 6 demand for hospitalrelated commercial development will occur near meridian park hospital 7 the creation of residential and employment concentrations away from the downtown core will create the need for neighborhood commercial centers these centers are intended to provide for daytoday shopping and service needs and are not intended to be serious competition with businesses in the downtown area  61383 tdc   objectives the following are general objectives used to guide the development of this plan 1 encourage commercial development 2 provide increased employment opportunities 3 provide shopping opportunities for surrounding communities 4 locate and design commercial areas to minimize traffic congestion and maximize access 5 continue to utilize specific and enforceable architectural and landscape design standards for commercial development 6 encourage developers to consider solar access when designing commercial development projects 7 provide for limited and carefully designed neighborhood commercial centers 8 provide for the continued development of major medical services facilities in the city of tualatin especially at the meridian park hospital site the medical center planning district shall be applied only to a property or a group of contiguous properties of no less than 25 acres and shall have frontage on an arterial as designated in tdc tualatin community plan            3 62220 tdc   commercial planning district objectives this section describes the purpose of each commercial planning district 1 office commercial planning district co to provide areas suitable for professional office uses adjacent to or across from residential areas restaurants may be allowed by conditional use permit when designed as an integral part of a major office complex it is the intent of this district to provide for office development ranging in size from small buildings with one or two tenants to large complexes housing business headquarters offices in the design of development in this district care shall be taken to preserve significant natural resources and to provide extensive perimeter landscaping especially adjacent to residential areas and streets 2 neighborhood commercial planning district cn to provide locations for commercial uses within close proximity to residential areas it is to provide for opportunities to serve the needs of residents for convenience shopping and services such uses will be limited to professional offices services and retail trade that are oriented to the daytoday commercial needs of the residential neighborhood neighborhood commercial uses are intended to be pedestrian oriented and should serve to reduce automobile trips and energy consumption the purpose is also to assure that such development is of a scale and design so that it is compatible with the residential environment and is an enhancement to neighborhood areas it is not the purpose of this district to create large scale commercial facilities that will compete with similar uses such as large grocery or department stores located in the downtown area 3 recreational commercial planning district cr to recognize the unique and valuable physical scenic cultural and historic character of the roamers rest area located between the tualatin river and pacific highway 99w north of the highways intersection with tualatin road it is intended to preserve that area by allowing and encouraging commercial and related uses that are oriented to the traveler on the highway or that are oriented toward and relate well with the river 4 central commercial planning district cc to provide areas for a full range of retail professional and service uses of the kinds usually found in downtown areas patronized by pedestrians civic social and cultural functions that serve the general community are also appropriate the central commercial planning district is almost entirely within the downtown portion of the urban renewal area the urban renewal plan contains extensive development policies and design standards that apply to this district these policies and standards are intended to help create a village atmosphere in the downtown area multiplefamily housing is appropriate in certain areas of this district as specified in the urban renewal plan 5 general commercial planning district cg to provide areas suitable for a full range of commercial uses including those uses that are inappropriate for neighborhood office or central commercial areas this district is particularly suitable for automobileserviceoriented businesses excluding automobile truck and machinery sales and rental located along the freeway and major arterials because of their location these uses are highly visible to large numbers of passing motorists commercial development along the freeway provides perhaps the only lasting impression of tualatin for many travelers therefore careful attention shall be given to site and structure design for development in this district including signs choice of materials and landscaping particularly in and around parking areas 6 mixeduse commercial planning district muc to provide areas suitable for a mix of office retail commercial and highdensity housing development standards in this district shall encourage a range of complementary and integrated uses oriented toward pedestrian activity 7 mid risecommercial office planning district comr to provide areas suitable for professional class a mid rise offices the comr district shall be applied to appropriate lands west of interstate 5 and south of the tualatin river since the potential application of this district extends over most of the citys incorporated area considerations such as proximity to established residential districts and preservation of significant views and visual corridors shall be encouraged 8 medical center planning district mc to provide areas for major medical centers providing medical facilities and health care services for the residents of tualatin and the surrounding area and to provide limited supporting retail and service uses for the convenience of patients patient visitors and staff the medical center district shall be no less than 25 acres and front on an arterial as designated in tdc tualatin community plan              4 62220 chapter 7  manufacturing planning districts tdc   background 1 tualatins relationship to road and rail access has provided a favorable environment for industrial development the citys industrial area is bisected by two railroads the burlington northern and the southern pacific and is served by the interstate 5 freeway which in turn provides access to the interstate 205 freeway and the state highway 217 expressway these transportation facilities provide good multimode access to the whole of the portland metropolitan area the willamette valley and to national markets because the area has good access to the transportation system large areas of land have been zoned for industrial use both in the city and west of the city in washington county 2 most of the existing industrial land use in the tualatin area is located between or adjacent to the burlington northern and southern pacific rail lines smaller pockets of industrial land occur immediately north of downtown tualatin and in the vicinity of the lower boones ferry roadinterstate 5 freeway interchange the amount of land zoned for industrial use is substantial the amount actually used is small data developed in the phase itechnical memoranda together with supplementary information developed by the citys economic consultants indicate that the portland region annually absorbs 240 acres and tualatin can be expected to utilize nine to 15 acres of industrial land per year there are 1975 acres of industrially zoned land within the tualatin study area and 304 acres are currently being used the city contains 650 acres of industrially zoned land with 577 of those acres now vacant while some of tualatins industrially zoned land is poorly drained or has weak foundation soils the majority of the industrially zoned land is either buildable or can be made buildable subtracting existing industrial uses and the worstdrained areas the city has approximately 450 acres of vacant industrial land within its city limits while this industrial land supply exceeds that needed to meet the citys needs for the year 200 few land parcels that were originally planned for industrial use were converted to other uses in the plan this was because industries that owned the land were committed to future development of their particular sites and because most of the area is impacted by existing scattered industrial development additionally the city wishes to maximize industrial development within the city to produce revenue for public amenities in the city a surplus of additional industrial land will help to maintain tualatins competitiveness in the industrial land market 3 the existing scattered distribution of industrial uses is a problem because it restricts choice of land use alternatives and makes it expensive to provide appropriate urban services such as public water and sewer service and fire protection consequently this plan emphasizes the shortterm concentration of industrial development within the city limits 4 industrial development in washington county will affect tualatins industrial future this area west of the city now contains scattered industrial development without public water or sewer services and minimum fire protection while current county zoning allows only uses that have a minimum capital equipment investment and are not laborintensive the amount of industrially zoned land exceeds 1000 acres and the aggregate effect on traffic could impact the development of industrial land within the city this is because most traffic traveling to and from this outlying industrial area must pass citys nyberg streettualatinsherwood road corridor to reach the regions freeway system as stated in the transportation plan additional transportation access must be developed to minimize the effect of industrial development west of tualatin the proposed i5norwood road interchange would help to alleviate a portion of this problem additionally it is anticipated that because land values for land without standard urban public services are approximately  those values inside the city there will be pressure to develop inexpensive county land before land in the city more industrial growth west of the city could eventually place the citys roadway system at capacity before it has developed its proportionate share of industrial land thus making it difficult to develop the remainder of the citys industrial land in other words the continued availability of inexpensive county industrial land could place city industrial land at a competitive disadvantage in the industrial land marketplace 5 despite the problems described above it is expected that lowerintensity industrial growth will continue to occur in washington county west of the city and that there will be increasing pressure to convert this land to full industrial development consequently this area is eventually expected to become a part of the city of tualatin if the problems of transportation access can be solved consequently it is an objective of this plan to study methods of eventually accommodating within the city the industrial growth that is expected to occur in this area 6 specific problems related to the development of land inside the city include poor drainage poor northsouth roadway access lack of sewer and water services and noise and other environmental problems the central portion of the industrial area between herman and tualatinsherwood roads is poorly drained and contains the hedges creek marsh the largest wetland area in washington county the plan proposes the preservation of a portion of this approximately 80acre natural area and anticipates the definition of an area surrounding the marsh in which industrial development would be allowed currently industrial traffic in tualatins central industrial area must travel long distances or on cipole road to travel from southern to northern industrial areas as many local industries utilize each others services it is inconvenient and uneconomic to continue this arrangement of roadways consequently the transportation plan proposes a new northsouth roadway central industrial area in the 102nd104th corridor lack of sewer services in the northwestern portion of the citys main industrial area also has been a handicap to industrial development two newly formed local improvement districts one for new roadway sewer and water improvements in the 102nd104th corridor and one for a major interceptor sewer paralleling tualatin and herman roads have been implemented to solve the major utility and traffic circulation problems in the industrial area industrial noise and odors have already begun to affect adjacent residential areas one of the objectives of this plan element and other elements is to develop specific and enforceable design standards that minimize future environmental conflicts between industrial commercial and residential land uses 7 one of the most efficient methods of minimizing industrial impacts on commercial and residential uses is to restrict the types and location of uses that are allowed in the citys industrial districts the types of industrial uses contemplated by the plan eliminate those uses which are considered most obnoxious such as creosote treatment of products manufacture of harmful chemicals forge plants and auto wrecking uses that are allowed will be in the mediumtolight intensity range although they will be specifically referred to as light and general for ease of understanding the light industrial uses are arranged in the plan to be adjacent to residential areas to minimize environmental conflicts as much as possible because industrial processes change rapidly due to new technology it is also intended that some industrial uses proposed in the general use category may be appropriate in a lighter use area if properly designed to mitigate adverse environmental impacts 8 while most of tualatins industrial land is located between tualatin road and avery street in the western portion of the city there are small amounts of industrial land located in the northern portion of the city and lying on either side of the lower boones ferry roadinterstate 5 freeway interchange the plan has maintained as industrial use those areas that are now committed to industrial development however some land previously zoned industrial has been converted to a commercial designation because of the residential character of the area and proximity to the freeway the industrial land in this area is designated on the plan as light industrial because of the areas proximity to commercial and residential areas 9 in december 2002 metro expanded the urban growth boundary adding land west of cipole road and south of the north rightofway line of sw pacific highway for industrial development to assist in meeting the overall regional need for a 20year supply of industrial land 10 in december 2002 and june 2004 metro expanded the urban growth boundary to include 382 acres of land south of sw tualatin sherwood road in the area east of a future 124th avenue 302 acres of this area were designated by metro as regionally significant industrial area rsia and the remaining acreage was designated industrial the area was addressed in the southwest tualatin concept plan and was accepted by the city in october 2010 11 in 200 metro expanded the urban growth boundary to include the basalt creek planning area the portion of this area within the city urban planning area is generally south of sw norwood road and sw helenius street east of 124th avenue west of i5 and north of basalt creek parkway this area was addressed in the basalt creek concept plan and was accepted by the city in august 2018   62705     42219 tdc   manufacturing planning area overview this section describes the history and nature of the manufacturing planning area 1 the industrial planning area is located in the southeastern portion of washington county and immediately west of the developed portion of the city of tualatin it is within the urban growth boundary and was annexed to tualatin in november 198 except for a few individual parcels 2 the industrial planning area is served by pacific highway highway 99w as a direct route to portland it also is tied directly by tualatinsherwood road and indirectly by tualatin road and herman road to interstate 5 with direct ties to the east via interstate 205 it is crossed by southern pacific and burlington northern railroad lines 3 the area lies in the relatively flat lowlands of the tualatin valley with farmland scattered throughout although the area is currently rural and suburban in nature increasing pressure for development is occurring this is noted by the construction of several new industrial uses within the planning area during the last ten years and the rapid growth of industrial use in the western portions of the city 4 the first settlement in the area was established in the mid1800s by the 1850s all the land along the tualatin river bank had been claimed and settlement began in earnest the technical memoranda of the tualatin development a more detailed history of the city and its surrounding area 5 the industrial planning area encompasses approximately 1096 acres coupled with the industrial land that was already in the western portion of the city the total western industrial district has 1775 acres of land 6 the tualatin area has experienced tremendous growth in the last decade population increased rapidly due to several factors including land availability and buildup of employment opportunities development 7 the economy of the planning area is tied directly to that of washington county and the portland metropolitan area at this time only 12 percent of tualatin residents work in the city while approximately 75 percent of the employees within the community live outside again the city has determined that it is a community goal to expand as a regional employment center increasing its percentage of total jobs in the region and at the same time providing additional residential and commercial opportunities so that more people can both live and work in tualatin   tdc   planning context this section describes the legal and political context for the planning work leading to the adoption of the industrial planning area plan amendment 1 introduction the preparation of the west tualatin industrial planning area plan amendment is not an isolated planning effort there are many other policies on the local regional and state level that provide the framework for this planning effort 2 local plans of primary importance is the citys comprehensive plan the tualatin community plan this plan amendment must be set in a direction that complies with and helps to implement the goals policies and objectives of that document since the plan was adopted on  the city has continued to experience a high rate of growth and has maintained an aggressive posture toward economic development the addition of these industrial lands to the city is a direct result of the goals and objectives of the plan this amendment is designed to continue the advances that the plan charted and the city has followed 3 regional plans a the industrial planning area and the entire city are part of the metropolitan service district metro a regional government with jurisdiction for the urban portion of the tricounty metropolitan area metro is authorized by state law ors 197 to 1 establish regional planning goals  2 develop various functional plans for the district concerning housing transportation solid waste drainage and other regionwide issues  and 3 ensure that member jurisdictions conform to any regional planning elements which have been adopted by the metro council b metro is responsible specifically for regional transportation planning and for defining and maintaining a regional urban growth boundary ugb the ugb essentially delineates urban lands from rural and natural resource lands designed to include those lands needed to accommodate growth to the year 200 the ugb must be respected and supported by metro counties and cities in order for their comprehensive plans to achieve compliance with lcdc goal 14urbanization the ugb forms the southwest boundary of the industrial planning area c another regional planning effort that helps define this plan amendment is the work of washington county embodied in the comprehensive framework plan this plan allocates the growth anticipated within the county to various geographic areas this growth in terms of both resident population and employment was assigned on the basis of land availability opportunities for economic development transportation and utility availability and other locational factors the city will use these allocations as one of the bases for developing this plan amendment d in order to require and maintain effective coordination between washington county and its various cities including tualatin urban planning area agreements upaas have been drawn up these identify areas of mutual planning interest and establish procedures allowing the cities and the county to exchange information and comments on development and to coordinate planning for development in these areas 4 statewide planning goals finally at the state level are the statewide planning goals and guidelines adopted by the land conservation and development commission lcdc the comprehensive plans of all cities and counties in the state must be directed towards meeting the goals this amendment will address each of these goals as appropriate however it is not organized goal by goal rather it follows the format of the existing community plan and will deal with each goal in that framework the goals include a citizen involvement  b land use planning  c agricultural lands  d forest lands  e open spaces scenic and historic areas and natural resources  f air land and water resources quality  g areas subject to natural disasters and hazards  h recreation  i economy of the state  j housing  k public facilities and services  l transportation  m energy conservation  n urbanization  tdc   planning concept for the manufacturing planning area this section describes the general intentions or concept for the manufacturing planning area plan 1 land use pattern a washington county has been working for many years in determining appropriate locations and configurations for various land uses throughout the county the basic concept decisions have involved the major delineation between rural and urban land uses and the appropriate locations for the various urban uses these concepts which are included in the comprehensive framework plan are based on professional analysis and input from a series of public hearings held in the fall of 1981 the conclusions for the basic concept all indicated that industrial development was and continues to be the most appropriate land use for the study area b with the annexation of the industrial planning area to the city of tualatin the responsibility for determining this planning concept has shifted from the county to the city however tualatin has determined that the countys basic analysis and conclusions are sound and will continue to support and plan for future industrial use in this area this is recognized as being totally in compliance with the citys goal of becoming a major employment center and forms a natural extension of the existing industrial areas bordering the western edge of the former city limits 2 housing and employment allocations a allocations of new housing units and employment opportunities in terms of residential commercial and industrial acreage have been made for each community planning area within the entire metro ugb by metro with the cooperation of each local government this distribution of potential growth is necessary to show how future growth can be made compatible with the development concept and consistent with state regional and local plans and regulations b these area allocations together reflect the total countys share of the regional growth estimated for the year 2000 and beyond for the existing unincorporated area of the county within the ugb ie all land inside the ugb but outside the city limits of all cities in the county approximately 90000 additional people 39500 new homes and 38800 new jobs are expected by the year 2000 this allocation applies to the incorporated study area as it was prepared prior to the annexation c the tualatin development population projections that formed a basis of that planning effort and are also used in this process those projections indicated that if market trends are followed the city of tualatin will have a population of 28721 by the year 200 or an increase of 22331 from the year 1980 this indicates that the city meaning all lands within the total planning area will absorb 248 percent of the growth that is projected for the unincorporated portions of the county within the ugb d the growth allocations are basically intended to be a planning tool that assures that the projected growth is accommodated in a manner that provides for adequate housing public facilities and services and employment opportunities spreading the need to absorb this growth fairly throughout the metropolitan area every jurisdiction has a legal responsibility to allocate enough land to meet the projected needs each community is to designate land in various use categories to accommodate the acreage totals assigned to it by metro for a variety of housing densities and employment opportunities e in order to help assure that the rapidly changing needs for housing options were being met the lcdc adopted an administrative rule setting certain standards for planning for new housing within the portland metropolitan area known as the metro housing rule the city must provide the opportunity for a new residential construction mix of 50 percent detached units to 50 percent attached units in addition the housing rule established an average residential density target for new construction of at least eight units per net buildable acre f the county draft of the plan for the study area included an allocation of 8372 new employees this is distributed mostly at a density of five employees per acre the city finds that this density projection is extremely low based on the current pattern in the area which is approximately 15 employees per acre with the acreage available the transportation and utility facilities available and the very supportive attitude of the city industrial land uses are anticipated that will generate three or more times the number of employees within the industrial planning area within the planning period g therefore the city recognizes the employment allocations of the county but finding them too small will not be bound by them in planning for the industrial area or in encouraging and fostering economic development    tdc   assumptions the following are general assumptions used to formulate the plan 1 the city can be expected to use a minimum of 25 acres of industrial land annually 2 traffic access and sewer and water service problems associated with the western industrial district will be remedied as the area is developed  tdc   objectives the following are general objectives used to guide development of the plan and that should guide implementation of the plans recommendations 1 encourage new industrial development 2 provide increased local employment opportunity moving from 12 percent local employment to 25 percent while at the same time making the city and in particular the western industrial district a major regional employment center 3 improve the financial capability of the city increase in the tax base and the use of creative financing tools 4 preserve and protect with limited exceptions the citys existing industrial land 5 cooperate with washington county metro and the state of oregon to study the methods available for providing transportation water and sewer services to the western industrial district 6 fully develop the western industrial district and the southwest tualatin concept plan area swcp providing full transportation sewer and water services prior to or as development occurs 7 improve traffic access to the western industrial district and swcp area from the interstate 5 freeway and state highway 99w improvements identified in the 2035 regional transportation plan 8 cooperate with the department of environmental quality and metro to meet applicable air quality standards by 1987 9 construct a northsouth major arterial street between tualatin road and tualatinsherwood road and sw tonquin road in the 124th avenue alignment to serve the industrial area 10 rebuild the tualatin roadpacific highway intersection to allow for substantially greater traffic flows 11 provide truck routes for industrial traffic that provide for efficient movement of goods while protecting the quality of residential areas 12 protect residential commercial and sensitive industrial uses from the adverse environmental impacts of industrial use 13 protect adjacent land uses from noise impacts by adopting industrial noise standards 14 continue to protect the hedges creek wetland and tonquin scablands from adverse impacts of adjacent development 15 continue to administer specific and enforceable architectural and landscape design standards for industrial development 16 encourage industrial firms to use cogeneration as a means to utilize waste heat from industrial processes and consider solar access when designing industrial facilities 17 protect wooded areas identified on the natural features map found in the technical memorandum by requiring their preservation in a natural state or by integrating the major trees into the design of the parking lots buildings or more formal landscaping areas of an industrial development if it is necessary to remove a portion or all of the trees the replacement landscape features shall be subject to approval architectural review process      tdc   manufacturing planning district objectives

district mbp a the purpose of the mbp planning district is to provide an environment for industrial development consistent with the southwest tualatin concept plan accepted by the city in october 2010 and as a metrodesignated regionally significant industrial area rsia consistent with metros urban growth boundary expansion decisions of 2002 and 2004 b the mbp planning district will be a mix of light industrial and hightech uses in a corporate campus setting consistent with mbp planning district development standards the rsiadesignated area requires at least one 100acre parcel and one 50acre parcel for large industrial users the remainder of the area is likely to include light industrial uses with some limited localserving commercial services c the district is intended to provide for an esthetically attractive working environment with campuslike grounds attractive buildings ample employee parking and other amenities appropriate to an employee oriented activity it also is intended to protect existing and future sites for such uses by maintaining large lot configurations a cohesive planneddevelopment design and limiting uses to those that are of a nature that will not conflict with other industrial uses or nearby residential areas of the city               62606   chapter 8  public semipublic and miscellaneous land use tdc   background 1 there are several land uses that do not neatly fit into the normal residential commercial or industrial land use categories these are uses such as government offices utility facilities schools churches and retirement homes tdc  to  define the objectives for these miscellaneous facilities 2 trends in land development particularly related to religious institutions schools and public parks have shifted over time away from development of relatively small structures and facilities located on relatively small lots which serve a single purpose towards large campusstyle developments consisting of multiple structures or facilities located on large parcels of land which often serve multiple purposes and provide multiple services religious institutions schools and parks are also increasingly exhibiting a trend towards constantly changing programs uses and facility improvements to reflect and respond to shifting demographic patterns and evolving needs of the community they serve the particular needs of and the citys assumptions and objectives for development of large campusstyle institutional uses which may not readily conform with development patterns and standards in normal residential commercial or industrial land use categories are set forth in tdc  and     tdc   general government services this category includes a variety of dissimilar uses from general offices to public works shops the objectives for the location of these uses are to 1 locate when possible general government offices in the urban renewal area preferably in a common building on the citys proposed civic center site 2 locate facilities such as the citys operations center in the citys western industrial area tdc   utility facility this category includes land uses such as public utility facilities eg water reservoirs water and sewerage pump stations pressure reading stations  electrical substations  telephone exchange or switching facilities  and natural gas pumping facilities owned operated and maintained either by a public agency or for profit entity these facilities generally cannot be placed in a single planning district but must be placed to best serve the utility system consequently these uses may be located in any planning district but must meet the following objectives 1 be designed attractively to blend with adjacent development particularly in residential areas 2 be located and designed if of a hazardous nature to protect adjacent development from potential harm or damage 3 subject aboveground utility facilities ie buildings tanks fencing screen walls and landscaping to review citys architectural review process  tdc   schools 1 this category includes land uses associated with services generally provided by the public school system although in some cases educational services may be provided by religious or business organizations the objectives for these facilities are to a cooperate with local school districts to plan for adequate educational services commensurate with the growth of the city b locate elementary school sites wherever possible adjacent to neighborhood park sites and integrate the location of such schools into the residential neighborhoods they are designated to serve c locate junior high or high school sites adjacent to arterial or collector streets d locate all schools providing primary and secondary education as far as possible from commercial and industrial districts unless the education provided would be vocational in nature e locate vocational schools in commercial or industrial districts commensurate with the type of education being provided f work collaboratively with the tigardtualatin school district the city of tigard washington county and other interested parties to address the requirements of senate bill 908 passed by the 1993 legislature oregon revised statutes  the city of tualatin shall work collaboratively to revise the tigardtualatin school districts school facility plan adopted  g the city shall enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the tigardtualatin school district to agree to the greatest extent possible on the criteria for the capacity of school facilities h the city accepts those school facility capacity criteria as set forth in the school facility plan as its own for purposes of evaluating applications for a comprehensive plan amendment or for a residential land use regulation amendment i the city shall provide notice to the tigardtualatin school district when considering a plan or land use regulation amendment that significantly impacts school capacity 2 it should be noted that a discussion of public schools in the tualatin area occurs within tdc 8 of this plan the general locations of neighborhood elementary schoolpark sites are indicated on the park greenways and bikeways map contained in tdc parks and recreation  tdc   churches retirement homes residential facilities and hospitals this range of land uses has varied locational requirements because of the frequency of use the nature of the use and other factors none of these uses should be located in an industrial planning district they should be located in commercial and residential districts with certain restrictions congregate care facilities assisted living facilities residential care facilities and hospitals should also be located in the medical center district because their locational possibilities and character are so varied they should be considered as conditional uses in all commercial and residential planning districts except where such a requirement would violate land use or other provisions of oregon state statutes or federal laws such as the fair housing amendments act of 198 should be located with good access to arterial or collector streets and should be close to the citys park areas churches or religious institutions should be considered as permitted uses in the institutional planning district congregate care facilities assisted living facilities and residential care facilities and hospitals should be considered as permitted uses in the medical center district consequently the objectives for these uses are to 1 prohibit uses such as residential facilities retirement homes and hospitals in industrial planning districts 2 allow uses such as churches retirement homes and hospitals in commercial and residential planning districts subject to conditional use approval and allow congregate care facilities assisted living facilities and residential care facilities and hospitals as permitted uses in the medical center district 3 allow residential facilities and residential homes as permitted uses in all residential planning districts and allow residential facilities as a conditional use in planning districts where multiple family development is a conditional use 4 locate uses such as churches retirement homes and hospitals that are in residential planning districts adjacent to arterial or collector streets and close to the citys park areas 5 cooperate with the appropriate federal state and regional agencies to assess health care services for the area 6 provide institutional planning district areas of the city that are of an appropriate size have access to a collector or arterial street and are served by adequate public facilities in order to accommodate churches or religious institutions as permitted uses      and 2 21097     tdc   solid waste disposal sites 1 solid waste disposal is a regional concern requiring regional solutions the city recognizes msds responsibility and authority to prepare and implement a solid waste management plan supports the msd procedures for siting sanitary landfills and will participate in these procedures as appropriate 2 the city contains one identified solid waste site north of bridgeport road this site is known as the durham pits site as identified in an msd report entitled disposal siting alternatives tdc   day care facilities because day care is needed both by residents and employees who commute into the city day care facilities should be located in areas convenient for commuters as well as residents including commercial residential and some industrial areas day care centers should be located with good access to arterial or collector streets and should be close to the citys park areas day care facilities should not be located close to automobile service stations or where they will be surrounded by industrial uses however industrial perimeter areas where they can easily serve both residents and employees of nearby firms are suitable the impact of a day care center on a residential neighborhood in terms of noise and traffic generation differs from that of residences and should be reviewed before it is permitted there consequently the objectives for day care centers are to 1 facilitate creation of adequate child care facilities within the community by limiting local requirements recognizing the role of the states childrens services division in certifying such facilities accordingly day care centers should be allowed as permitted uses in commercial and light industrial areas 2 encourage family day care providers to operate in residential and commercial areas by permitting them outright 3 protect residential areas from potential adverse impacts of day care centers conditional use process 4 locate day care centers adjacent to arterial or collector streets and close to the citys park areas 5 allow child day care centers as a conditional accessory use in the institutional planning district in order that residents utilizing the services of the school church or park in the institutional planning district may also have access to onsite day care services while still ensuring that any potential impacts are adequately mitigated conditional use process    tdc   wireless communication facilities this category includes land uses that transmit or receive radio frequency signals airwaves the objectives for these facilities are 1 to minimize the visual impacts associated with wireless communication facilities 2 to provide a wide range of locations for wireless communication facilities 3 to encourage creative approaches in locating wireless communication facilities that will blend with their surroundings 4 to coordinate the review of new wireless communication facilities with the federal communication commission federal aviation administration and oregon department of transportation aeronautics division 5 to comply with the requirements of the 1996 federal telecommunications act 6 to encourage colocation of wireless communication facilities to reduce the number of facilities in the community  tdc   institutional planning district assumptions the following are general assumptions used to formulate this plan 1 the city recognizes that religious institutions schools and public parks play an important role in the community by providing a multitude of services and hosting a wide variety of activities 2 religious institutions schools and public parks can have particular land development needs to accommodate largescale campusstyle improvements which may not readily conform with development patterns and standards in normal residential commercial or industrial land use categories 3 the citys population is projected to continue to grow demand for large campusstyle religious institutions schools and public parks designed to serve multiple purposes and provide multiple services to the community will increase as the citys population continues to increase 4 development of largescale campusstyle religious institutions schools and public parks in normal residential commercial or manufacturing planning districts results in consumption of large parcels of land in those planning districts and thereby precludes utilization of land in those districts for the primary purposes for which they are intended which is housing retail office and manufacturing uses creation of an institutional planning district helps to preserve land in residential commercial and manufacturing districts for the primary purposes for which those districts are intended  tdc   institutional planning district objectives this section describes the purpose of the institutional planning district and includes the objectives used to guide development of the planning district standards and to guide application of the planning district to particular areas of the city 1 the purpose of this district is to provide an environment exclusively for and conducive to the development and operation of religious institutions schools public parks and related uses in a manner that is harmonious with adjacent and nearby residential commercial or manufacturing planning districts and uses 2 the district is intended to accommodate largescale campusstyle developments owned and operated by governmental or nonprofit entities consisting of multiple structures or facilities which may serve multiple purposes and provide multiple services to the community 3 permitted and conditional uses shall be developed and operated in a manner that promotes and protects the health safety and general welfare of all adjacent and nearby planning districts and uses additionally conditional uses shall be allowed provided that the use is developed and operated in a manner that is consistent with the intent of the planning district and that promotes and protects the health safety and general welfare of all adjacent and nearby planning districts and uses 4 the district may be applied to land that is able to accommodate largescale campusstyle development and operation of religious institutions schools public parks and related uses as follows a contiguous land one and onehalf acre in size or greater  b access to a collector or arterial street  c adequate public facilities are available to the property  chapter 9  plan map tdc   background this plan section includes the plan map map 91 classification of planning district boundaries and brief descriptions of the land uses in each plan area the plan map is a synthesis of the objectives contained in each plan element that can be portrayed graphically in map form the map is based on an analysis of data contained in the phase itechnical memoranda northwest tualatin concept plan 2005 and an analysis of plan objectives and the statewide planning goals of the land conservation and development commission    tdc   planning district boundaries the boundaries between planning districts as portrayed on the plan map are intended to follow property lines or extensions thereof roadways or natural features such as creeks where such definition was not possible the map is drawn to scale and district boundaries can be determined by using this scale it should be noted that property lines shown on the plan map were derived from county assessors maps and are therefore relatively accurate consequently the planning districts shown on the plan shall be considered zoning districts as normally termed this eliminates the need for two sets of maps and simplifies the understanding of what land uses may be allowed on an individual property tdc   tualatin design type boundaries 1 map 94 tualatin design type boundaries shows the citys final location of the metropolitan service districts growth concept design types metro adopted the general location of the design types as part of adopting the urban growth management functional plan ugmfp metro  the ugmfp title 1 says for each of the following 2040 growth concept design types city and county comprehensive plans shall be amended to include the boundaries of each area determined by the city or county consistent with the general locations shown on the 2040 growth concept map  map 94 shows the location of the applicable design types consistent with the general locations shown on the 2040 growth concept map the boundaries are intended to follow the planning district boundaries property lines rightsofway centerlines and water features 2 rural reserves and green corridors the city recognizes that green corridors as described in the 2040 growth concept are critical to interurban connectivity if the city at some future date annexes an area that includes a green corridor it will be the citys policy to do the following a allow access in a controlled manner to the green corridor to maintain the function capacity and level of service of the transportation facility and to enhance safety and minimize development pressures on rural reserve areas  and b provide appropriate vegetative screening and buffering of adjacent development and limit signage in such a way as to maintain the rural character of the green corridor  tdc   area descriptions to clarify the plan map the map has been divided into 14 plan areas and the following describes in narrative form the permitted uses for each plan area all plan areas with the exception of those comprising commercial and industrial lands provide the framework for neighborhood organizations it was with this in mind that the plan areas were drawn each area with the exception stated above was viewed as a potential neighborhood unit having its own area of interest comprising a population of 3000 to 5000 persons and served as much as possible by common facilities such as schools or parks  tdc   area 1 this portion of the plan comprises the citys central area and is described in the citys adopted central urban renewal plan the central urban renewal plan is a separate plan but considered an element of this plan this plan has been drafted to minimize any land use conflicts between uses on the periphery of the central urban renewal area map 93 central tualatin urban renewal area planning districts shows the central urban renewal boundary the core area parking district boundary land use blocks within the central urban renewal area minimum lot sizes for blocks within the central urban renewal area and the designation of which blocks require a master plan to be submitted for development    tdc   area 2 located directly south of the urban renewal area and west of the interstate 5 freeway i5 this area comprises most of the citys residential land west of i5 and north of avery street being close to downtown the area has a higher proportion of multifamily dwellings than other areas with the northern and eastern portions of the area comprising mediumlow mediumhigh and high density multifamily residential development the southern portion of the area is predominantly low density residential the tualatin elementary school is located in the center of the area at the intersection of boones ferry road and sagert streets the northeasterly portion of the area includes largescale commercial uses that are included in the schnitzer investment corporation planned unit development pud the commercial uses in this section of the pud are proposed to include primarily headquarters office space for major firms and supporting commercial services such as restaurants the western side of this area is bordered by a light industrial plan designation while a portion of the areas northern boundary is bordered by the burlington northern railway tracks and mixed industrial and commercial designations tdc   area 3 this area is characterized by low density residential development the citys greenway loop system traverses the area a new neighborhood park is proposed for this area the areas northwestern corner is bordered by a light manufacturing planning district while the western and southwestern boundaries are bordered by land outside the urban growth boundary tdc   area 4 this area lies south of avery street between the interstate 5 freeway and boones ferry road the predominant land use is low density residential a new elementary school located east of boones ferry road between blake and ibach streets is currently being constructed and will serve students from the south tualatin area a large greenway loop passes area to connect with the remainder of the loop in area 3 the area is bordered on the east by the interstate 5 freeway and on the south by land outside the urban growth boundary tdc   area 5 located east of the interstate 5 freeway this area is primarily designated for low density residential uses but contains substantial multifamily and commercial use north of sagert street and west of sw 65th avenue meridian park hospital is located in this area on the northeast corner of sw 65th avenue and borland road commercial land uses are located along the interstate 5 freeway and on nyberg street from i5 to sw 65th avenue a major greenway loop surrounds a majority of the areas perimeter including a greenway shown along the tualatin river frontage a new neighborhood park is proposed the eastern and southern boundaries of this area are adjacent to land outside the urban growth boundary tdc   area 6 encompassing the northwestern quadrant of the city this areas land uses are predominantly low density residential an area designated mediumlow density residential paralleling sw 108th avenue is shown as appropriate for mobile residential unit parks a greenway extends along the tualatin river and a new neighborhood park is proposed lands north of hazelbrook road are within the 100year and 10year flood plain area and thus have restricted development potential tdc   area 7 this area comprises the majority of the citys industrial land the edges of this area are designated light industrial where the area abuts residential use the central portion of this area is designated heavy industrial and surrounds a portion of the hedges creek marsh which is proposed for preservation the eastern portion abuts the urban renewal area tdc   area 8 this area includes the portion of the city and study area located north of the tualatin river interstate 5 bisects the area and crosses sw lower boones ferry road at one of the citys two interchanges the area is characterized by mixed land uses with commercial and industrial uses being the predominant types of development automobileoriented uses such as motels restaurants and automobile service stations are concentrated adjacent to the interchange together with some commercial office buildings industrial uses are located further away from the interchange except for two mobile home parks a duplex subdivision pipers run and mixed residential uses in the mixed use commercial overlay district on the durham quarry site in the durham quarry area no new residential development is planned for area 8 the plan proposes additional general commercial and light manufacturing uses south of jean road and general commercial light manufacturing and heavy manufacturing uses north of jean road      tdc   area 9 leveton industrial area the leveton area is marked by a great diversity of land uses and opportunities much of the frontage along highway 99w has been developed for many years the largest single undeveloped parcel within the industrial planning area and at 217 acres one of the largest in the entire portland metropolitan region is here there is a great deal of vacant land available in a variety of acreage the area includes approximately 522 acres of land of which approximately 33 are developed in 2002 an additional 23 acres were added to the area a detailed discussion of the existing land uses and planning issues and considerations is given in the technical memorandum and northwest tualatin concept plan 2005 there are three subareas in this area each has a different character and is described separately below 1 the highway 99w frontagethis area is marked by industrial uses as listed in the planning district standards and includes the quarry sector subarea and northwest tualatin concept plan 2005 area it is important to recognize the character of these properties as industrial but to assure that the land use does not conflict with or discourage development on nearby properties the properties are designated general manufacturing mg and light manufacturing ml on the plan map the rightofway area of highway 99w west of cipole road is not developable and is designated as general manufacturing cg on the plan map 2 herman road frontagethis area is largely undeveloped with industrial activities the general manufacturing mg planning district is assigned here since this area is well separated from the residential areas the mg designation will give the area maximum flexibility for development 3 leveton propertythe leveton property presents unique planning opportunities that must be protected in order to assure the greatest benefit to the community from development of the property neither the ml nor the mg planning districts are appropriate for the property as they include uses that are not compatible with a campus industrial setting also the ml and mg districts have development standards that neither encourage nor mandate the campus environment it is clear that a special district needs to be created for this property this plan amendment includes the creation of the manufacturing park mp planning district and applies it to the leveton property as a way to encourage a campus industrial environment     tdc   area 10 walgraeve industrial area the walgraeve area has excellent development potential this is described in detail in the technical memorandum it contains a very high percentage of large lots of over ten acres and is largely undeveloped it contains approximately 380 acres with approximately 86 acres developed some of the largest industrial users within the community are in this area the general manufacturing mg planning district is to be used in this area as it reflects many of the existing land uses and gives maximum development flexibility there are no residential areas adjacent to the walgraeve area  tdc   area 11 koch industrial area the koch industrial area has some of the most intense industrial development of the industrial planning area and at the same time some of the most significant land in natural states a detailed analysis of the area is given in the technical memorandum the area is oriented on a northsouth basis generally lying between the burlington northern railroad on the east and the metro ugb on the west there are approximately 198 acres of which 54 are developed the tricounty industrial park which straddles the rail line makes up all of the developed property there are two major subareas that are described below 1 the northern half of the property will probably continue to develop in a pattern similar to that found within the industrial park with proper street and utility improvements this will form a solid land use foundation for the total industrial planning area on the western side of the railroad tracks the existing development has taken place under the provisions of the more intensive county zoning designation since the vacant properties in this area are buffered from the residential area the general manufacturing mg planning district is used on the eastern side of the tracks the light manufacturing ml planning district is applied reflecting the existing land uses and the immediate proximity to residential areas 2 in march 201 the industrial land located south of sw blake street was removed from the area 11 koch industrial area and added to the area 15 southwest manufacturing business park area in accordance with the southwest tualatin concept plan accepted in october 2010    tdc   area 12 roamers rest this planning area has two distinct portions the residential area to the west and the commercial area to the east 1 the residential area is identified as an ideal and critical location for higher density housing the flat land relationship to the river proximity to major employment centers and excellent transportation access all lend themselves to a higher density development pattern as it is necessary for the city to create the opportunity to develop a citywide average on vacant buildable land of at least eight dwelling units per acre and with a  ratio of attached to detached units these properties are critical in meeting this goal their higher density pattern offsets lower density patterns for vacant lands in other parts of the community table 91 shows how the three residential planning areas from the 1983 plan amendment work with the existing density pattern of the city to reach the standards a density gradient approach is used in the roamers rest area with rml used on the west adjacent to the agricultural lands rmh in the center portion and rh in the west adjacent to the commercial area this pattern allows for a transition from light to intense land uses on the north side of the highway mobile homes are allowed in this rml area 2 it has been documented elsewhere in this plan that the commercial portion of the roamers rest planning area is an important community resource it is important to protect it and encourage its continued use as an area that provides commercial activities relating to the tualatin river and the highway the commercial recreation cr planning district is used in this area  tdc   area 13 hazelbrook planning area the hazelbrook area has three main components the higher density residential area the single family area and the commercial facilities 1 the higher density residential area is located along the north side of tualatin road extending from the commercial area at the highway intersection to approximately the east end of the manufacturing park area to the south this area is designated for higher residential densities due to its proximity to the major employment center and its excellent transportation access a density gradient approach is used with the rmh and rml planning districts in order to provide for a transition from the commercial uses to the single family areas this area works well to help meet the citys overall housing objectives as can be seen in table 91 2 north and east of the higher density development is a large area slated for the rl district much of the land north of hazelbrook road is in the 100year floodplain development will be limited due to this physical limitation and the regulations of the citys floodplain district along and south of the road however the lands will be available for low density residential development involving traditional single family subdivisions and conditional use process clustered housing styles 3 a neighborhood commercial node is planned for the northeast corner of 115th avenue and tualatin road this two acre parcel is ideally suited for this type of convenience commercial use it is on the intersection of an arterial and a collector it has a relatively square shape and flat topography most importantly it is located at the center of the proposed higher density area and immediately across from a major employment center  tdc   area 14 grahams ferry planning area the grahams ferry area contains three basic components the higher density area around the norwoodboones ferry intersection the higher density area on the east side of sw grahams ferry road at sw helenius road and the lower density residential balance of the area 1 an area with the rml planning district is planned north of the norwood expressway in the vicinity of boones ferry road and on the east side of sw grahams ferry road at sw helenius road this land lends itself to a slightly higher density than traditional singlefamily due to the excellent transportation access and the close relationship to the employment centers in wilsonville it is the determination of this plan that it is appropriate to spread the higher density areas throughout the community rather than concentrating them such as in the roamers rest and hazelbrook planning areas the use of the rml district in this area provides for the needed higher densities with a district that will allow development that is similar in character and density to the rl lands 2 the tonquin scablands area has three special provisions first is the wetland protection district it prohibits building in the defined wetland area and provides a setback from that area second is the greenway and riverbank protection grp district it covers the steep cliff immediately east of the wetlands the grp district will allow residential density transfer to developable portions of an affected property the third provision impacting the scablands involves the various steep sided channels between 108th avenue and boones ferry road it is the policy of this plan to protect these areas on a case by case basis as development occurs by prohibiting building within the channels and allowing residential density transfer to other portions of the affected properties 3 the balance of the grahams ferry planning area is designated in the residential low density rl planning district this land will develop either in the traditional singlefamily subdivision pattern or conditional use process in mobile homes or clustered housing patterns    31300 tdc   area 15 southwest manufacturing business park planning area the southwest manufacturing business park planning area is 4431 acres of land for industrial development located in the tonquin quarry areas west of the portland & western railroad south of sw blake street as far west as a future sw 124th

road and norwood road east of 124th avenue and west of i5 the basalt creek planning area includes a mix of residential zones at various densities a small neighborhood commercial node an employment lands as further described below 1 an area with the rl low density residential zone is planned west of boones ferry road in the approximate area of the basalt creek canyon an area with the rl zone is also planned north of tonquin loop south of helenius road west of grahams ferry road and east of 124th avenue this land will develop either in the traditional singlefamily subdivision pattern or conditional use process in clustered housing patterns 2 an area with the rml medium low density residential zone is planned south of norwood road east of boones ferry road and west of i5 an additional area of rml zone is also planned east of grahams ferry road between the two above described areas of rl zone these areas lends themselves to a slightly higher density than traditional singlefamily due to the excellent transportation access and the close relationship to the employment centers the use of the rml zone in this area provides for the needed higher densities with a zone that will allow development that is similar in character and density to the rl lands 3 an area with the rh high density residential zone is planned north of greenhill road and east of boones ferry road this land lends itself to a higher density due to the excellent transportation access and the close relationship to the employment centers the use of the rh district in this area provides for the needed higher densities 4 a small area with the cn neighborhood commercial zone is planned north of greenhill road and east of boones ferry road this cn zone is intended to provide locations for commercial uses within close proximity to residential areas to provide opportunities to serve the needs of residents for convenience shopping and services this area lends itself to the cn zone due to the excellent transportation access and the close proximity to abutting residential areas of medium to higher densities 5 the balance of the basalt creek planning area is designated in the mp manufacturing park zone the mp district is intended to be conducive to the development and protection of modern largescale specialized manufacturing and related uses and research facilities this area is located north of basalt creek parkway south of tonquin loop east of 124th avenue west of basalt creek canyon and an area of rml zone  42219 chapter 10  community design tdc   background in 1972 the city adopted an ordinance establishing an architectural review board with powers to review the functional and esthetic aspects of each new city structure excluding single family dwellings and minor remodeling when adopting this ordinance the city council found that excessive uniformity dissimilarity inappropriateness or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance of structures and signs and the lack of proper attention to site development and landscaping in the business commercial industrial and certain residential areas of the city hinders the harmonious development of the city impairs the desirability of residence investment or occupation in the city limits the opportunity to attain the optimum use and value of land and improvement adversely affects the stability and value of property produces degeneration of property in such areas with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the peace health and welfare of the city and destroys a proper relationship between the taxable value of property and the cost of municipal services therefor tdc   design objectives the city council also adopted the following objectives as a part of the ordinance establishing the architectural review board 1 encourage originality flexibility and innovation in site planning and development including the architecture landscaping and graphic design of said development 2 discourage monotonous drab unsightly dreary and inharmonious development 3 promote the citys natural beauty and visual character and charm by insuring that structures and other improvements are properly related to their sites and to surrounding sites and structures with due regard to the esthetic qualities of the natural terrain and landscaping and that proper attention is given to exterior appearances of structures and other improvements 4 protect and enhance the citys appeal to tourists and visitors and thus support and stimulate business and industry and promote the desirability of investment and occupancy in business commercial and industrial properties 5 stabilize and improve property values and prevent blighted areas and thus increase tax revenues 6 achieve the beneficial influence of pleasant environments for living and working on behavioral patterns and thus decrease the cost of governmental services 7 foster civic pride and community spirit so as to improve the quality and quantity of citizen participation in local government and in community growth change and improvement 8 sustain the comfort health tranquility and contentment of residents and attract new residents by reason of the citys favorable environment  and thus promote and protect the peace health and welfare of the city 3 amended by  tdc   design guidelinescentral design district the design guidelines in tdc  and  apply to properties in the central design district as shown on figure 734 the design guidelines are to be considered when evaluating development in the central design district  tdc   design improvements while the city has been successful in improving the esthetic quality of the city there remains considerable room for improvement weaknesses in the current design review program include the following 1 lack of strong community support for design excellence 2 lack of comprehensive and definitive architectural and landscape design standards for city development 3 lack of qualified staff and sufficient staff time to work with developers to achieve welldesigned projects and enforce construction conformance with plans approved architectural review process 4 lack of underground electrical wiring program or other program to deal with overhead utility wiring 5 small but ineffective street tree program  tdc   implementation to improve the citys appearance it will be necessary to implement steps that will increase the effectiveness of the design review process to accomplish this the following specific community design objectives are described these objectives are in addition to those included in the enabling ordinance of the architectural review board and are intended to aid implementation of those objectives these additional objectives are to 1 build strong community support for design excellence 2 prepare and adopt specific and enforceable design standards for all private and public development 3 retain additional qualified city staff to work with developers to achieve welldesigned projects and enforce construction conformance with plans approved by the architectural review board 4 develop a longterm underground wiring program for all streets or develop other means of screening overhead wires in cooperation with private utilities 5 develop a strong street tree program  tdc   tree preservation and street tree objectives this section describes the purpose of tree preservation and street tree provisions in the planning district standards 1 develop a program for tree conservation within the city including control over tree removal in order to protect and enhance the esthetic character of tualatin protect and improve air and water quality provide and protect buffering and screening between land uses and provide and protect habitat for wildlife in order to create and preserve a desirable community in which to live work and invest a tualatins tree preservation goal is consistent with the general purpose of the tualatin community plan which is to guide the physical development of the city so as to preserve the natural beauty of the area while accommodating economic growth b tualatins tree preservation goal shall be implemented administration of planning district standards consistent with this goal 2 develop a program for street tree planting along public rightsofway within the city    chapter 11  transportation tdc   background 1 the tualatin transportation system plan tsp establishes a longrange vision for the combination of projects programs and policies that will achieve tualatins transportation goals to do this the tsp looks at the needs of its residents businesses employees and visitors  now year 2012 and what is expected for the future year 2035 tsps are required by the state of oregon for all cities with populations greater than 2500 people the current tsp december 2012 is a major update of the tsp that was adopted in 200 with analysis completed in 2000 the tsp considers the diverse needs of all users of the citys transportation network and sets out recommendations that will serve the needs of transit riders bicyclists pedestrians freight traffic and drivers the tsp has been prepared in compliance with state regional and local plans and policies including the oregon highway plan ohp the state transportation planning rule tpr metros regional transportation plan rtp metros regional transportation functional plan rtfp washington and clackamas counties transportation system plans and tualatins comprehensive plan the tsp presents a vision specific to the citys transportation future while remaining consistent with these state regional and local plans plan elements will be implemented by the city private developers and regional or state agencies 2 regulatory requirements the tpr oar 660012 developed by the state department of land conservation and development dlcd in accordance with state law and oregon revised statute ors  guide preparation of the tsp and require that jurisdictions develop the following a a road plan for a network of arterial and collector roads  b a public transit plan  c a bicycle and pedestrian plan  d an air rail water and pipeline plan  e a transportation financing plan  f policies and ordinances for implementing the tsp the tpr requires that alternate travel modes including cycling walking and transit be given equal consideration with automobile travel and states that reasonable effort must be applied in the development and enhancement of alternate modes in tualatins future transportation system local jurisdictions must also coordinate their plans with relevant state regional and county plans and amend their own ordinances to implement the tsp metro also requires that tsps meet certain requirements that have been adopted in the rtp and rtfp local tsps must a establish an arterial street network considering metros street design concepts and include a conceptual map of new streets  b implement access management standards  c include policies standards and projects that connect to transit stops  d develop a transit plan consistent with the regional transit functional plan  e develop pedestrian bicycle freight parking and transportation system management plans  f ensure that regional transportation needs are incorporated into the tsp  g include regional transportation goals for mode share and vehicles miles traveled 3 the tsp technical memorandum december 201 is adopted by reference as a supporting technical document to the tualatin development tdc the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 was prepared in compliance with the requirements of the tpr and includes the following chapters and appendices introduction modal plans implementation policy and appendix a plan and policy review appendix b existing conditions and deficiencies appendix c future transportation conditions appendix d alternatives analysis appendix e transportation funding and improvement costs appendix f implementing ordinances appendix g public involvement process appendix h bicycle and pedestrian the modal plans element  of the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 addresses those components necessary for development of the future transportation network of the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 was adopted as the transportation element of the tualatin community plan in the spring of 2013 this chapter is intended to provide policy guidance for transportation improvements which are then implemented by the tdc 4 plan process tualatin began the process to update the tsp in 2011 staff organized their work into four basic steps step 1 the team of staff and consultants identified existing and future needs opportunities project goals and objectives city staff and the consultant project team assembled existing and collected new data analyzed the data to identify deficiencies and opportunities and attended a number of community events to ask about issues with the transportation system to form an understanding of transportation problems to be addressed in the tsp additionally the project website included an issues map where visitors to the website could identify transportation problems within the city step 2 next the team created a long list of potential solutions and screened and evaluated potential solutions to see how ideas met project goals and objectives an open house several transportation task force ttf  refer to tdc  meetings and working group meetings helped create andor evaluate potential solutions throughout each of these steps the project team engaged the community to ensure that each element was appropriate for tualatin step 3 the team prepared the draft recommendations for projects to be included into the tsp refining a number of recommendations for the more complex transportation needs and prioritizing the project recommendations to help both the city and the community define which projects and programs should be implemented first step 4 finally the team developed the draft and final tsps for city adoption this process focused on compiling all recommendations into the tsp document and coordinating with relevant stakeholders in reviewing the tsp for completeness and consistency these stakeholders included the community city council tualatin planning commission tpc tualatin parks advisory committee tpark washington county metro oregon department of transportation odot clackamas county adjacent cities and the states dlcd 5 study area in december 200 metro expanded the portland urban growth boundary ugb this expansion included lands bordering tualatins planning area boundary that are intended to develop in the future for industrial uses following studies of impacts of these expansions the citys tsp 2001 was amended to incorporate these new lands a the city of tualatin in conjunction with odot initiated a study of a 23 acre area south of highway 99w and west of sw cipole road in 2004 the northwest tualatin concept plan addressed the impacts of developing this area for industrial uses a technical analysis was prepared for the concept plan following requirements of the tpr that specifically addressed the transportation needs associated with developing the concept plan area at urban densities development of the concept plan was guided by input from an 11member technical advisory committee tac that met four times during the planning process the tac included representatives from the city of tualatin odot washington county bonneville power administration bpa metro us fish and wildlife service representing the tualatin river national wildlife refuge portland general electric pge clean water services cws and trimet mailing to stakeholders and a public open house were used to obtain community feedback on the draft plan the tsp 2001 amendments relating to the northwest tualatin concept plan area were accepted by the city council on  b the city of tualatin in conjunction with odot initiated a study of a 431acre area south of sw tualatinsherwood road and west of the portland & western railroad tracks in 2004 in 201 the city analyzed this area plus an additional 183acres south of the concept plan area the southwest tualatin concept plan addressed the impacts of developing this area for industrial uses particularly the portion of the area designated as a regionally significant industrial area a technical analysis was prepared for the concept plan following the requirements of the tpr that specifically addressed the transportation needs associated with developing the concept plan area at urban densities development of the concept plan was guided by input from a 31member tac that met 12 times during the planning process the tac included representatives from the cities of tualatin sherwood and wilsonville  metro  odot  dlcd  washington county  pge  bpa  cws  oregon department of geology and mineral industries  coffee creek correctional facility  tualatin valley fire & rescue tvf&r  trimet  genessee and wyoming railroad  and property owners from the tonquin industrial group the itel properties area and from tigard sand & gravel mailings to stakeholders and four public open houses were used to obtain community feedback on the draft plan the tsp 2001 amendments relating to the southwest tualatin concept plan area were accepted by the city council on  c the study area for the current tualatin tsp 2012 is comprised of the tualatin planning area boundary with one additionthe basalt creek planning area between tualatin and wilsonville this area outside of the planning area boundary but within the study area was included because of the transportation impact that it could have on the citys transportation network associated with the potential development of residential and employment areas the study area is shown on several of the tsps figures including figure 111 functional classification plan 6 public involvement the tsp planning process actively engaged the citizens of tualatin in the production of its tsp residents business owners employees and agency partners were encouraged to participate and were provided with multiple ways to share their thoughtsfrom initial goal development and issue identification to evaluation and screening the public involvement plan outlined a thorough outreach process making it easy and fun for the public to share ideas the process provided meaningful ways to influence outcomes and took advantage of existing communication networks to reach more people a transportation task force the public involvement plan established a clear decisionmaking framework for the tsp the transportation task force ttf with input from working groups advised the tualatin planning commission tpc the tpc then made a recommendation to the city council which then adopted the final tsp technical memorandum december 2012 and any changes to the citys addition the tpark made recommendations on the bicycle and pedestrian elements to the city council each of these organizations received regular project updates from city staff throughout the process and each had representative members on the ttf these groups were given the opportunity to provide their recommendation before the ttf decisions were forwarded to tpc and the city council the ttf was formed in november 2011 for the purpose of advising the tpc and city council about the needs and concerns of the community with regard to transportation the city council citizen involvement committee selected ttf members carefully to be representative of neighborhoods the business community and the interests of tualatins advisory committees members and alternates were selected from a pool of applications neighboring communities counties tvf&r odot metro and trimet also had representatives on the ttf additional information about the ttf working groups and other aspects of the public involvement process for the tsp are included in appendix g of the tsp technical memorandum december 2012          tdc   transportation goals and objectives 1 over a span of three meetings the ttf prepared a vision for the tsp conveyed as a set of goals and objectives in early 2012 they adopted seven principal goals organized into the following goal categories goal 1 access and mobility goal 2 safety goal 3 vibrant community goal 4 equity goal 5 economy goal 6 health and the environment goal 7 ability to be implemented these goals and their associated objectives were also discussed by the community at the first open house in february 2012 and by tpc tpark and city council the full description of goals and objectives served as the basis for the tsps evaluation framework this means that all tsp recommendations were tied back to the underlying vision as established by these groups 2 goal 1 access and mobility maintain and enhance the transportation system to reduce travel times provide traveltime reliability provide a functional and smooth

classification plan defines the intended operations and character of roadways within the overall transportation system including standards for roadway and rightofway width access spacing and pedestrian and bicycle facilities the city of tualatins functional classification system applies to roadways owned by the city the county and the state and includes principal arterials major arterials minor arterials major collectors minor collectors connector and local roads figure 111 presents the updated functional classification plan for the city of tualatin the arterial roadways carry a high number of vehicles including transit and freight vehicles and provide mobility with few opportunities for local access collectors assemble traffic from a neighborhood or district and deliver it to the closest arterial street collectors serve shorter trip lengths than arterials and have more local access opportunities both arterials and collectors within tualatin are owned by a variety of agencies including the city odot and clackamas and washington counties the roadway owners are responsible for maintenance and upkeep on the roadways and they make decisions on upgrades to their facilities tsp technical memorandum december 2012 describes the functional classifications and the purpose they are intended to serve in more detail  appendix a plan and policy review of the tsp technical memorandum provides a detailed description of the various policies associated with roadway ownership there are a number of existing freight and truck routes city designated by the city the state and the federal government these routes have specific design criteria and mobility standards to ensure that these roadways serve freight traffic 2 functional classification policies functional classification policies support the citys transportation goals and objectives included in tdc  policies help provide direction for roadways and roadway classifications a functional classification policy 1 major and minor arterials will comprise the main backbone of the freight system ensuring that freight trucks are able to easily move within in and out of the city b functional classification policy 2 continue to construct existing and future roadways to standard when possible for the applicable functional classification to serve transportation needs within the city 3 street design standards street design standards by functional classification are included in tdc 4 the rtps regional street design system describes typical features of its street design designations for comparison purposes metros regional street design system map has been recreated in figure 112 the tualatin tsps street design standards for roadways shown on the rtp regional street design system map are generally in conformance with the rtps concepts particularly in the areas of pedestrian and bicycle lanes landscape strips and medians or center turn lanes       62705   022513 tdc   street system modal plan 1 the street system modal plan consists of several sections a listing of street urban upgrades and new streets other intersectionspecific or noncapacity streets projects access management policies and traffic operation standards this modal plan is included in its entirety in the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 and pertinent sections are included in this section of tdc 2 summary of limitations and needs of street system key needs identified for the street system include a improved roadway connectivity new roadway connections should be explored to improve eastwest connectivity south of sw tualatinsherwood road and northsouth regional connectivity metro rtp policies related to a complete street system identify onemile spacing between major arterial streets with collector streets or minor arterials spaced a halfmile apart b improved travel time along congested corridors focus on reducing vehicle delay on key corridors c intersection improvements address intersection delay and intersection issues in congested areas d upgrading roadway geometries city design standards for roadway width sidewalks and bicycle facilities should be followed where specific deficiencies have been identified e additionally safety is a concern for the community safety issues were identified at the following intersections i sw tualatinsherwood road and sw boones ferry road ii sw nyberg street and i5 southbound off ramps 3 roadway policies the following establish the citys policies on roadways a roadway policy 1 implement design standards that provide clarity to developers while maintaining flexibility for environmental constraints b roadway policy 2 ensure that street designs accommodate all anticipated users including transit freight bicyclists and pedestrians and those with limited mobility c roadway policy 3 work with metro and adjacent jurisdictions when extending roads or multiuse paths from tualatin to a neighboring city 4 local streets plan the rtp calls for cities to identify all contiguous areas of vacant and redevelopable parcels of five or more acres planned or zoned for residential or mixeduse development and to prepare a conceptual new streets plan map figure 113 presents the city of tualatins local streets plan the intent of this map is to identify the locations of future street connections and desired connections within future development that promote a connected street system the endpoints of the connections should be considered fixed unless the community development director or their designee determines that an alternate connection point is preferable due to safety operations improved connectivity concerns or environmental impacts the routes connecting endpoints may vary as long as a reasonably direct route between the two points is provided 5 access management access management is important to maintain traffic flow and ensure safety on the citys arterial street network including sw tualatinsherwood road oregon highway 99w or 99w and other hightraffic routes limiting the number of points where traffic can enter and exit reduces potential conflict points improves roadway performance and reduces the need for capacity expansion the city manages access of the tdc  that chapter details where access is permitted on arterial and collector roads within the city tualatin must coordinate with washington and clackamas counties and odot to manage access on roads the city does not own including sw tualatinsherwood road sw cipole road sw 65th avenue sw borland road and sections of sw boones ferry road of the tdc most recently updated in 201 has specific access standards for each arterial road within tualatin it provides recommendations for future changes on specific roads as well as potential solutions for access issues a access management policies access management policies are i access management policy 1 no new driveways or streets on arterial roadways within the city except where noted in the tdc usually when no alternative access is available ii access management policy 2 where a property abuts an arterial and another roadway the access for the property shall be located on the other roadway not the arterial iii access management policy 3 adhere to intersection spacing included in of the tdc iv access management policy 4 limit driveways to rightin rightout where appropriate medians or other barriers to restrict left turns v access management policy 5 look for opportunities to create joint accesses for multiple properties where possible to reduce the number of driveways on arterials vi access management policy 6 no new singlefamily home duplex or triplex driveways on major collector roadways within the city unless no alternative access is available vii access management policy 7 on collector roadways residential commercial and industrial driveways where the frontage is greater or equal to 70 feet are permitted minimum spacing at 100 feet uses with less than 50 feet of frontage shall use a common joint access where available 6 traffic operations standards this section includes a discussion of standards included in the ohp odots highway design manual hdm and the tpr and city documents for local roadways based on the preferred system for operational analysis there are four intersections that do not meet jurisdictional standards after mitigation strategies are included these intersections that experience operational constraints are in the sw lower boones ferry roadi5 interchange area and are due to the additional motor vehicle trips associated with the widening of sw boones ferry road from sw martinazzi avenue to sw lower boones ferry road the first mitigation strategies developed explored transportation system management techniques maximizing operations at intersections timing adjustments andor phasing adjustments if system management techniques did not achieve acceptable jurisdictional operations localized capacity improvements were explored for example a new turn pocket generally these improvements allowed for adequate signal operations under a mitigated scenario there were some intersections located in the downtown core area that were not able to meet jurisdictional standards without the implementation of significant capacity andor roadway widening improvements these types of major infrastructure improvements were deemed to be too impactful to the downtown core and were not included in the final preferred system improvements the downtown tualatin area is designated a town center by metro and using that designation town centers are allowed to not meet jurisdictional standards alternate standards for town centers in the rtp are based on a twohour peak hour the standard volume to capacity ratio vc for the first peak hour is 11 and for the second peak hour is 099 these intersections meet the rtp standards and there is no need for additional alternate mobility standards    tdc   transit modal plan 1 public transit in tualatin is envisioned to be multifaceted by including local and express bus service commuter rail potential high capacity transit and local transit shuttle services in addition the communitys vision for public transit includes improvements in the quality of transit service as well as land uses that better complement and encourage use of transit in downtown tualatin figure 115 presents the updated transit system for the city of tualatin 2 summary of limitations and needs for transit trimet does not provide transit service within all areas of tualatin or on all major corridors no transit service is provided on sw tualatinsherwood road or sw tualatin road and many residents in the western portion of the city live more than a mile from the nearest transit line many residents who do live near a bus line are not served by transit at regular intervals during the day according to the conceptual linking tualatin plan draft 2012 over 11000 workers and over 5000 households over half of the people living and working in the city lack regular transit service within a quarter mile of where they live or work because of the limitations of service during offpeak hours noncommuting trips may be more difficult to complete using transit in tualatin community feedback indicated the following specific needs for transit a service connecting the west side of tualatin to the downtown core  b parkandrides in the west and south areas of tualatin  c extended service hours including weekend service  d more direct connections to places other than downtown portland additional needs for transit stops include direct and safe access to transit stops and bicyclist and pedestrian amenities at stops especially where transit riders are able to transfer lines or modes 3 transit policies the city of tualatins policies on public transit are as follows a transit policy 1 partner with trimet to jointly develop and implement a strategy to improve existing transit service in tualatin b transit policy 2 partner with the tualatin chamber of commerce to support grant requests that would expand the tualatin shuttle services c transit policy 3 partner with trimet metro and neighboring communities to plan the development of highcapacity transit in the southwest corridor as adopted in the metro high capacity transit system plan d transit policy 4 partner with trimet metro and neighboring communities to plan development of highcapacity transit connecting tualatin and oregon city as adopted in the metro high capacity transit system plan e transit policy 5 coordinate with odot and neighboring communities on conversations related to oregon passenger rail between portland and eugene f transit policy 6 develop and improve pedestrian and bicycle connections and access to transit

with trimet metro and odot to explore service frequency improvements and the possible inclusion of a second wes station in south tualatin i in addition to the transit policies included here bicycle and pedestrian policies 7 and 8 included in tdc  are applicable to transit    tdc   pedestrian bicycle and multiuse path modal plan 1 this modal plan describes pedestrian and bicycle improvements to comfortably and safely accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians within the city these include multiuse paths specific bicycle and pedestrian improvements and street upgrades figure 114 presents the updated bicycle and pedestrian system for the city of tualatin 2 summary of limitations and needs for bicycle and pedestrian facilities this section summarizes limitations and needs for bicycle and pedestrian facilities and multiuse paths a full description of existing conditions and deficiencies for the bicycle pedestrian and pathway system can be found in appendix b of the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 a bicycle facility needs existing bicycle facilities in tualatin have a few gaps and challenging connections i difficult leftturn maneuvers  ii difficult areas with low bike visibility  iii bike lanes outside of turn lanes  iv obstacles within the bike lanes  v gaps in the network  and vi in addition to these needs there are a number of highcrash locations most crashes result in an injury to the bicyclist and most occur on a dry roadway surface in daylight conditions highcrash locations include sw boones ferry road and sw tualatinsherwood road  as well as the sw nyberg road interchange ramps at i5 b pedestrian facility needs pedestrian facility needs include i fill sidewalk gaps on arterials and collector streets at a sw herman road  b sw grahams ferry road  c sw boones ferry road  d sw blake street between sw 105th and sw 108th avenues  e sw sagert street overpass over i5  and f sw 105th avenue between sw paulina drive and sw blake street ii narrow or obstructed sidewalks iii wide or angled crosswalks at intersections iv difficult crossing on major roadways sw boones ferry road sw tualatinsherwood road and roadways in the downtown core v most of the pedestrian crashes reported in the 5year crash study timeframe occurred on sw boones ferry road generally when a vehicle failed to yield for pedestrians most crashes occurred when a vehicle was turning c multiuse path needs additional bicycle and pedestrian connections over the tualatin river are needed to connect with existing regional paths  as well as to provide alternate routes to the one existing kiakuts bridge that is exclusively for bicycles and pedestrians from tualatin community park to durham city park in durham additionally many of the existing multiuse paths are fragmented and do not connect signs and other wayfinding guides are needed to inform bicyclists or pedestrians how to move among the various pathways and from the pathways to onstreet facilities the planned multiuse path network is only half constructed once the system is complete the multiuse path network will be more comprehensive 3 bicycle and pedestrian policies the city of tualatins policies on bicycle and pedestrian facilities are as follows a bicycle and pedestrian policy 1 support safe routes to schools srts for all tualatin schools b bicycle and pedestrian policy 2 work with partner agencies to support and build trails c bicycle and pedestrian policy 3 allow wider sidewalks downtown for strolling and outdoor cafes d bicycle and pedestrian policy 4 add benches along multiuse paths for pedestrians throughout the city especially in the downtown core e bicycle and pedestrian policy 5 develop and implement a toolbox consistent with washington county for midblock pedestrian crossings f bicycle and pedestrian policy 6 implement bicycle and pedestrian projects to help the city achieve the regional nonsingleoccupancy vehicle modal targets in table 111 g bicycle and pedestrian policy 7 implement bicycle and pedestrian projects to provide pedestrian and bicycle access to transit and essential destinations for all mobility levels including direct comfortable and safe pedestrian and bicycle routes h bicycle and pedestrian policy 8 ensure that there are bicycle and pedestrian facilities at transit stations i bicycle and pedestrian policy 9 create on and offstreet bicycle and pedestrian facilities connecting residential commercial industrial and public facilities such as parks the library and schools j bicycle and pedestrian policy 10 create obvious and easy to use connections between on and offstreet bicycle and pedestrian facilities and integrate offstreet paths with onstreet facilities 4 bicycle boulevards currently there are no existing bicycle boulevards in tualatin though washington county has bicycle boulevard policies and design standards bicycle boulevards are roadways that use a variety of design treatments to reduce vehicle speeds so that motorists and bicyclists generally travel at the same speed to create a safer and more comfortable environment for all users bicycle boulevards may include a variety of applications ranging from minor street signing enhancements such as shared lane markings to larger scale projects for example bikeonly access at intersections traffic diverters boulevards also incorporate treatments to facilitate safe and convenient crossings where bicyclists must traverse major streets traffic controls along a boulevard may assign priority to while encouraging traffic to use alternate parallel routes bicycle boulevards work best in wellconnected street grids where riders can follow intuitive and reasonably direct routes boulevards also work best when higherorder parallel streets exist to serve traffic bicycle boulevards are generally located on streets with lower traffic volumes and vehicle speeds such as minor collectors or local streets passing neighborhoods typically a bicycle boulevard would be located on a street where vehicles travel less than 30 miles per hour and average daily traffic volume is less than 3000 vehicles in both directions proposed bicycle boulevards in tualatin are shown on figure 114 these are all low volume low speed streets that connect neighborhoods with roadways and trails where bicycle infrastructure investments have been made as a shortterm action the city should consider signing these roadways as bicycle routes and monitor usage on an annual basis as bicycle usage increases and bicyclists and drivers become more used to sharing travel lanes further investments could be considered to enhance safety for bicyclists      tdc   freight plan 1 efficient truck movement plays a critical role in the economic wellbeing and development of tualatin trucks must be able to access commercial industrial manufacturing distribution and other employment areas both in tualatin and connecting to the regional system future commercialindustrial uses are expected to be located consistent with the land uses identified in the comprehensive plan which matches the current planning district designations as codified in the tdc 2 the freight network illustrated in figure 116 is largely consistent with the functional classification plan figure 111 which strives to connect industrial and manufacturing uses to the regional and state transportation network via a series of major and minor arterial roadways the movement of raw materials and finished products via designated truck routes provides for efficient movement of goods while maintaining neighborhood livability public safety and minimizing maintenance costs of the roadway system federally and state designated truck routes part of the national highway system nhs have been identified on i5 and or 99w metro identifies road connectors in the rtp freight network on sw 124th avenue sw tualatinsherwood road sw lower boones ferry road and sw boones ferry road the city of tualatin designates additional truck routes on roadway facilities that connect commercialindustrial districts within the city to major arterials and ultimately to or 99w i5 and i205 3 the needs of the freight system are consistent with those identified in the street system plan tdc  projects that address needs related to truck routes either directly or by providing alternate routes that improve traffic operations along truck routes serve the needs of the freight system all new roadways should be built to current city design standards to meet the operational needs of trucks on designated truck routes    tdc   rail plan 1 portland and western railroad pnwr owns and operates two freight rail lines within the city one track running northsouth accommodates both freight and the wes commuter rail and an eastwest line runs along the south side of sw herman road as of november 2012 the eastwest line carries one train daily in each direction and the north south has two freight trains daily in addition to the wes trains described in the transit section there are 13 gated public railroad crossings in tualatin and a number of additional driveways or private roads that cross the railroad the private crossings are stop controlled but not signalized freight trains have the rightofway at all intersections the low number of trains does not present a large safety concern in the city and recent quiet zone work done in conjunction with the northsouth wes rail line opening added gates at all public crossings 2 pnwr has no current plans to increase freight service although the eastwest track runs adjacent to manufacturing areas no rail sidings or other access to businesses are planned 3 freight rail policies following are policies for freight rail a freight rail policy 1 continue to coordinate with pnwr and trimet to ensure that railroad crossings are safe and have few noise impacts on adjacent neighborhoods b freight rail policy 2 look for opportunities to shift goods shipments to rail to help reduce the demand for freight on tualatins roads c freight rail policy 3 look for opportunities to create multimodal hubs to take advantage of the freight rail lines 4 passenger rail policies the city of tualatins policies on public transit are described in tdc  as part of the transit modal plan those policies that may relate to the existing heavy rail lines in tualatin include transit policies 3 4 5 and 8    tdc   water pipeline and air plan this section includes the water pipeline and air plans 1 water plan the tualatin river is the only large waterway within the city of tualatin the river is used primarily for recreation and is open for canoeing and kayaking therefore the tsp does not include any specific policies programs or projects for the tualatin river as part of the transportation network however several projects are proposed in other sections of the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 to increase access to the river for recreation purposes 2 pipeline plan a natural gas transmission pipeline and a gasoline pipeline cross city there is no anticipated need to increase pipeline capacity or construct new pipelines city and therefore no such improvements are proposed in the tsp 3 air plan there are no airports within the city of tualatin although several airports are located within 30 miles of the city the aurora state airport hillsboro municipal airport and portland international airport these airports meet the commercial freight and business aviation needs of tualatin residents no plans are proposed to construct airport facilities within the city of tualatin  existing airports are anticipated to continue serving the citizens of tualatin adequately    tdc   transportation demand management 1 the tpr requires all cities with populations greater than 25000 people to develop a transportation demand management tdm plan the rtp also requires that tdm strategies be used to encourage alternative transportation modes and achieve higher vehicle occupancy targets tdm measures are designed to change travel behavior in order to reduce the need for more road capacity and improve performance of the road system typical tdm projects include encouraging use of travel modes other than the auto ride sharing and measures to reduce the need for travelsuch as telecommuting policies tdm policies and projects can be costeffective ways to reduce congestion by encouraging the use of other modes reducing the need for travel or reducing the number of vehicle miles driven the city of tualatin can implement a range of tdm measures to manage travel demand in conjunction with partner organizations in many cases providing bicycle pedestrian and transit infrastructure can be effective means to encourage drivers to switch to other modes many of the pedestrian bicycle and transit improvements proposed in other sections of the tsp can be considered tdm measures as they encourage use of travel modes other than the auto in addition to these infrastructure projects a number of strategies are applicable to tualatin as discussed in detail in the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 2 transportation demand management policies the following policies support other modal plans in the tsp and help tualatin meet its modeshare targets as required by the rtp and presented in table 111 a tdm policy 1 support demand reduction strategies such as ride sharing preferential parking and flextime programs b tdm policy 2 partner with the tualatin chamber of commerce the westside transportation alliance major employers and business groups to implement tdm programs c tdm policy 3 explore the use of new tdm strategies to realize more efficient use of the citys transportation system d tdm policy 4 support washington countys regional tdm programs and policies to reduce the number of singleoccupancy vehicle sov trips e tdm policy 5 promote the use and expansion of the tualatin shuttle program 3 metro modal targets metro in its 2035 rtp established modal targets for how residents in the region will make trips in 2040 these are separated out by regional designations tualatin has a number of designations within the city limits as described in the following sections and shown in figures 94 design type boundaries and 112 metro regional street design system a town center this designation is consistent with the town center plan study area centered on the lake of the commons and includes land south of the tualatin river and west of i5 including the tualatin community park the western boundary is sw 95th avenue south to sw tualatinsherwood road and then southern boundary is sw tualatinsherwood road to approximately sw boones ferry road then continues east

e neighborhoods neighborhood areas include southern tualatin near sw boones ferry road northern tualatin north of sw tualatin road and eastern tualatin excluding the hospital area and the greenways and parks f these designations have modal targets associated with them as seen in table 111 the nondrivealone modal target for tualatin is 4555 percent in the town center and station community and 4045 percent for the employment land parks and natural areas and neighborhoods      tdc   transportation system management 1 transportation system management tsm measures are designed to increase the efficiency safety capacity and level of service of the transportation system without physically increasing roadway capacity typical tsm projects include traffic light synchronization traffic calming travel information systems access management and parking management strategies many of the projects listed in the modal plansincluding the transit pedestrian and bicycle and access management plansqualify as tsm measures many tsm tools can be implemented inexpensively to help make the existing system work more efficiently a wide range of tsm strategies are applicable to tualatin these are discussed in detail in the tsp technical memorandum december 2012  tdc   parking plan 1 the city owns several public parking lots in downtown tualatin to support denser development in the citys core area a separate taxing district has been created to support ongoing maintenance and operations of these parking lots the city completed a study in 2011 which identified that the existing parking supply is sufficient to meet the parking demand in downtown tualatin 2 the rtfp requires parking policies and a parking plan in a tsp or other planning document the current tdc includes parking minimums and is compliant with this requirement  tdc   implementation 1 the project table for each modal plan in the tualatin tsp technical memorandum december 2012 includes recommendations for applicable funding sources additionally the relative importance of tsp projects are identified in the project tables based on community goals the magnitude of the deficiency or issue that the project addresses and the ability to secure funding conduct engineering and build a project appendix e of the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 provides a detailed description of transportation funding and improvement costs for all of the tsps recommendations 2 a variety of established federal state regional and local funding sources are available to fund future transportation projects in the tualatin tsp technical memorandum december 2012 depending on the eligibility requirements implementation of tsp projects will depend on funding and community priorities 3 prioritization prioritization of projects within the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 is separated into three categories shortterm mediumterm and longterm short term projects are expected to be built within zerofive years while mediumterm are fiveten years and longterm projects are expected to be built in the 1020 year time frame prioritization is determined based on a combination of the most important projects to implement first the ease of implementation and the potential costsome projects will take a number of years to identify and secure funding some projects will also need regional coordination and support which may take time to secure an agreement prioritization is an estimate longterm projects may be implemented sooner than 1020 years due to funding becoming available a high degree of community support or other factors the suggested priority for projects in the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 is a general guide and not a required timeframe the city will need to periodically update the tsp and will review the need and timing for longerterm improvements at those times prioritizing specific nearterm projects will occur annually when the city updates its fiveyear financial plan and prepares its capital improvement plan cip for the following year future road improvements or related transportation projects listed or not listed in the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 are not required to be reviewed and approved land use process the construction of roads storm drainage water sewer and electrical facilities in conjunction with local development activity should be coordinated if the city of tualatin is to continue to develop in an orderly and efficient way consequently the plans proposed in the tsp technical memorandum december 2012 should be considered in light of developing infrastructure sequencing plans and may need to be modified accordingly    table 111 metro modal targets 2040 regional designation nondrivealone modal target 2040 regional

covering the city limits and the area out to the urban growth boundary ugban active plan 2 in accordance with the urban planning area agreement between the city and washington county and an intergovernmental agreement between the city and the city of portland the city of tualatin is responsible for providing water service in the city of tualatin the city of tualatin obtains its water from the city of portland 3 in 1990 and 1999 minor amendments to tdc were adopted in 2000 and 2002 the city contracted with ch2m hill to update the citys water master plan the 2000 update reflected tualatins growth and refined the 1983 plan 4 the 2003 report tualatin water master plan update the master plan was the basis for amending the tualatin development tdc in 2003 the purpose of the 2003 master plan was to provide the city with a comprehensive water master plan for future development of the water system the 2003 master plan included a description of the existing water system the planning criteria a water system analysis and a capital improvement plan the 2003 master plan study area was the same as the tualatin community plan plus it included the southwest manufacturing business park 5 the july 2013 water master plan report was prepared as an update to the 2003 master plan its purpose is to be a comprehensive analysis of the citys water system to identify system deficiencies determine future water distribution system supply requirements and recommend water system facility improvements that correct system deficiencies and provide for future system expansion 6 the july 2013 water master plan anticipates demand as residential growth from redevelopment and infill within the town center area and industrial and employment growth in the southwest concept plan

code fire flow criteria adopted by similar communities and fire flow guidelines as developed by the american water works association is presented in table 42 of the 2013 master plan 3 fire protection is not dependent on the water distribution system alone fire flows greater than 3500 gpm can be reduced with individual fire suppression systems such as sprinklers chemical and alarm systems and fireresistant construction onsite supply and other methods developments with fire flows greater than 3500 gpm will need to supplement public water system flows systems such as those noted in the prior sentence the july 2013 master plans recommended minimum criteria for fire suppression flows for single family residential is 1000 gpm for multifamily is 2000 gpm and commercial industrial and

criteria    6 112519 tdc   existing system 1 the city of tualatins sewage waste is treated at clean water services durham advanced waste water treatment plant the waste is collected and piped to the plant via a network of collectors trunks and interceptors the main interceptor transporting waste from tualatin is the lower tualatin interceptor which is primarily fed by gravity sewers five areas are served by pressure mains and pump stations a brief description of the existing system follows and it is shown on map 131 2 except for the five areas discussed below the city is served by gravity lines the main interceptors in this system are the lower tualatin interceptor which conveys sewage from the city to the durham advanced waste water treatment plant the nyberg trunk line which runs from the lower tualatin interceptor east under i5 serving the area east of i5 and south of the river the bluff cipole trunk line and lateral which extends to the west from the lower tualatin interceptor and the tualatinsherwood trunk which serves the area west of 99w and north of sw tualatin road the bluff cipole trunk line is the main interceptor serving the western and southern portions of the tualatin planning area the five areas currently served by pump stations are as follows a the area east of i5 and north of the tualatin river is served by a pump station located at 65th and childs road the pump station discharges into the city of lake oswego sanitary sewer system this area is served by lake oswego contract agreement with the city of tualatin b the area along nyberg street and borland road east of i5 is served by five pump stations the pump stations pump sewage to the nyberg interceptor and then into the lower tualatin interceptor c the area east of i5 and south of sagert street is served by a pump station at the intersection of 65th and i205 this pump station discharges into the gravity line on sw 65th at the intersection of 65th and borland d the south portion of the area west of sw boones ferry road and east of sw grahams ferry road is served by a pump station at the south end of victoria woods subdivision which discharges into the bluff cipole lateral e the area east of sw cipole road north of sw herman road and south of 99w is served by a pump station at sw cipole road and cummins creek      7 112519 tdc   proposed system 1 the proposed sewage collection system is illustrated in map 131 2 the majority of the trunk and interceptor lines were constructed but some are not of sufficient capacity the master plan reviewed the system and recommended improvements the master plan focused on sewer system capacity deficiencies consistent with cwss sewer design criteria it compared peak hydraulic grade lines hgls for each segment of the system with pipe slopes and ground surface elevations city staff also identified locations requiring maintenance or replacement due to degradation and aging of the system 3 because the system is essentially built and several trunk and interceptor lines are too small the master plans recommendations primarily were to increase trunk and interceptor line sizes 4 new collection system pipes and at least one pump station will be needed to serve the southwest tualatin concept plan area the actual configuration will depend on individual development plans land use type and location site grading and other factors not known in 2010 the southwest tualatin concept plan and the basalt creek planning areas have conceptual sewer and pump station layouts that will be dependent on development          8 112519 tdc   project list and cost estimates projects and cost estimates including engineering and administration for the major improvements in tualatins sewage collection system are contained in the sewer master plan no attempt has been made to adjust prices to a future date the cost figures include only city costs not clean water services        9 112519 tdc   financing methods 1 financing the improvements proposed in the sewer master plan will be provided primarily by local improvement districts connection charges system development charges and revenue bonds and private investors for residential commercial and industrial developments construction of interceptors and trunks may involve a combination of costs to developers contributions from tualatins sewer fund and assessments against properties benefited 2 the citys sewer utility finances were reviewed in the sewer master plan it was estimated the capital expenditures for the recommended improvement projects will cause shortfalls to meet the shortfalls the city can explore additional revenue sources such as revenue bonds the specific requirements will be determined by a cost of service rate study the city can also review sewer rates and system development charges with cws to ensure revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses future capital projects and outstanding debt service ongoing rehabilitation and replacement projects to repair structural deficiencies as they develop should be considered for inclusion in capital budget planning      10 112519 chapter 14  drainage plan and surface water

the southwest tualatin concept plan 2010 and tdc public improvements the 1975 tualatin drainage plan defines and describes the existing and planned drainage in the tualatin planning area the tualatin drainage plan is periodically updated as drainage studies are prepared by the city or for development projects in september of 199 the city adopted the hedges creek subbasin plan hcs plan and incorporated the drainage improvements and drainage pattern modifications in the hedges creek subbasin into the tualatin drainage plan the hcs plan consists of the drainage and storm water management activities and programs recommended in of the hedges creek subbasin strategies hcss report prepared by the city and clean water services cws cws began subbasin planning work for the hedges creek basin in 199 based on two previous storm water and nonpoint source plans the tualatin basinwide report and technical guidelines and the cws surface water management plan the hcss report incorporates the original hedges creek subbasin management plan completed in october 1992 and the hydraulic study of the hedges creek marsh report completed in october 1994 the surface water management policies and requirements in the swm adopted by the city and other jurisdictions in the tualatin river basin to implement cws requirements for control of sedimentation and water quality the drainage and surface management development requirements of the tualatin drainage plan and swm implemented in tdc public improvements    tdc   drainage plan 1 the tualatin drainage plan is the citys drainage plan it was originally prepared by robert a wright consulting engineers in 1972 and adopted in 1975  and in 1979 as an element of the tualatin community plan  the tualatin drainage plan is referenced in the technical memoranda tdc  with the supporting technical material the tualatin drainage plan provides an overall view of the drainage system its major problems and their solutions and is the citys storm water and surface water drainage policy 2 the tualatin drainage plan was updated in the fall of 1995 by the hedges creek subbasin plan the hcs plan is outlined in of the hcss report and implements the recommended drainage and storm water management activities and facilities the hcs plan relies on the technical data and analysis documented in the hcss report the hcss report and the hcs plan identify the critical importance of the hedges creek marsh to drainage storm water management and water quality in the subbasin the hcs plan provides for drainage improvements storm water detention requirements and a number of nonstructural activities for better management of water quantity and water quality in the hedges creek subbasin 3 map 141 is from figure i1 of the hcs plan it shows the drainage pattern revisions and drainage system improvements for the hedges creek subbasin the drainage pattern revisions and drainage system improvements shown in map 141 are incorporated into the tualatin drainage plan 4 the hcss report is a comprehensive technical document that provides data and analysis of storm water drainage in the hedges creek subbasin from an analysis of several alternatives the report recommended specific management activities and facilities to control water quantity and quality problems associated with urban storm water runoff in the hedges creek subbasin the hcs plan incorporates the reports recommended activities and facilities 5 the northwest tualatin concept plan 2005 identifies storm water drainage options for the area west of cipole road and

natural features which provide the city with excellent opportunities for outdoor recreation in attractive settings the tualatin river and the areas many small creeks provide opportunities for wateroriented recreation and greenway loops connecting various parts of the city several forested and wetland areas remain undeveloped and available for the neighborhood park types of recreation as well as for natural areas because of tualatins rapid development the city must aggressively promote the acquisition of park lands before they are developed for other uses 2 it is the basic premise of this plan that tualatin should develop the highestquality park and recreation system to offset the effects of large amounts of industrial and commercial growth that are proposed for the central portions of the city while the citys commercial and industrial development will be reviewed citys architectural review process an atmosphere of intensive development will remain that can be partially offset by large amounts of open space land that are visible and accessible to the public additionally the property values of this new commercial and industrial development should create a favorable financial environment enabling the city to maintain a reasonable tax rate while providing a highquality recreation system 3 the parks and recreation master plan is adopted by reference as a supporting technical document to the tualatin community plan the parks and recreation master plan contains detailed analysis discussions and recommendations on community parks neighborhood parks greenways

background tualatins history is directly tied to the agricultural based economy which historically supported the majority of its residents the development patterns from this agricultural base left a scattering of residential dwellings and structures on the landscape with a small core area for retail activities this pattern continued until the 1970s when rapid growth came to the area from the 1970s to 1991 the city experienced rapid growth in residential commercial and industrial activities the once thriving agricultural economic base was transformed into a suburban extension of the portland metropolitan area along with this economic prosperity came the loss of many of the historic resources which once identified the community the city of tualatin comprehensive planphase itechnical memoranda developed in 1979 identified seven structures in the central area of downtown these structures were subsequently given historic status and regulations pertaining to modifications demolitions and alterations for the designated resources were adopted and integrated into the tualatin development technical memoranda further indicated additional historic resources are located in tualatin and that urban development would cause the loss of these resources the report concluded that the city should investigate ways to preserve the history of the community  tdc   assumptions the following are general assumptions used to formulate the historic preservation plan 1 the demand for the citys residential commercial and industrial land will continue and will create pressure to demolish and remove historic resources 2 residential commercial and industrial development has caused a number of the historic resources in the city to be demolished relocated or altered 3 the city has historic resources which have not been identified or inventoried 4 alterations have occurred to buildings structures and sites which have diminished their value as historic resources 5 a mechanism needs to be established to provide an ongoing survey of the citys historic resources 6 many of tualatins historic resources have been lost due to an inadequate comprehensive plan element concerning historic preservation  tdc   objectives the objectives of the historic preservation plan are to 1 promote the historic educational architectural cultural economic and general welfare of the public identification preservation restoration rehabilitation protection and use of those buildings structures sites and objects of historic interest within the city  2 foster community and neighborhood pride and sense of identity based on recognition and use of historic resources  3 strengthen the economy of the city by encouraging property owners to preserve historic resources for tourists visitors and residents  4 encourage public awareness understanding and appreciation of the citys history and culture  5 promote the enjoyment and use of historic resources appropriate for the education and recreation of the people of tualatin  6 identify and preserve diverse architectural styles reflecting periods of the citys historical and architectural development encourage complementary design and construction for alterations affecting historic resources and encourage relocation of historic resources over demolition  7 enhance property values and increase economic and financial benefits to the city and its inhabitants  8 identify and resolve conflicts between the preservation of historic resources and alternative land uses  9 integrate the management of historic resources into public and private land management and development processes  10 carry out the provisions of statewide planning goal 5  11 prepare a report describing the comprehensive history of the citys past  and 12 identify and list additional properties to the current list of protected historic resources 13 upon annexation potential historic resources located outside of the city but within the citys planning area shall proceed significance review conflicting use and economic social environmental and energy analysis  14 review the impacts on landmarks when public improvement projects are proposed  15 retain landmarks in the low density residential rl planning district on parcels which cannot be partitioned or subdivided by preserving and not demolishing or relocating them  16 retain landmarks located on parcels which can be partitioned or subdivided in the low density residential rl planning district by property owners and developers integrating the resource into proposed lot configurations and development proposals  17 allow conflicting uses andor adaptive reuse of the sweek house and smithboone house while maintaining the architectural integrity of the two structures and discourage relocation or demolition  18 allow conflicting uses to develop on the undeveloped portion of the winona cemetery property while maintaining the existing cemetery  19 allow adaptive reuse of the structure at 6825 sw childs road and discourage relocation and demolition  20 encourage adaptive reuse of landmarks in commercial planning districts and discourage relocation and demolition  21 encourage conflicting uses on the isaac ball site while maintaining the architectural integrity of the landmark  22 allow conflicting uses on the little white house site and encourage relocation over demolition  23 allow conflicting uses on the smith row house site and encourage relocation over demolition  24 preserve the cipole school while allowing conflicting uses to occur on undeveloped portions of the site  and 25 allow conflicting uses in manufacturing planning districts and encourage relocation over demolition   chapter 20  sign design tdc   background 1 the city of tualatin is a community of natural beauty quality architecture and landscaping and planned urban design signs are one of the more visual and prominent components of urbanscapes signs have a strong visual impact on the character and quality of the community signs are of primary concern to business owners customers and the public clear and effective signage is essential to the successful operation of businesses and public and semipublic uses and can without distraction facilitate vehicular bicycle and pedestrian movement signage can also however be a significant contributor to visual clutter and blight large garish andor numerous signs designed as attention getters are neither necessary nor desirable in tualatins setting with care signs can serve to effectively identify uses and provide a positive contribution to the citys visual quality 2 the city of tualatin competes with many other oregon national and international communities for economic opportunities since the city relies on its scenery and physical beauty to attract residents and commerce esthetic considerations assume economic value to ensure the city of tualatin is a desirable community in which to live vacation and conduct business and to protect the citys economic base a visually pleasing attractive environment is important and desired  tdc   purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare comprehensive system of effective sign objectives  tdc   objectives the following are the citys sign objectives 1 preserve the right of free speech exercised use of signs 2 protect the public health safety and welfare 3 protect persons and property in rightsofway from unsafe and dangerous signs that distract rather than inform motorists bicyclists and pedestrians 4 protect persons and property from unsafe and dangerous signs due to natural forces including but not limited to wind earthquakes precipitation and floodwaters 5 protect persons and property from unsafe and dangerous signs due to improper construction repair and maintenance 6 protect and enhance the visual appearance of the city as a place to live work recreate visit and drive 7 protect and enhance the quality streetscapes architecture landscaping and urban character in tualatin 8 protect and enhance property values 9 protect and enhance the citys economy 10 ensure the number height and dimensions of signs allowed adequately identifies a business or use and does not result in sign clutter 11 allow greater sign heights and dimensions for major commercial centers 12 allow only temporary signs on a property with no building 13 allow no new permanent sign or a change of face on an existing permanent sign on a property with an unoccupied building 14 allow permanent signs only on buildings or parts of buildings that are occupied 15 regulate the number height and dimensions of temporary signs 16 in the manufacturing and institutional planning districts allow permanent freestanding monument signs but not permanent freestanding pole signs 17 in the residential planning districts sign numbers heights and dimensions for dwelling units shall be restricted and for conditional uses shall be consistent with the use 18

wall or a race 21 adopt sign regulations for the mixed use commercial overlay district that are consistent with the type and high quality of developments desired in the district new sign types to be allowed are wallmounted plaques and inlaid floor signs 22 adopt sign design standards and a sign design review process for freestanding signs in commercial districts that encourage attractive and creative signage with varied design elements such as proportionally wider sign bases or pylons a mix of exterior materials that have a relationship to building architecture use of dimensional lettering and logos with halo or internal lighting and is consistent with the high quality of developments desired in commercial districts 23 in central commercial and general commercial planning districts allow permanent freestanding monument signs on arterial streets and restrict permanent freestanding pole signs to collector or local commercial street frontages 24 create an incentive for improvement of existing freestanding signs and adopt provisions allowing nonconforming freestanding signs in commercial districts to retain nonconforming sign status when structurally altered subject

board or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely

lesser degree of flood proofing than watertight or dryflood proofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except 1 conditions for variances and otherwise complies with subsections 1 and 2 general standards 8 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced

standards tdc 73d010  applicability and objectives 1 applicability the requirements of this to all new or expanded a common wall residential developments containing five or more units  b commercial developments  c industrial developments  and d institutional developments 2 objectives mixed solid waste and source separated recyclable storage areas should be designed to the maximum extent practicable to a screen elements such as garbage and recycling containers from view  b ensure storage areas are centrally located and easy to use  c meet dimensional and access requirements for haulers  d designed to mitigate the visual impacts of storage areas  e provide adequate storage for mixed solid waste and source separated recyclables  and f improve the efficiency of collection of mixed solid waste and source separated recyclables tdc 73d020  design methods an applicant required to provide mixed solid waste and source separated recyclables storage areas must comply with one of following methods 1 the minimum standards method in tdsc 73d030  2 the waste assessment method in tdc 73d040  3 the comprehensive recycling plan method in tdc 73d050  or 4 the franchised hauler review method in tdc 73d060 tdc 73d030  minimum standards method this method specifies a minimum storage area requirement based on the size and general use category of the new or expanded development this method is most appropriate when specific use of a new or expanded development is not known it provides specific dimensional standards for the minimum size of storage areas by general use category 1 the size and location of the storage areas must be indicated on the site plan requirements are based on an assumed storage area height of four feet for mixed solid waste and source separated recyclables vertical storage higher than four feet but no higher than seven feet may be used to accommodate the same volume of storage in a reduced floor space potential reduction of 43 percent of specific requirements where vertical or stacked storage is proposed submitted plans must include drawings to illustrate the layout of the storage area and dimensions for containers 2 the storage area requirement is based on uses if a building has more than one use and that use occupies 20 percent or less of the gross leasable area gla of the building the gla occupied by that use must be counted toward the floor area of the predominant uses if a building has more than one use and that use occupies more than 20 percent of the gla of the building then the storage area requirement for the whole building must be the sum of the area of each use minimum storage area requirements by use is as follows a common wall residential five to ten units must provide 50 square feet b common wall residential greater than ten units must provide 50 square feet plus an additional five square feet per unit above ten c commercial industrial and institutional developments must provide a minimum storage area of ten square feet plus i officefour square feet1000 square feet gross leasable area gla  ii retailten square feet1000 square feet gla  iii wholesalewarehousemanufacturingsix square

recyclables storage areas for multiple tenants on a single site may be combined and shared tdc 73d040  waste assessment method this method tailors the storage area size to a waste assessment and management program for the specific user of a new or expanded building it is most appropriate when the specific use of a building is known and the type and volume of mixed solid waste to be generated can be estimated 1 a waste assessment form must be obtained from the city manager the form must be used to estimate the volumes of both mixed solid waste and source separated recyclables generated 2 techniques such as a compactor or cardboard baler may be implemented to minimize the square footage of the storage area 3 the plans must identify the size and location of interior or exterior storage areas or both specialized equipment to be used and collection schedule required to accommodate the volumes of waste projected in the waste assessment 4 the application must demonstrate that the mixed solid waste and source separated recyclable volumes expected to be generated can be stored in less space than required by the minimum standards method if the application does not demonstrate that the waste assessment method requires less space the minimum standards method will be required tdc 73d050  comprehensive recycling plan method this method may be used when a comprehensive recycling plan has been developed for a specific development it is most suited to uses such as hospitals schools and industrial developments 1 the applicant must submit plans and text that show how mixed solid waste and source separated recyclables generated by the proposed development will be served under a comprehensive recycling plan 2 the application must demonstrate that the mixed solid waste and source separated recyclable volumes expected to be generated can be stored in less space than required by the minimum standards method if the application does not demonstrate that the waste assessment method requires less space the minimum standards method will be required tdc 73d060  franchised hauler review method this method can be used when there are unique conditions associated with the site use or waste stream that make compliance with any of the three other methods impracticable the objective of this method is to match a specific hauler program types of equipment frequency of collection etc to the unique characteristics of the site or development 1 the applicant must coordinate with the franchised hauler to develop a plan for storage and collection of mixed solid waste and source separated recyclables to be generated the plan must include a site plan and architectural drawings showing the size and location of storage areas required to accommodate anticipated volumes  b a letter from the franchised hauler that describes the level of service to be provided by the hauler including any special equipment and collection frequency which will keep the storage area from exceeding its capacity  and c a narrative describing how the proposed site meets one or more unique conditions i use of either of the three other methods of compliance would interfere with the use of the proposed development by reducing the productive space of the proposed development or make it impossible to comply with the minimum offstreet parking requirements of the underlying zone or ii the site is of an irregular shape or possesses steep slopes that do not allow for access by collection vehicles typically used by the franchised hauler to serve uses similar in size and scope to the proposed use or iii the proposed use will generate unique wastes that can be stacked folded or easily consolidated without the need for specialized equipment such as a compactor 2 the application must demonstrate that the mixed solid waste and source separated recyclable volumes expected to be generated can be stored in less space than required by the minimum standards method if the application does not demonstrate that the waste assessment method requires less space the minimum standards method will be required tdc 73d070  location design and access standards the following location design and access standards are applicable to all storage areas 1 location standards a the storage area for source separated recyclables may be collocated with the storage area for mixed solid waste b storage area space requirements can be satisfied with a single location or multiple locations and can combine both interior and exterior locations c exterior storage areas must i be located in central and visible locations on the site to enhance security for users  ii be located in a parking area  and iii not be located within a required front yard setback or in a yard adjacent to a public or private street 2

architectural review process and all development must be consistent with the requirements of this e020  central design district design guidelines purpose and applicability 1 purpose the central tualatin concept plan and design guidelines october 2001 were developed for the tualatin commons enhancement strategy work plan and are intended to enhance the identity of the tualatin commons area the purpose of the guidelines is to a provide prospective developers and designers with a checklist of items that must be addressed in central design district proposals  b provide the city of tualatin with an overall conceptual approach that will enable determinations on proposals that are in concert with and add to the central tualatin concept plan  and c provide the city of tualatin with a method of evaluating public and private development or redevelopment on a consistent basis 2 applicability the design guidelines apply to the central design district as shown on tdc figure 734 the design guidelines are structured into four topic areas a central tualatin concept  b city connections  c spaces and landscapes  and d buildings tdc 73e030  central design standards design guidelines all development in the central design district should strive to meet the following guidelines to the maximum extent practicable architects and developers must consider these guidelines and the provisions of tdc 1 in designing new development in central design district and must include in the architectural review application a narrative explaining how the development considered each of the design guidelines and how the guidelines are balanced consideration of the guidelines includes an evaluation of how the proposal is or is not consistent with each guideline in case of conflicts between guidelines or between guidelines and other objectives in tdc the proposal should provide a balance to the maximum extent practicable development in the central design district should be designed to 1 central tualatin concept a draw people and activity into central tualatin central tualatin is strategically situated to be both a local and regional focal point developments should lend themselves to attracting a variety of pedestrian activities at the core of central tualatin entry points into central tualatin should establish a sense of arrival b encourage further development buildings and spaces should reflect an analysis of historic and existing design principles as well as create design opportunities for new adjunct development c all seasons city building uses and exterior spaces should lend themselves to use throughout all four seasons designs should include protected spaces and pathways to enable yearround use by visitors and inhabitants d 24hoursevenday city developments should foster the idea of extended hours of use throughout the week where uses are subject to business hour operation the development should include amenities that provide for external enjoyment of buildings at all times of day e heart of a great city buildings and spaces between them should be carefully designed and crafted to reinforce each other this reinforcing design should be of high importance for buildings which front public improvements and major circulation systems f sustainable design new development should embody current green building techniques wherever possible energy efficient design options should be explored as well as alternative building products which have less impact on the local as well as world environment g buildings as good neighbors each building should be designed to fit into the evolving context of central tualatin and should contribute and enhance the public experience not only of itself but of the buildings that provide its context undesirable elements of buildings should either be screened or hidden from view h a place of multiple activities when practicable include multiple uses in building structures as well as flexibility in the use of exterior spaces i scale of the street building heights adjacent to a street edge should be at least as tall as half the width of the rightofway street trees can also be used in meeting the height goal a combination of buildings and trees are generally the best solution to create the framework of the street j pedestrian interaction buildings and exterior space should foster activity and interaction of citizens at a pedestrian scale encourage a variety of uses within walking distance for residents employees and visitors k building setbacks buildings within central tualatin must meet zoning regulations but should be encouraged to front the street edge in addition buildings placed close to side and rear property lines should be designed with sensitivity to future development on adjacent properties 2 city connections a visual linkages design interior and exterior spaces that recognize and promote visual linkages to other defining elements such as monuments civic spaces and other natural and urban landmarks that orient the user b clustering of attractors connections between major downtown attractors should be strengthened in order to create an easily walkable and friendly atmosphere reinforcement of connections could include new signage landscaping and visual cues c axial relationships and monuments recognize existing and potential axial relationships of places and buildings and incorporate in building form or in monuments extensions or terminations of these relationships d places and connections provide a safe inviting series of interconnected places both interior and exterior to the building structures provide linkages to adjacent neighborhoods for pedestrians bicycles and automobiles e transit dynamics public transit is fundamental to the future of central tualatin and its connection to the region both existing and future public transit expansion should be considered in any new development plans f driving and parking in the design of streets and parking areas functional requirements of vehicular activity should not compromise but should enhance the pedestrian environment g pedestrian opportunities integrate pedestrian circulation systems with existing and planned systems both indoor and outdoor that connect public rightsofway and spaces activities and uses utilizing furniture and landscaping that are convenient to use and in character with the public improvements h connection to the river the tualatin river and hedges creek are valuable and unique community resources development should be sensitive to the natural character of the river and creekfront provide linkages from central tualatin to these resources for pedestrian and bicycle access i green streets promote creation of green streets and surface parking areas utilizing features like permeable paving solar powered lighting and native landscaping city design standards should be flexible to allow designs that have a minimal impact on nonrenewable natural resources j connections promote design that allows for public interaction with buildings encourage pedestrian walkways elevated connections between sections of the building 3 spaces and landscapes a civic rooms development of public spaces within and around central tualatin should contribute to the formation of civic rooms within these rooms specific commercial and public uses circulation patterns public art and architectural character will be encouraged to reinforce the room and its linkage to the overall central tualatin area b areas of many functions create pathways open spaces and enclosed or sheltered public spaces to be flexible and to accommodate a number of functions whether organized or casual c the street define the street of rightofway with the building edge landscaping lighting and signing appropriate to the function of the street and the area of central tualatin it serves street trees spaced at no more than 30 feet on center is critical to establishing the character of a street d the intersections consider intersections as a room within the city maintain vehicular flow requirements while providing safe and convenient pedestrian access when possible focus the location of building entries building details street lighting and signage at intersections e courtyards and plazas in private development design courtyards and plazas that provide a continuity of experience between the inside and outside of the building and between the public and private realm f open space defined by buildings the spaces between buildings should enhance the public experience design form and organization g inside and outside ground floor activities in buildings within central tualatin should present an interesting and enticing addition to the pedestrian experience exterior walls abutting public rightsofway must have more than 50 percent of the surface in windows showcases displays art or pedestrian access elements h roofscaping the rooftops of buildings within central tualatin present an opportunity for green design and upper level activities new development should be encouraged to create ecoroofs andor opportunities for places where activity could enhance the street i street trees selection of trees along street edges should create a unifying canopy for the street trees with strong vertical shapes should be used sparingly to avoid a discontinuous or lollipop appearance j signage business identity signs while conforming to other requirements of the sign ordinance should add to the quality and character of the street signs should also relate to the buildings character and provide identity and focus for the use 4 buildings a building form singlepurpose buildings should be treated as standalone structures with style and size appropriate to use mixeduse buildings should be designed to relate contextually to the surrounding buildings in general all new development should compliment adjacent buildings b adaptable design as central tualatin evolves over time the market will dictate changes in uses and densities design of buildings should consider flexibility in use and density over the life of the building c active buildings along linkage streets where linkage streets are identified within central tualatin active uses should be developed to support them a retail corridor along the major street edges would help to reinforce the pedestrian link between focal points or attractors d solar access new development in central tualatin should be designed to provide solar access and to minimize the impact of shadows on neighboring buildings and spaces the use of upper floor setbacks and sloping roofs is encouraged e the outside wall the outside wall the buildings presentation both to passersby and to users should invite participation upper levels of buildings facing the street should incorporate decks balconies or other devices that activate the wall enclosing the street f craft of building in designing buildings recognize the craft of building as fundamental in creating appropriate building detail lasting materials are strongly encouraged and the way buildings are assembled is important to the final product and its relationship to central tualatin g building entrances building entrances should support and enhance the pedestrian oriented quality of central tualatin design entrances to give identity to buildings and uses therein h parking relationship to building parking areas are to be integrated into the building design surface parking should be limited to onehalf block areas delineate surface parking from pedestrian ways by low vertical elements such as masonry walls fences or landscaping i service areas since service access and trash holding areas are expected to be adjacent to roadways and open spaces care must be taken to avoid a backdoor appearance to the building faces adjacent to pedestrian areas and other buildings employ screening and landscaping to reduce the visual impact of service areas j interior working environment interior design of buildings in central tualatin should recognize the need for quality work environments for all its users natural lighting and ventilation should be utilized to the maximum extent possible tdc 73e040  central design standards residential uses for townhouses duplexes residential and mixed use residential developments in the central design
