balance contrary public policy such as that found by the city in this subsection 1 that would weigh against disclosure of a particular document 2 policy prior to releasing any records that are received created or maintained pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or are received created or maintained to accomplish the purpose of this chapter the records custodian will consider the intent

effective date of this title or subsequent applicable amendment thereto which has continued the same use to the present and which would not be permitted under the current terms of this title the definition under the provisions of this not apply to subchapter 235 of the city of delavan zoning natural resources protection rc287  2 continuance of a nonconforming use any nonconforming use lawfully existing upon the effective date of this title may be continued at the size and in a manner of operation existing upon such date except as specified in this legal use under the previous zoning is made nonconforming by this be considered a legal use with the granting of a conditional use permit by the common 54 council any legal use under the previous zoning map which is made nonconforming by a change to the official zoning map may apply for a zoning map amendment per  to an appropriate zoning district to be granted legal conforming use status c735  3 modification of a nonconforming use a except as permitted in b below a nonconforming use shall not be expanded or changed to another nonconforming use  unless such modification would make the nonconforming use have a more desirable effect in terms of implementing the purpose of this title as determined by the zoning administrator if such a modification occurs said use shall not be modified back to the original nonconforming use or to any other nonconforming use which does not better accomplish the purpose of this title b a nonconforming nonresidential use which is not served by public sanitary sewer andor public water may be permitted to expand without being served by public sanitary sewer andor public water if said facilities are not available within 1000 feet of the subject property and upon the granting of a conditional use permit per the requirements of 4 discontinuance of a nonconforming use when any nonconforming use of any structure or land is discontinued for a period of 12 months or is

development containing 2 or more structures containing principal land uses as listed in table  on the same lot andor any single structure on a single lot which contains 5 or more dwelling units or 2 or more nonresidential uses common examples of group developments include 6unit apartment buildings apartment complexes condominium complexes shopping centers and office centers one building office structures onebuilding commercial strip centers 4unit apartment buildings and other land uses in which each lot contains only 1 structure and where each residential building contains 4 or fewer dwelling units are not group developments even though such developments may contain parcels under common ownership 2 regulation of group developments group developments are permitted as conditional uses in all zoning districts any land use which is permitted within the applicable zoning districts is permitted to locate within a group development the land use regulations of this as well as all other applicable provisions of this title shall apply to the group development the requirements of apply to the review of proposals for group developments 3 specific development standards for group developments a all required offstreet parking spaces and access drives shall be located entirely within the boundaries of the group development b each individual land use shall have a rear or side entrance that is accessible to a loading or service drive said service drive shall have a minimum width of 26 feet said service drive shall not be part of the vehicle circulation network used by customers c the development shall contain a sufficient number of waste bins to accommodate all trash and waste generated by the land uses in a convenient manner d all development located within a group development shall be located so as to comply with the intent of this title regarding setbacks of structures and buildings from lot lines as such individual principal and accessory structures and buildings located within group developments shall be situated within building envelopes which serve to demonstrate complete compliance with said intent said building envelopes shall be depicted on the site plan required for review of group developments the use of this approach to designing group developments will also ensure the facilitation of subdividing group developments in the future if such action is so desired 4 discrimination against condominium forms of ownership it is not the intent of this nor any other provision of this title to discriminate against condominium forms of ownership in any manner which conflicts with wisconsin statutes 70327 as such the provisions of this designed to ensure that condominium forms of ownership are subject to the same standards and procedures of review and development as other physically identical forms of development 1 subchapter 233 density and intensity regulations the purpose of this subchapter is to indicate the maximum permitted density for residential projects and maximum permitted intensity for nonresidential projects of development on any given site within the jurisdiction of this title see  the development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors including but not limited to 1 the area of the site  2 the proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources  3 the zoning districts in which the site is located  4 the development options the site is developed under  and 5 the uses considered for development rationale this subchapter regulates the development potential of all property within the jurisdiction of this title this subchapter is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the city of delavan comprehensive master plan see also this title many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility of site design options which in turn results in land use inefficiencies forced site planning andor the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources the approach employed by this subchapter relying on maximum gross densities mgds and minimum green space ratios gsrs for residential development and minimum required landscape surface ratios lsrs in combination with maximum permitted floor area ratios fars for nonresidential development both in conjunction with a variety of development options available in every zoning district results in a very high degree of site design flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired community character and adopted community goals and objectives to use this subchapter this subchapter contains the standards which determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site prior to using the provisions of this subchapter to determine the development potential of a given property the guidelines provided by 1 3 should be reviewed this subchapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners the description of the process addressing residential development in 1 and 2 refers to the requirements of residential density standards the description of the process addressing nonresidential development in 1 and 3 refers to the requirements of nonresidential intensity standards 2 natural resources site evaluation 1 purpose an important goal of the city of delavan comprehensive master plan is the protection of natural resources which are sensitive to disruption caused by development andor other land use activities these resources include floodways floodway fringes floodplain conservancy areas wetlands drainageways lakeshores steep slopes and woodlands these resources are defined in subchapter 235 these resources serve important functions which are lost when these areas are subject to development andor other land use activities in the absence of correct mitigation approaches in many instances these functions cannot be provided by other natural or manmade features specific broad categories of such functions include the protection and enhancement of air surface water ground water and soil quality  habitat provision and diversification  aesthetic diversification  and buffering effects 2 mitigation in certain instances natural features can accommodate development andor other land use activities without a significant loss of their functional benefits if proper mitigation practices are employed subchapter 235 natural resource protection regulations provides detailed standards regarding permitted mitigation techniques and requirements 3 continues with the natural resources site evaluation worksheet on the following page 3 3 natural resources site evaluation

districts such as churches and schools 8 instructions for intensity and density regulations 1 for both residential and nonresidential development a check planning recommendations for the subject property 1 check comprehensive plan recommendations the citys comprehensive plan should be checked for implications related to the subject property particularly the land use and transportation plan map copies of the comprehensive plan are available from the city from time to time the comprehensive plan may be amended the citys public works department should be consulted regarding changes to the comprehensive plan which may effect the subject property or its environs 2 check official map recommendations the citys official map should be checked for proposed capital facilities and dedication requirements including schools parks stormwater management facilities and street improvements which may effect the subject property the official map is on display at the citys public works department from time to time the official map may be amended the citys public works department should be contacted regarding changes to the map which may effect the subject property or its environs b check the zoning of the subject property the potential amount and type of development any given site may contain is directly related to the zoning district in which the site is located the subject property should be identified on the citys official zoning map see  and the current zoning designation should be compared with the description of that district provided in official zoning map is on display at the citys public works department from time to time the official zoning map may be amended the zoning administrator should be contacted regarding potential changes in the official zoning map which may effect the subject property or its environs c complete a natural resources site evaluation for the site the effect of protected natural resources on the development potential of the subject property should be evaluated all resources listed in required natural resources site evaluation should be identified on the subject property located on a map or air photo of the subject property and the total area of the property in acres covered by those resources known as required resource protection area rpa should be determined as should the gross site area gsa and the net developable area nda of the subject property 3 contains a worksheet to simplify these calculations the zoning administrator should be contacted if assistance is desired in completing these calculations 2 for residential development for steps a c see 1 above d determine what types of dwelling units are permitted  of the table of land uses  should be checked to determine which types of dwelling units are permitted within the zoning district for the subject property each dwelling unit type 9 e identify the desired permitted development option  of the table of uses  should also be checked to determine which types of development options are permitted within the zoning district for the subject property each development option is described in detail in 1 the selection of a particular development option may be related to the preponderance of sensitive natural resource areas on the site or may reflect current or projected residential market conditions and the dwelling unit types they call for after the desired permitted development option is identified residential density standards should be referred to for the selected development options in the zoning districts f check minimum site area requirement against the gross site area the required minimum site area msa given in residential density standards for the development option selected in e and in the zoning district identified in b should be compared with the gross site area gsa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in step c above if the gsa is less than the msa required by the selected development option then a different development option must be selected or additional property should be acquired g determine maximum gross density permitted on the site the maximum gross density mgd given in residential density standards for the development option selected in e and the zoning district identified in b above should be noted  and used in step h below h determine the maximum number of units permitted on the site the maximum gross density mgd identified in g above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in step c above equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the subject property under the selected development option within the selected zoning district the ability to actually develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not guaranteed by the provisions of this title inefficient site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a lower number of units actually fitting on the site i check the minimum permitted lot area against table  the minimum lot area mla requirement given in residential density standards is the smallest size lot permitted within the selected development option within the selected zoning district the mla must equal or be less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit proposed for the project in step d above if the mla given in larger than the lot size requirement given in step d then a dwelling unit type with a larger lot size must be selected in which case it may be advantageous to repeat steps d i using a different dwelling unit type and a different development option 3 for nonresidential development for steps a c see 1 above a key to assist with the procedure described below 10 d determine what types of land uses are permitted the table of uses  should be checked to determine which types of land uses are permitted within the zoning district present on or proposed for the subject property a complete description of each land use is presented in e identify the desired development option number of floors nonresidential intensity standards presents a detailed listing of the development options available for nonresidential development in each zoning district each development option is based on a particular combination of maximum number of floors #f minimum landscape surface ratio lsr and maximum floor area ratio far the selection of a particular development option may be related to the presence of sensitive natural resource areas on the site or may reflect current or projected nonresidential market conditions and the types of buildings they call for f check minimum lot area requirement against gross site area present on the subject property the required minimum lot area mla given in nonresidential intensity standards for the development option selected in e and in the zoning district identified in b should be compared with the gross site area gsa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in step c above if the gsa is less than the mla required by the selected development option then additional property should be acquired in other words the gsa from c must be greater than or equal to the mla from e g check minimum landscape surface ratio requirement against the required resource protection area present on the subject property the required landscape surface ratio lsr given in nonresidential intensity standards for the development option selected in c and in the zoning district identified in b should be multiplied by the gross site area gsa used in step f above the resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space this area should be compared with the required resource protection area rpa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in step c above if the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required in the selected development option then a development option requiring more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the site in other words if the rpa from c is greater than the lsr from 5 a taller development option may permit the development of more floor area on the subject property h determine maximum floor area ratio permitted on the site the maximum floor area ratio far given in nonresidential intensity standards for the development option selected in e and the zoning district identified in b above should be noted this number will be used in step i below 11 i determine the maximum floor area permitted on the site the maximum floor area ratio far identified in h above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in step c above equals the maximum square footage of gross floor area permitted on the subject property under that development option within that zoning district the ability to actually develop this amount of floor area is not guaranteed by the provisions of this title inefficient site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a smaller amount of area actually fitting on the site j check the maximum building size requirement bn district the maximum building size mbs requirement given in nonresidential intensity standards is the largest size building permitted within the selected development option within the business neighborhood bn district the mbs must equal or be greater than the building size proposed for the project in step i above if the mbs given in smaller than the proposed building size calculated in step i above then a smaller building must be built or the use of additional buildings should be considered rationale each nonresidential zoning district permits a slight variation in maximum floor area ratio far depending upon the type of development option used as the minimum required landscape surface ratio lsr increases within each zoning district based on the development option selected the far increases this intensity incentive is based on two principles first the combinations of far and lsr requirements for the various development options within each zoning district are designed to result in a consistent community character of development within that district  second the intensity incentive is designed to compensate for potential per square foot price reductions associated with smaller fars in developments providing significant amounts of required green space the minimum lot area mla requirements for each development option within each zoning district are used to ensure that a consistency of neighborhood character within each development option is maintained and that maximum permitted floor area ratios fars are approachable if not completely attainable under efficient site design practices finally the maximum building size mbs requirements ensure that development within the business neighborhood bn district retains a neighborhood function and maintains a scale which is compatible with nearby residential development development regulations a variance for any and all requirements of this subchapter is hereby automatically granted to all developments in their configuration existing or as finally approved as of the effective date of this title however after the effective date of this title such developments shall not be permitted to enlarge expand or extend without bringing the enlargement expansion or extension into compliance with the provisions of this subchapter and unless a variance is granted by the board of zoning appeals per the requirements of the blanket variance provision of this intended to prevent the creation of certain nonconforming developments within the jurisdiction of this title the adoption of the provisions of this that developments approved prior to the adoption of this title do not encounter difficulty in transferring ownership because they would otherwise be considered nonconforming 1 subchapter 234 bulk regulations the purpose of this subchapter is to indicate the requirements for building location and bulk in both residential and nonresidential developments the provisions of this subchapter interact closely with the provisions of subchapter 233 density and intensity regulations to use this subchapter this subchapter contains the standards which determine the location and height of buildings on any given site prior to using the provisions of this subchapter to determine the potential layout of a given project the recommendations provided below should be reviewed this subchapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential projects and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners the description of the process addressing residential property in subsections 1 and 2 below refers to the requirements of residential bulk standards the description of the process addressing nonresidential property in subsections 1 and 3 below refers to the requirements of nonresidential bulk standards 1 for both residential and nonresidential development a identify the zoning district and development option to govern development of the subject property for buildable lots the official zoning map should be consulted to determine the zoning of the subject property for proposed developments the operations required in subchapter 233 should be performed in order to identify the applicable zoning district and development option a detailed stepbystep description of the recommended procedure for determining the applicable zoning district and development option b note the identified zoning district and development option applicable to the subject property the applicable zoning district and development option identified for the subject property per a above should be noted the development option for residential development determines the minimum lot area mla

environmental corridors composite maps for the city of delavan and its environs prepared by the sewrpc lakeshores are all areas within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of such features decorative water features shall not be considered navigable waters for the purposes of this meaning of lakeshores shall remain distinct from the meaning of the term as employed by the state of wisconsin statutes and the dnr 2 purpose of lakeshore protection requirements lakeshores serve to protect landwater margins from erosion due to site disruption because of regular contact with wave action currents and runoff such areas are highly susceptible to continuous and in some cases rapid erosion lakeshore protection also provides a natural vegetation buffer which serves to reduce water velocities and wave energy and filters significant amounts of waterborne pollutants and sediments lakeshores also promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin 3 determination of lakeshore boundaries general lakeshore boundaries are depicted on sheet 2 of the official zoning map upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a lakeshore depicted on the official zoning map the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of analysis shall depict the location of all lakeshore areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of 1 above 4 mandatory lakeshore protection requirements lakeshores shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in the requirements of 10 36 overlay zoning district 1 definition drainageways are nonnavigable aboveground watercourses detention basins andor their environs which are identified by the presence of one or more of the following a all areas within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a perennial stream as shown on environmental corridors composite maps for the city of delavan and its environs prepared by the sewrpc  b all areas within 50 feet of the ordinary high water mark of an intermittent stream or open channel drainageway as shown on environmental corridors composite maps for the city of delavan and its environs prepared by the sewrpc 2 purpose of drainageway protection requirements drainageways serve in the transporting of surface runoff to downstream areas as such drainageways serve to carry surface waters supplement floodplain wetland and lakeshore water storage functions in heavy storm or melt events filter waterborne pollutants and sediments promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin drainageway protection requirements preserve each of these functions as well as greatly reducing the potential for soil erosion along drainageways by protecting vegetative groundcover in areas which are susceptible to variable runoff flows and moderate to rapid water movement 3 determination of drainageway boundaries general drainageway boundaries are depicted on sheet 2 of the official zoning map upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a drainageway depicted on the official zoning map the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of analysis shall depict the location of all drainageway areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of 1 above 4 mandatory drainageway protection requirements drainageways shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in the requirements in 10 vegetation clearing to maintain drainageway functions is permitted with the written approval of the director of public works all areas designated as drainageways shall be located within a public easement or dedication for maintenance purposes to preserve proper drainage flow 37 overlay zoning district 1 definition woodlands are areas of trees whose combined canopies cover a minimum of 80% of an area of one acre or more as shown on environmental corridors composite maps for the city of delavan and its environs prepared by the sewrpc 2 purpose of woodland protection requirements woodlands provide a wide variety of environmental functions these include atmospheric benefits such as removing airborne pollutants carbon dioxide uptake oxygen production and evapotranspiration returns water quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes and velocities woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers greatly reducing runoffrelated soil erosion woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities which further reduces soil erosion finally under proper management techniques woodlands serve as regenerative fuel sources 3 determination of woodland boundaries general woodland boundaries are depicted on sheet 2 of the official zoning map upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a woodland depicted on the official zoning map the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of analysis shall depict the location of all woodland areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of 1 above 4 mandatory woodland protection requirements woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in the requirements of 10 and areas subject to the following mitigation requirements selective cutting operations are permitted as a special use in all woodland areas per the requirements of 2f clear cutting is permitted as a conditional use in all woodland areas per the requirements of 2g 38 slope overlay zoning district 1 definition steep slopes are areas which contain a gradient of 12% or greater equivalent to a 10 foot elevation change in a distance of 83 feet or less as shown on environmental corridors composite maps for delavan and its environs prepared by the sewrpc 2 purpose of steep slope protection requirements steep slopes are particularly susceptible to damage resulting from site disruption primarily related to soil erosion such damage is likely to spread to areas which were not originally disturbed such erosion reduces the productivity of the soil results in exacerbated erosion downhill and results in increased sedimentation in drainageways wetlands streams ponds and lakes beyond adversely effecting the environmental functions of these resources areas such sedimentation also increases flood hazards by reducing the flood water storage capacity of hydrological system components thus elevating the flood level of the drainage system in effected areas beyond these threats to the public safety disruption of steep slopes also increases the likelihood of slippage and slumpingunstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent properties buildings and public facilities such as roads and utilities 3 determination of steep slope boundaries general steep slope boundaries are depicted on sheet 2 of the official zoning map upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a steep slope depicted on the official zoning map the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of analysis shall depict the location of all steep slope areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of 1 above 4 mandatory steep slope protection requirements steep slopes shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in the requirements of 10 39 site analysis 1 purpose the detailed site analysis required by this subchapter is designed to provide the clear identification of permanently protected green space areas on a

topographic information is not required for any property which does not contain steep slopes as designated on sheet 2 of the official zoning map for such properties topographic information with a minimum contour interval of two feet is required c specific natural resources areas all natural resource areas which require protection under the provisions of this be accurately outlined and clearly labeled particular care as to clarity shall be taken in areas where different resource types overlap with oneanother d development pads 1 all site disruption including selective cutting proposed to occur within permanently protected natural resource areas shall be limited to development pads development pads shall be depicted on the detailed site analysis map site plans required for development permits and the recorded plat of subdivision or certified survey map 2 beyond visible damage to natural resources vegetation soil and drainage patterns site disruption activities shall not compact soil covering tree roots or otherwise damage trees beyond the area from which trees are to be removed all trees with calipers exceeding 3 inches whose canopies are located adjacent to disturbed areas which die within a period of five years following site disruption shall be replaced by the property owner with a 3 inch caliper tree of the same type canopy or understory therefore care shall be taken to ensure that equipment and actions associated with permitted site disruption activities are limited to the area in which they are permitted the use of snow fences and other barriers to outline development pads during disruption activity is strongly recommended to limit the extent of inadvertent compaction or other disturbance of earth and collision damage to vegetation intended for protection such barriers should be placed no closer to protected trees than a point on the ground directly under their outer canopy edge e mitigation areas all mitigation areas related to the provisions of this be depicted on the detailed site analysis map with notations provided which describe the mitigation techniques employed 3 required procedure for submission and review a required timing of submission the detailed site analysis map shall be submitted to the zoning administrator for initial review prior to or concurrently with the submission of the 40 preliminary plat of

described in  shall be provided in addition adequate ground cover shall be provided to stabilize the soil requirements for required reforestation 1 this that each area required to be reforested be reforested and maintained in a manner appropriate to site conditions 2 a detailed reforestation plan shall be submitted by the property owner and approved by the city prior to clear cutting this plan shall be reviewed by a reforestation consultant chosen by the city with funding for consulting services provided by the petitioner to the city rationale the provisions of this designed to ensure that reforestation efforts required as part of woodland disruption mitigation standards result in the thorough and reasonably rapid replacement of the important and varied environmental functions which woodlands provide see  requirements for bufferyards 1 purpose this the landscaping and width requirements for bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this see  a bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier it includes an area together with the combination of plantings berms and fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances these nuisances can often occur between adjacent zoning districts such nuisances are dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and incompatible land uses buildings or parking areas rationale one of zonings most important functions is the separation of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses the location of districts is supposed to provide protection but in the city of delavan this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as singlefamily residential and industrial uses were located next to one another long before the effective date of this will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses 2 required locations for bufferyards bufferyards shall be located along and within the outer perimeter of a lot wherever two different zoning districts abut one another bufferyards may be located in required setback areas in such instances the onehalf of the bufferyard requirements of this be used instead of the street frontage landscaping required in if such requirements of this greater in such instances the width of the rightofway may be counted as contributing to the width requirements for a bufferyard however the minimum width required along the street frontage by be provided in all cases bufferyard plantings or structures shall not be located on any portion of any existing dedicated or officially mapped rightofway 12 3 determination of required bufferyard the determination of bufferyard requirements is a twostaged process first the required level of bufferyard opacity is determined using table 4a opacity is a quantitativelyderived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property the required level of opacity indicated by this table is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts the provisions of this the minimum requirements for bufferyards located along zoning district boundaries a identification of required level of opacity table 4a shall be used to determine the minimum level of opacity for the required bufferyard the required level of opacity is determined by the value given in the cell of the table at which the column heading along the top row of the table representing the subject propertys zoning district intersects with the row heading along the left hand side of the table representing the adjacent propertys zoning district the value listed is the required level of opacity for the bufferyard on the subject property b identification of detailed bufferyard requirements 1 if a proposed use adjoins a parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the presence of a zoning district boundary that use shall provide a bufferyard with the level of the opacity indicated in table 4a 2 for each level of opacity listed in table 4a a wide variety of width landscaping point berm and structure combinations are possible these are listed in table 4b the requirements listed in table 4b pertain to the number of landscaping points the minimum bufferyard width and the type of berm or fencing required within every 100 feet of required bufferyard a variety of landscaping point options are available and may be mixed within distinct portions of the same bufferyard the various available landscaping point alternatives a listing of tree and shrub species which correspond the landscaping point descriptions 4 tables for required bufferyards see following pages for tables 4a and b notes for table 4a for properties zoned in the rural holding district ra35ac refer to the comprehensive master plans future land use map to determine the proposed zoning district for said property bufferyard requirements shall be taken from this proposal caution the required opacity levels listed in table 4a are generally different on either side of any given zoning district boundary 13 table 4a required bufferyard

with the purposes intended by the city of delavan common council as noted in this title and the comprehensive plan the intent of the standards and supporting definitions of this title is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts that may result from a proposed modified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this title shall proceed as follows a articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation is required rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit discussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated 28 b articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public rationale there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the title design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this title is to be prohibited c determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal rationale if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party either the adjoining landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this title similarly any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this title any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this title has the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements and exercise this power in order to protect the public d this title has been carefully designed by the common council to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan for the city of delavan great care has been taken to balance the rights of competing groups while achieving maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options persons interpreting this title should not substitute their own judgements for the legislative acts of the common council e in addition to the applicants response to the questions required by 3 above the following standards shall govern the decision on the requested interpretation on land use interpretation matters 1 no interpretation shall allow the establishment of any land use which was previously considered and rejected by the common council on an application for an amendment to the zoning the official zoning map or a previously applied for appeal from a requested interpretation 2 no interpretation shall permit a land use listed as a use permitted by right a special use or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in the zoning district of the subject property see  3 no interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject propertys zoning district see  4 no interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category see  29 5 if the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject propertys district than to a use permitted by right then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the approval of a conditional use pursuant to 6 effect of a favorable land use interpretation no interpretation finding a particular land use to be permitted or conditionally permitted in a specific zoning district shall authorize either the establishment of such use or the development construction reconstruction alteration or moving of any building or structure a favorable interpretation merely authorizes the preparation filing and

purpose of this to provide regulations which govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval or denial of proposed planned infill developments and to provide for the possible relaxation of certain development standards pertaining to the underlying standard zoning district b planned infill developments are intended to provide more incentives for infill development and redevelopment in areas of the community which are experiencing a lack of significant reinvestment furthermore planned infill developments are designed to forward both the aesthetic and economic

landscaping and parking requirements in exchange for such flexibility the planned infill development shall provide a much higher level of site design architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than normally required for other developments c planned infill developments have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this title in addition to such potential planned infill developments also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which potentially cannot be determined except with a binding site plan landscape plan and architectural plan and on a case by case basis in order to prevent this from occurring all planned infill developments are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable only to planned infill developments in addition to the general requirements of this title a public hearing process is required to review a request for a planned infill development this process shall essentially combine the process for a zoning map amendment with that required for a conditional use with several
