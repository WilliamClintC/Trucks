utilizing a per acre fee which equitably spreads the costs of the project throughout the defined geographic area on exhibits a and b 3the city further finds that because the fee is imposed and collected only at the time of connection to the project is a onetime charge is voluntary only imposed if connection is applied for and made and reflects only the actual cost of providing the service

criteria  site location and placement  deviations  construction inspections  maintenance and repair of facilities  enforcement and penalties  miscellaneous  purpose the purpose of this to minimize and prevent the discharge of pollutants from developed land into the surface waters of the city by establishing reasonable requirements for the treatment of stormwater runoff from new development and redevelopment activities thereby helping to protect and sustain the citys environmental resources   findings the governing body finds aland development and the associated increases in impervious cover can increase the quantity and nature of pollutants carried by stormwater runoff increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes aggravate stream channel erosion and sediment transport alter the hydrologic response of watersheds and degrade the ecological function of downstream water bodies bstormwater treatment facilities and requirements can minimize those impacts by reducing pollutant levels carried in stormwater runoff removing or reducing the concentrations of those pollutants that are carried reducing stream bank erosion and by restoring stormwater runoff rates and volumes to levels closer to the predevelopment hydrologic regimes   applicability no land shall be developed without full compliance with this development occurs as allowed by the following exceptions astandard

oriented development purpose the transitoriented development district is a planned district that encourages a mix of residential commercial and employment opportunities within identified bus rapid transit brt corridors commuter rail stations or other highcapacity transit areas this district encourages a mix of residential commercial and employment opportunities within transit corridors or areas served by transit this development pattern promotes transit ridership ensures access to transit and limits conflicts between vehicles pedestrians and transit operations the technique allows for a more intense and efficient use of land at increased densities for the mutual reinforcement of public investments and private development uses and development are regulated to create a more intense builtup environment oriented to pedestrians to provide a density and intensity that is transit supportive this section encourages a safe and pleasant pedestrian environment near transit stations by allowing intensive areas of shops and activities providing for amenities such as benches kiosks and outdoor cafes and limiting conflicts between vehicles and pedestrians the tod technique is restricted to areas within onehalf  mile of a transit facility this area is equivalent to a ten 10 minute walking distance because most transit users will walk only onequarter  to onehalf  of a mile to a transit facility transit influence areas require high densities on small areas of land the city finds that uses inconsistent with transit will undermine the most efficient use of limited land areas within a tod and may render the transit system unworkable accordingly the uses permitted within a tod are those that are dependent upon or which may generate a relatively high level of transit use uses that would interfere with transit use and which generate few transit trips are not permitted within a tod further the city finds and determines that minimum levels of density as set forth in this section are required to support transit ridership and that lower levels of density will not support transit ridership and will create unacceptable levels of vehicular congestion this district is consistent with the transitoriented development tod centers future land use category gateway district and regional and local transit corridors it also implements the following policies of the comprehensive plan lucc31 encourage housing near services encourage higherdensity housing development near transit services lucc32 link between transportation and land use implement land use plans and programs that

purpose the pr planned redevelopment district provides for the reuse and redevelopment of existing development in a way that is consistent with the comprehensive plan and current market trends this district is a planned zoning district that creates incentives to redevelop sites that have obsolete design or site layouts taking advantage of existing infrastructure and encouraging economic development new housing or shopping opportunities and contemporary approaches to development the pr district accomplishes this by reducing or eliminating the inflexibility that results from strict application of zoning standards that pose a barrier to redevelopment  ensuring that new development on existing sites is compatible with neighboring development  and allowing deviations from certain infrastructure or zoning standards that are appropriate for new development but that are potentially excessive or unnecessary on sites that have existing infrastructure the pr district implements the following comprehensive plan policies lucc61 targeted development encourage targeted redevelopment lucc71 high quality design encourage economically reasonable efforts toward high quality architecture urban design and site design use design guidelines as a tool for new development and redevelopment consider the desired context and character of existing neighborhoods and commercial centers lucc72 sustainable design and materials promote the use of sustainable design and materials in new development redevelopment and maintenance of property throughout the city lucc74 alternative zoning techniques consider alternative zoning techniques within  redeveloping areas to elevate the quality of urban design and encourage higher densities this may include codes that emphasize the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another and the scale and types of streets and blocks and deemphasize regulation of land use hn13 reduce impacts from redevelopment design infill and redevelopment to avoid negative impacts and ensure compatibility and appropriate transitions between land uses principle hn2 support housing  redevelopment that includes a variety of housing types and opportunities

energy and recyclable building materials  building materials with recycled content in redevelopment m23 regional transportation impacts assessed land use  redevelopment decisions should consider the effects of offsite regional traffic impacts and those land use assumptions of adjoining jurisdictions cf13 adequate public facilities when permitting additional  redevelopment the city will consider whether public facilities and services are adequate to reasonably maintain current levels of service or service standards given the impacts of such additional development or whether committed funding

welfare  minimizes those losses described in   establishes or maintains the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 federal regulations cfr 5922a3  and meets the requirements of 44 cfr 603d ksa 19101 and 192956 and kar 5444 by applying the provisions of this chapter to restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood heights or velocities  require uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities that serve those uses be provided with flood protection at the time of initial construction  protect individuals from buying lands that are unsuited for the intended development purposes due to the flood hazard  control floodplain uses such as fill dumping storage of materials structures buildings and any other work which acting alone or in combination with any other existing or future uses will cause damaging flood heights and water velocities by obstructing flows and reducing channel storage  and assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in olathe to purchase flood insurance in the federal flood insurance program afindings of fact 1the special flood hazard areas of the city of olathe kansas are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by athe cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and bthe occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages bmethods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this chapter uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps 1selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this chapter is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this chapter the base flood is the flood that is estimated to have a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto 2calculation of water surface profiles that are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood 3computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point 4delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height 5delineation of floodway fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood cgeneral provisions 1lands to which this chapter shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city of olathe kansas identified as numbered and unnumbered a zones ae ao and ah zones on the index map dated  of the flood insurance

is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study larger floods may occur on rare occasions or the flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris this chapter does not imply that areas outside the floodway and flood fringe or land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage this chapter shall not create a liability on the part of the city of olathe any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on

necessary to accomplish the renovation repair or restoration no person may seek to avoid the intent of this chapter by doing the work incrementally effective date of this this chapter refers to the effective date of this ordinance the reference includes the effective date of any amendments to the ordinance codified in this chapter if the amendment rather than the ordinance codified in this chapter as originally adopted creates a nonconforming situation nonconforming situation a situation that occurs when on the effective date of this ordinance an existing lot structure or improvement ie parking and landscaping or the use of an existing lot structure or improvement no longer conforms to one 1 or more of the regulations applicable to the zoning district in which the lot structure or improvement is located structural value the presentday cost of replacing the structure or improvement bcontinuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects 1unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this ordinance may be continued 2nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the burden is on the landowner or developer to establish entitlement to continuation of nonconforming situations or completion of nonconforming projects cextension or enlargement of nonconforming situations 1no person may cause an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if the activity results in aan increase in the total amount of space or building area devoted to a nonconforming use  or bgreater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as building setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements 2the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be one 1 time increased up to ten 10 percent and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if athese or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind  and bno violations

180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then athe property must conform to all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless subsection e2b below applies bthe planning official may approve a nonconforming situation permit to allow the property to be used without correcting the nonconforming situations if it finds that 1eliminating the nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or without moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation  and 2the permit specifies which nonconformities need not be corrected 3all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one 1 apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for one hundred eighty 180 days does not result in a loss of the right to rent the apartment or space if the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period terminates the right to maintain it 4when a structure or operation made nonconforming by the ordinance codified in this chapter is vacant or discontinued on

buildings that do not conform to the building and site standards of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be granted exceptions to those standards upon approval of an administrative review application the purpose of this section is to allow existing buildings to be expanded or enlarged in a manner that matches the existing building design and materials the additions must be compatible with surrounding properties and are subject to major and minor change requirements in a the denial of an administrative review application may be appealed to the planning commission    2017    nonconforming uses aapplicability this section applies to any nonconforming use a nonconforming use is a situation that occurs when property is used legally for a purpose and then in any manner prohibited or made unlawful by the use regulations or development and performance standards applicable to the zoning district where the property is located the term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property bgenerally 1subject to subsection c2 a nonconforming use may extend throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this ordinance was designed or arranged to accommodate the use however except as otherwise provided in a nonconforming use may not extend to additional buildings or to land outside the original building 2except as otherwise provided in a nonconforming use of open land may not extend to cover more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming however a use that involves the removal of natural materials from the land may expand to other portions of the lot where the use was established at the time it became nonconforming if aninety 90 percent or more of the earth products had already been removed on the effective date of this ordinance and bthe development and performance standards otherwise applicable to the use were complied with cchange of nonconforming use 1a change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may not be made except in accordance with subsections 2 of this section this requirement does not apply if only a sign permit is needed 2if the change in use is to a principal use that is permitted in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this title are complied with the property owner must obtain permission from the planning official to make the change after the property conforms to this title it may not revert to its nonconforming status 3if the change in use is to a principal use that is permitted in the district where the property is located and the site or development requirements cannot reasonably be complied with the change is allowed with the approval of a nonconforming situation permit submitted administrative review application athe nonconforming situation permit may be issued if the planning official finds in addition to any other findings that are required by this title that the change will not violate that all of the applicable requirements of this chapter will be complied with that are reasonably possible bcompliance with a requirement of this chapter is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or without moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation cmere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible dthis subsection does not allow an applicant to construct a building or add to an existing building if that would create additional nonconformities dabandonment if a nonconforming use is discontinued for a consecutive period of one hundred eighty 180 days or discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity then the property shall conform to all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use  compare general rules for nonconforming situation in e esinglefamily dwellings any structure used as a singlefamily dwelling and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size if the enlargement or replacement 1does not create new nonconformities and 2does not increase the extent of the existing nonconformities with respect to the zoning district regulations or complies with   nonconforming lots aapplicability 1this section applies to any undeveloped nonconforming lot a nonconforming lot is a platted lot existing on the effective date of this ordinance that does not meet the minimum width or area requirement of the zoning district in which the lot is located 2a lot is undeveloped

in the zoning district at the time of construction 3a change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished only in accordance with c blot area or dimensions where a nonconforming lot does not conform to the lot area or dimensions applicable to that zoning district said lot may be used for any permitted use in that specific zoning district provided all other requirements and regulations are met csetback nonconformity when the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements cannot be complied with then the planning official may modify the applicable setback requirements if it finds that all of the following apply 1development of the property is not reasonably possible for the use proposed without the modification development in compliance with the applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with the setback requirements however mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible  and 2the modification is necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot  and 3the property can be developed as proposed without any significant adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety dlot merger the intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein but not to require the combination when that is out of character with the neighborhood that is already developed 1if on the date this ordinance becomes effective an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one 1 or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his or her successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section 2this subsection does not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where the lot is located and within five hundred 500 feet of the lot are also nonconforming ecreation of nonconforming the subdivision of any land lot or parcel which creates

proposed change in the development regulations affecting the proposed development site could not be attributed to such person 1even though a person had actual knowledge of a proposed change in the development regulations affecting a development site the planning official may still find that the person acted in good faith if the person did not proceed with his plans in a deliberate attempt to circumvent the effects of the proposed ordinance 2for example the planning official may find that the developer did not proceed in an attempt to undermine the proposed ordinance if it determines that at the time the expenditures were made either there was considerable doubt about whether any ordinance would ultimately be passed or it was not clear that the proposed ordinance would prohibit the intended development and the developer had legitimate business reasons for making expenditures dphasing when it appears from the developers plans or otherwise that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer may complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under subsection c in addition to the matters and subject to the guidelines set forth in subsection b2 the planning official shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work 2whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed 3whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or to such a scale in anticipation
