floodplain passed 112105 appeals and variance procedures  15340 appeals and variance procedures anature of variances 1the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood regulations are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bdesignation of variance and appeal board city council does establish an appeal board which will consist of the city council cduties of variance and appeal board 1the appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter 2any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the bullitt circuit court as provided in kentucky revised statutes dappealsvariance procedures in passing upon such applications the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  5necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  6availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10expected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges econditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 1generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 3variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter 4variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of a historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure 5variances shall only be issued upon aa showing of good and sufficient cause  ba determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this chapter  and ca determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation 7the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request 8variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of  15340et seq are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance fvariance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $25 for one hundred dollars $100 of insurance coverage  and 2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the city clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the federal emergency management agency ghistoric structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see  15305 upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure

permitted in floodways uses permitted in floodways must always be those which do not endanger human life or increase flood damage by raising water heights or increasing flood velocities sound foundations and footings and adequate deviations to minimize flood damage are required for any structure allowed in the floodway and no earth fills may be permitted which would have the effect of

kind of temporary residences or structures housing farm animals permitted in floodway plain floodway plain areas are not required for the passage of floodwaters and therefore most kinds of structures can be permitted as long as they are built high enough and substantially enough to withstand the flood the following rules shall apply a no building shall be allowed in the floodway plain area unless its main floor is at least five 5 feet above the elevation of the maximum expected flood b filling of land is permitted provided that filling will not have the effect of raising flood heights elsewhere 26 c foundations and footings of all structures shall be designed to withstand flood conditions d whenever possible the site plan shall be designed so that principal buildings will be located outside of flood plains and whenever necessary floodway plain uses shall be limited to accessory buildings in any cases where uncertainty exists as to whether or not proposed foundations or

to rehabilitation and reclamation of minedout areas a all excavation shall be made either to a water producing depth such depth to be not less than five 5 feet below the water mark or shall be graded or backfilled with nonnoxious noncombustible and nonflammable solids to secure 1 that the excavated area shall not collect and permit to remain therein stagnant water  or 2 that the surface of such area which is not permanently submerged is graded or backfilled as necessary so as to reduce the peaks and depressions thereof so as to produce a gently rolling surface that will minimize erosion due to rainfall and which will be in substantial conformity to the adjoining land area b the banks of all sand and gravel excavations in a water producing excavation and to the pit bottom in a dry operation shall be sloped to the water line at a slope which will not be less than three 3 feet horizontal to one foot vertical and said banks shall be restored with vegetation in a manner set forth

the mining there from 29 f the board may impose such other reasonable conditions and restrictions as it may deem necessary for the protection of the public and to encourage the mining and processing of the sand and gravel from the authorized area g due to the inherent difficulties in reclaiming and rehabilitating areas from which stone has been quarried the board is hereby empowered in the issuance of a conditional use permit for quarrying operations to impose such reasonable standards for reclamation as may be necessary to protect the public interest without unduly restricting the
