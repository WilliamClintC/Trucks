1the purpose of this chapter is to establish a policy and procedure for managing and controlling the quantity and quality of storm water runoff wherever it may be found within the city limits the management shall include the establishment of a storm water utility to provide revenues for whatever aspects of this requirement are deemed appropriate by the council 2the storm water needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public safety health and welfare of its citizens storm water management programs and facilities result in both service and benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of grinnell in a variety of ways the service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of storm water management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the storm water systems and programs and risk of exposure 3the city presently owns and operates numerous storm water management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness of the existing storm water systems owned and operated by the city and of additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance storm water systems and facilities in grinnell in concert with the management of other water resources in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its storm water management program operating and capital investment needs 4the council finds concludes and determines that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding storm water management services in grinnell 5an equitable approach to funding storm water management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to the burden of storm water quality and quantity requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs this schedule will be adopted by resolution impervious area is the most important factor influencing storm water service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating storm water service charges 6the city may be required under federal and state mandates to provide increased quantity or quality controls to mitigate the impacts of pollutants that may be discharged from the storm water collection system therefore it is appropriate to impose a storm water user charge upon all users of property that may discharge directly or indirectly into the storm sewer system whether private or public in nature 10202  establishment of a storm water utility 1there is hereby established a storm water management utility within the city which shall be

disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare of the community bthese flood losses hazards and related adverse effects are caused by i the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flooding and ii the cumulative effect of obstructions on the floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities 3statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to protect and preserve the rights privileges and property of the city of grinnell and its residents and to preserve and improve the peace safety health welfare and comfort and convenience of its residents by minimizing those flood losses described in 2a of this chapter with provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement cprotect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for intended

shall be informed in writing of the specific reasons therefore the administrator shall not issue permits for variances except as directed by the city board of adjustment dconstruction and use to be as provided in application and plans  floodplain development permits based on the basis of approved plans and applications authorize only the use arrangement and construction set forth in such approved plans and applications and no other use arrangement or construction any use arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized shall be deemed a violation of this chapter the applicant shall

this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship variances granted must meet the following applicable standards 1variances shall only be granted upon i a showing of good and sufficient cause ii a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant and iii a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local codes or ordinances 2variances

protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this chapter the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the administrator that i the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage and ii such construction increases risks to life and property bfactors upon which the

location 7the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use 8the compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future 9the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area 10the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
