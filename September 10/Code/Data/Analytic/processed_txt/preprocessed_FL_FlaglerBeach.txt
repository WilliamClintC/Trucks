and extent of land uses in accordance with the categories densities and intensities of land uses contained in this element the current land development regulations for the city of flagler beach as with older communities encourages suburban oriented development the current zoning specifies large front setbacks low density height limitations and separation of uses the ldrs were originally established in 1981 and amended in 1987 the guidelines also build upon the citys combined use ensure consistency between the planning and regulation documents table 11 provides a brief description of the existing zoning categories found throughout the three 3 character districts the design guidelines are intended to be used as an overlay on the existing zoning categories overlay zoning is a technique that applies standards to a designated area that may cut across several different conventional or underlying zoning districts while not superseding the underlying zoning entirely the guidelines will provide the site design and building design standards for each of the current zoning subareas organization of guidelines the design guidelines are organized based on the three 3 character districts identified within the downtown master plan study area 1 downtown mixeduse district  2 downtown a1a retail corridor  3 residential neighborhoods the elements from the land development regulations identified in these design guidelines are superseded by the proposed overlay districts elements not identified in the guidelines are therefore still the controlling regulation the guidelines are organized around the following specific topic areas a area wide guidelines there are some elements that should be consistent throughout the downtown commercial and mixeduse districts the following elements will provide continuity and consistency for all new development and redevelopment projectsboth public and private notwithstanding the common elements it is understood that some flexibility and casebycase analysis will be required common elements within the downtown mixeduse district and downtown a1a retail corridor 1 streetscape design sidewalks street trees lighting signage street furniture 2 parking and vehicular circulation 3 public open space 4 service refuse and delivery design 5 landscaping 6 architectural styles b building design the intent of the

desired character and vision for downtown flagler beach the sidewalks should be landscaped where possible to provide shade and aesthetic appeal and should also include streetscape elements such as brick or concrete pavers for visual interest at crosswalk locations brick or concrete pavers should be used to emphasize the crosswalk area and to add to the visual appeal of downtown bulbouts see figure 2 intersection design should be integrated into the streetscape design when possible bulbouts are extensions built into the sidewalk at key intersections that provide rest areas for pedestrians and also shorten the crossing distance because pedestrians remain on sidewalk as far as the outer edge of cars parked on the street they have better visibility of the traffic before crossing the street and are also more visible to drivers the expansion of sidewalks and public spaces will not only improve pedestrian connectivity but will also provide public places for congregation as the physical environment is improved an increasing number of cafes and restaurants may use a portion of this space for exterior seating the intent of the streetscape design guidelines is to provide direction for improvements to the public rightofway that create a pedestrian friendly environment and enhance the identity of the area complementing the recommendations of the downtown flagler beach master plan the principal objective of the guidelines is to promote a longterm coordinated strategy that includes improvements to both the public and private realm to create a unified urban design theme that enhances the beach town character of downtown flagler beach the design guidelines for the streetscape improvements employs a combination of primary formal and secondary informal streetscapes based on a hierarchy of streets and design treatment the master plan identifies the following primary streets in the study area that have the highest priority for implementation and should incorporate formal design elements as discussed above moody boulevard flagler avenue to a1a a1a s 3rd street to n 3rd street central avenue s 3rd street to n 3rd street s 2nd street a1a to daytona avenue s 3rd street a1a to daytona avenue n 2nd street a1a to flagler avenue daytona ave s 3rd street to moody blvd illustration 3 primary formal streetscape improvements in the downtown core should include  sidewalks  street trees  street lights  signage  street furniture  stormwater drainage systems  enhanced pedestrian crosswalks the goal of the secondary streetscape improvements incorporating informal design standards is to preserve the unique beachtown character of flagler beach building on the traditional landscape features the secondary streetscape improvements will follow a phased approach based on availability of funds and includes the streets surrounding the downtown core as new development occurs opportunities to improve the pedestrian environment and aesthetics should be pursued in areas surrounding the downtown core with a gradual transition into the residential neighborhoods within the entire study area objective maintain the traditional landscape character while incorporating formal streetscape elements to invigorate the downtown core as a pedestrian oriented retail environment illustration 4 i sidewalks the pedestrian context of a street relies on the function and form of the sidewalks in terms of form a wide street with no median andor traffic calming measures create a barrier for pedestrians while crossing the major roadways given downtown flagler beachs civic recreational and commercial anchors the sidewalk network should be enhanced to create a walkable environment currently four 4 to five 5 foot sidewalks are provided along sections of the arterial corridors west side of oceanshore boulevard and both sides of moody boulevard and along the periphery of veterans park south 2nd street from a1a to central avenue and central avenue from south 2nd street to moody boulevard however in most of the other areas including the residential neighborhoods the sidewalks are not paved during the public workshops the community expressed its desire to construct sidewalks within the downtown core to create a pedestrian environment that supports local retail businesses in addition the community emphasized its desire to maintain its eclectic beach town character in the transitional and residential areas of downtown because of limited public rightsofway widths available sidewalks in downtown flagler beach have been traditionally devoid of planting stripsamenity zones separating pedestrians from traffic physical separation from traffic is important to increase pedestrian comfort and also enhances the aesthetics of an area provision of sidewalkspublic space should be required for mixeduse buildings within the downtown core as discussed in the downtown mixeduse overlay district guidelines as defined in the streetscape design section formal design elements should incorporate traditional materials in the overall design in order to create an environment that is sensitive to the traditional character of downtown flagler beach paving is an important unifying element in streetscape design using pervious paving materials such as crushed coquina stone and open paving blocks to minimize runoff and increase infiltration is preferred while resurfacing existing sidewalks porous concrete or concrete modular pavers with gapped joints that allow water to percolate should be used illustration 5 design

feet for road with no onstreet parking  where practical consider locating sidewalks on one side of the street based on the pedestrian and vehicular traffic volumes  use tree grates in retail streets to provide ample space for pedestrian circulation on the sidewalks  continue the use of traditionallocal materials when repairing or replacing sidewalks including  crushed coquina stone and pervious concrete pavers should be used for sidewalks  perforated brick pavers could be used at intersections to accentuate pedestrian crossings  the five 5 foot or ten 10 foot dimension between the row and the buildto zone shall be added to the pedestrian area of the row and should be designed as an integral part of the public streetscape design for downtown mixeduse character district  the design of the streetscape area should match and be an extension of the public row streetscape design theme paving patterns plant materials site furnishings and parking  the five 5 feet or ten 10 feet between the row and the buildto zone must be devoted entirely to pedestrian sidewalk use  sidewalks should be designed to be handicapped accessible as set forth in the americans with disabilities act ada illustration 6 ii street trees street trees provide shade buffer wind and help reduce stormwater runoff in heavy pedestrian traffic areas trees also serve as buffers between automobile traffic and pedestrians creating a more aesthetically pleasing walkable environment tree placement should respond to the local conditions and functional character of the uses on the street other factors that affect the tree planting include the volume of pedestrians sidewalk design visibility for drivers and pedestrians and the volume of vehicles considering the climatic conditions prevalent in the city of flagler beach a palette of native species that are cold and salt tolerant and wind resistant plants is recommended refer to appendix a landscape palette design guidelines  all selected trees should conform to the microclimate soils sun budget and maintenance environment in which they are planted plant materials should conform to the standards for florida no 1 or better as given in grades and standards for nursery plants current edition and state of florida department of agriculture tallahassee or equal thereto refer to appendix a for a list of appropriate native species recommended by the tcrpc downtown charrette plan  consider mature tree size before planting to ensure ample room for trees to grow tree spread should take into consideration the available planting area  use tree grates instead of planting stripstree lawns where pedestrian traffic is high to ensure wider sidewalks  existing trees and plant material in healthy condition must be protected during construction  require one 1 street tree per forty 40 linear feet or fraction thereof on the perimeter public sidewalk to include a tree grate and location approved by the city in the mixeduse and commercial areas  trees should not be placed closer than twentyfive 25 feet from the curb at intersections and street corners within the corner triangle trees must not interfere with the visibility of traffic control devices especially at intersections illustration 7 iii lighting pedestrian and street lighting play an important role in enhancing the pedestrian experience and greatly improves the quality and safety of streets and public spaces pedestrian scaled lighting design is pivotal in improving the visual character of retail oriented areas in downtown pedestrian lighting consists of fixtures less than fourteen 14 feet high and should be based on the uses on a street street lighting is equally important in creating a safe environment fdot owns and maintains street lighting on moody boulevard and a1a the intent of these guidelines is to encourage effective and innovative lighting to be incorporated as an integral component of each new public and private project the use of lighting should be integrally designed as part of the built environment and should reflect a balance for the lighting needs with the contextual ambient light level and surrounding night time characteristics of downtown flagler beach lighting should be designed from an aesthetic and contextual perspective sea turtle friendly low lights of a modest scale should be installed both in private development and public realm improvements lights should be located at the four 4 corners of an intersection and should relate to the desired overall character of the downtown refer to standards for new development land development regulations for more information design guidelines  retain the design of the existing lighting fixture  metal poles and lighting fixtures should be avoided in outdoor lighting when replacing andor installing new fixtures  lighting should be designed to minimize the illumination cast on adjacent residential areas by directing the lights towards the interior of the property andor by reducing the wattage or candle power of the lights  minimize artificial lighting illuminating along the beach such that the source of light and any reflective surfaces of the fixture should not be directly visible to the beach users  lights should not directly or indirectly illuminate the beach during the sea turtle nesting season  single luminaires should be preferred over multiple luminaires which should be considered only for gateway or entry points iv signage the aesthetic quality of a streetscape design is affected by the visual harmony of the signs as they relate to the overall architecture and functional character of the downtown signage guidelines include private business public wayfinding and regulatory signage all signs installed on buildings must conform to signs of the citys land development regulations v street furniture street furniture is an important functional component of streetscape design to complete the pedestrian environment in a commercial setting street furnishings could include a combination of seating trash receptacles tree grates bike racks and newspaper stands maintenance safety cost and comfort are primary considerations in the design and placement of street furniture street furniture may be provided when the public rightofway allows for a clear pedestrian walking zone and separate seating areas furniture should also be incorporated in parking lots public parks and plazas as part of mixeduse developments design guidelines  encourage the use of recyclable material wind and corrosion resistant street furnishings wood concrete or recycled materials are the preferred materials  ensure that pedestrian seating areas are illuminated and does not interfere with plant materials or pedestrian circulation  trash receptacles should be easily accessible for pedestrians and trash collection illustration 10 vi intersection design signalized intersections and pedestrian crosswalks are currently painted along the primary corridors in the downtown crosswalk materials and patterns could be a critical unifying element of the pedestrian environment in the downtown crosswalk pavement should contrast with the adjacent street pavement at identified locations to reduce the speed of automobile traffic and guide the pedestrians to areas where they can cross the street safely the city should work with fdot to institute traffic calming measures along a1a and moody boulevard sr 100 within the downtown area design guidelines  clear space to handle pedestrian capacities  incorporate intersection design elements including  visibility to safely negotiate crossing  legibility of all directional information  accessibility and freedom from obstructions  separation from traffic  ramps and landings  traffic calming features should be utilized where traffic data and neighborhood consensus warrants  consider raised brick crosswalk at identified intersections on a1a corridor  consider crosswalks with midblock pedestrian refuges along moody boulevard between central avenue and daytona avenue if feasible illustration 11 illustration 12 the street sections illustrated show typical conditions that should be adjusted at the major roadways and secondary streets in the downtown oceanshore boulevard a1a oceanshore boulevard or a1a serves as the primary entrance to the city of flagler beach accommodating large volumes of traffic downtown the a1a is a designated florida scenic highway providing enhanced views and access to the atlantic shoreline streetscape features should be designed to incorporate elements such as bulbouts speed tables to buffer pedestrians from traffic impacts detached sidewalks with tree grates improved beach access points onstreet parking and landscaping moody boulevard sr 100 moody boulevard connects the downtown with i95 and the bunnell and palm coast via the sr 100 intracoastal bridge currently moody boulevard lacks pedestrian character and physically bisects the northern and southern parts of the downtown streetscape treatment should emphasize welldesigned pedestrian crosswalks linking the north and south sides of the roadway this should also include landscaped medians street lighting tree planting and where possible trees defined by grates in the sidewalk central avenue central avenue is the local collector connecting the downtown with the residential neighborhoods the twolane roadway provides the main pedestrian connections to a variety of uses including public uses flagler beach museum veterans park city hall farmers market the existing streetscape exhibits a combination of formal and informal elements in certain sections including sidewalks street furniture and onstreet parking the use of similar materials extension of sidewalks landscaping and street trees will help unify the overall image of the downtown illustration 13 parking parking is the most influential element in designing an efficient automobile and pedestrian traffic circulation system during the downtown master plan public workshops the lack of convenient parking was among the primary concerns expressed by the residents and business owners a combination of onstreet parking public parking surface lots and shared parking provisions should be incorporated to address the parking demand for downtown flagler beach although the rightofway widths in the downtown are limited onstreet parking can be accommodated within most of the downtown mixeduse district and a1a commercial retail corridor without interrupting the sidewalk network the parking lane also provides another layer of separation between the pedestrian and vehicular traffic the city of flagler beach land development regulations address the parking and landscaping requirements for each zone district and use all buildings and land uses including a change expansion or renovation of a building or change in land use shall provide parking areas in accordance with the schedule of offstreet parking requirements land development regulations and landscaping land development regulations design guidelines onstreet parking  maximize onstreet parking within the public rightofway employing a combination of innovative strategies such as angled and parallel parking spaces reducing the minimum stall dimensions and establishing a minimum percentage of total spaces to be designed for small cars  use materials and textures to delineate parking spaces that reflect the traditional beach town character of the downtown crushed coquina stone and recycled timbers are the preferred materials  provide clear signage to direct traffic to onstreet parking areas and public parking lots  when possible minimize curb cuts along street frontage by providing surface parking behind buildings to increase the onstreet parking areas  parking spaces should provide clear markings to indicate where drivers should park illustration 14 design guidelines offstreet parking within the downtown mixeduse district and downtown a1a mixeduse district a combination of offstreet parking and onstreet parking in accordance with the schedule of offstreet parking requirements the combined use the downtown master plan parking plan is permitted to satisfy the parking requirements onstreet parking shall not exceed forty 40 percent of required offstreet parking location 1 onstreet parking shall be provided along the

required offstreet parking should be located on the same parcel as the uses served 4 offstreet parking shall be limited to the sides or rear of the buildings and screened from street view with appropriate perimeter landscape material per criteria for parking lots and vehicular use land development regulations no offstreet parking shall be located between a building and the adjacent street frontage 5 joint common access drives and shared parking provisions are encouraged for two 2 or more contiguous interior lots owned exclusively or under separate ownership to enhance twoway access thereby decreasing access width from fifteen 15 feet to twelve 12 feet for each lot illustration 15 parking design 1 maximum parking stall dimensions for offstreet parking and onstreet parking should include the following principles a parallel parking space eight 8 by twentytwo 22 feet long constructed of a pervious material approved by the city b sixty 60 degree or less oneway and ninety 90 degree oneway parking space should have minimum parking dimensions of eight and sixtenths 86 feet wide by twenty 20 feet long with an aisle width of eighteen 18 feet c ninety 90 degree twoway parking should have a minimum width of eight and sixtenths 86 feet by eighteen 18 feet the minimum aisle width in this case should be twentytwo 22 feet d one 1 foot continuous concrete strip to separate the adjacent parking space from the traffic way and to maintain the integrity of the asphalt edge of street pavement extending the length of the designated parallel parking strip e parking space strips separated by hardsurface material eg concrete pavers extending the full width of the parking space per city approval 3 shared parking requirements the use of shared parking shall be encouraged when the development is under the control of a single ownerdeveloper and contains commercial retail office institutional or public uses 4 parking lot design and layout as per land development regulations 5 parking should be located so that it does not break the continuity along the sidewalk vehicular circulation 1 curb cut access to property from front property line should be minimized and where possible shared parking should be encouraged 2 vehicular access should be provided where possible from side streets rear streets alleys or adjacent properties only 3 internal access drives should join together existing public streets and should line up with adjacent private drives 4 internal parking lots should connect with adjacent parking lots where possible illustration 16 public open space  provide additional pedestrian area to the major public streetscape adjacent to the property sidewalks should be provided abutting the property frontage extending the length of the property whether or not onstreet parking is required  sidewalks should be constructed per city approval and should be a minimum of six 6 feet in width  provide a pedestrian environment that complements the major public

designed to accommodate pedestrian traffic seating or other use deemed suitable by approval of the planning and architectural review board  provide visual and physical access to adjacent pedestrian areas  open space such as urban plazas and internal walkways should be encouraged connecting the a1a retail corridor and the downtown mixeduse district service refuse and delivery design location 1 service refuse and delivery areas should be located to the rear of the buildings with convenient vehicular access unless facing a singlefamily residence or the front of another building  in which case service areas shall be shielded from view of adjacent buildings 2 locate trash storage loading and truck parking so as to minimize visibility from the streetsidewalk and building entrances avoid locating service and loading areas along important view corridors and pedestrian traffic areas screening 1 all exterior trash receptacles should be screened from view 2 screen loading docks and truck parking from public view using building mass freestanding walls andor landscaping 3 ensure that all utility equipment is located sized and designed to be as inconspicuous as possible all utility runs should be located underground wherever possible illustration 17 landscaping applicability the landscape standards discussed below apply to all projects and parking lots within the downtown mixeduse district and the downtown a1a mixeduse corridor these guidelines are not applicable to the residential neighborhoods landscaping features within the overlay character districts should be designed and installed in compliance with land development regulations these guidelines are intended to supplement the citys existing codes relating to the landscaping requirements design guidelines  landscaping improvements in the area between the building and the property line abutting the public sidewalk should utilize native vegetation and plantings approved by the planning and architectural review board  street trees should be included in the planting strips in all new developments and public realm improvements refer to ii street trees  groundcovers in planting areas shall be consistent with adopted streetscape design guidelines  parking lots next to sidewalks visible from public rightofway or adjacent residential areas should be dense enough to screen from headlight glare and the movement of traffic generated by vehicles using the parking area  barriers and buffers should be designed such that they encourage internal pedestrian movement and vehicular movement between adjacent mixeduse properties  offstreet parking shall have at least ten 10 percent of the total gross parking area devoted to living landscape which includes grass ground cover plants shrubs and trees the gross parking

crossvisibility provided they are located so as not to create a traffic hazard landscaping except required grass or ground cover shall not be located closer than three 3 feet from the edge of any accessway pavement or sidewalk or walk path architectural styles this section illustrates a conceptual approach to establish minimum architectural standards for future development projects the primary goal of the design guidelines is to ensure that each individual site design architectural and streetscape project contribute to the positive image of downtown flagler beach the building elements outlined are inspired from a study of historic buildings in downtown flagler beach and should be incorporated to enhance the areas unique and authentic character the architectdeveloper is encouraged to provide innovative design solutions which may not meet the exact details of the guidelines however it is the responsibility of the architect to convince the city and the planning and architectural review board that the proposed design solutions are compatible with the traditional architectural character of the adjacent properties appropriate architectural styles while the architectural requirements do not recommend a specific design theme for buildings it is encouraged that projects proposed in the study area must select one 1 of the four 4 main architectural styles in each character district in order to assure architectural diversity and to maintain the eclectic character of the community it is recommended to incorporate a combination of architectural styles on any combination of buildings that exceed one hundred fifty 150 linear feet of frontage on a single lot or combination of lots the enforcement of which is subject to approval by the planning director and the city of flagler beach planning and architectural board the four 4 architectural styles recommended for the study area include  florida frame vernacular  key west caribbean style  bungalow style

district downtown mixeduse district the downtown mixeduse overlay character district includes all lands situated between the area defined in the map on the downtown mixeduse district boundary map the area illustrated in the map is defined by the cra boundary to the north south 5th street to the south flagler avenue to the west and properties east of central avenue half a block west of a1a form the eastern extent the downtown mixeduse district is anticipated to support a mix of active uses at street level and lowrise medium density residential uses on the upper floors new commercial only development in the downtown mixeduse district should be consistent with the architectural and site design principles established for the downtown mixeduse district goals the urban design goals for this district are 1 enhance the pedestrian scale environment while retaining the eclectic beach town character 2 develop strong linkages between the residential neighborhoods and the downtown 3 create a harmonious character that incorporates the citys historical and cultural heritage 4 provide flexible site development principles while maintaining a high level of aesthetic element 5 maintain a sense of connection with the traditional singlefamily houses while accommodating a mix of residential and beach oriented commercial uses scope the downtown mixeduse district contains varying types of lot sizes and configurations ranging from parcels fronting the arterial roads and secondary streets to interior lots and vacant lots covering the entire blocks the development proposals should be evaluated on a sitespecific level because of the variations in lot sizes and orientation and the unique conditions presented by each individual parcel the following lot configurations have been taken into consideration in the development of design guidelines for the downtown mixeduse district 1 interior fifty 50 feet by one hundred 100 feet 2 corner frontage along major arterial roads moody boulevard 4 redevelopment opportunities at block level illustration 34 uses permitted uses prohibited uses commercial uses located on the ground floor businesses or uses that emit intrusive odors or

crafts accessory seating for the consumption of food drink storage shall be limited to accessory storage of commodities sold at retail on the premises and storage shall be within a completely enclosed building restaurants as defined  no outdoor serving of food drink or the like after  pm open patio restaurants site design the intent of the site planning guidelines is to develop a system of planning criteria that would direct the future development of downtown flagler beach in a more ordered environment the guidelines aim to create an urban design framework and definition for the downtown that provides a civic and cultural quality of life for the citizens in addition the guidelines reinforce and enhance the public realm improvements within the downtown and encourage new development to provide a unified system of parking and vehicular connectivity applicability  all new development within this district should include residential uses in conjunction with permitted principal uses specified in combined use building regulations land development regulations  the commercial floor area of the uses should not exceed fifty 50 percent of the gross floor area of the buildings  the mix of uses should be limited to the same building which includes business uses limited to the first floor below the residential uses  the mixture of residential and commercial uses within the building should be designed so as to minimize to the greatest extent practical the potential detrimental influence of commercial uses on the residential uses including the location of entranceways and the use of soundproofing materials to minimize noise intervention between uses 1 building placement interior lot location 1 locate buildings to the front of the property at the sidewalks edge 2 maximize

design the built environment is vital in maintaining an areas visual integrity and unique character traditionally sized and smaller scaled buildings help to establish a pedestrian scale and also maintain the character of the downtown the guidelines discussed in this section are applicable primarily to properties located in the downtown mixeduse overlay district guidelines  all new development additions andor renovations should reflect the traditional development patterns and strive to encourage an efficient pedestrian oriented environment  new buildings should incorporate a clear division between street level and upper floors change of architectural elements materials andor color  use architectural features to accentuate the eclectic character of downtown flagler beach when possible when possible relate entries window lines awnings and canopies and sign locations to adjacent buildings  relate to adjoining residential neighborhoods with scale detail and material at the edges of the downtown mixeduse district illustration 39 i massing intent buildings that appear similar in mass and scale to other buildings in the downtown will help to maintain the unique beach town character it is important to maintain a variety of heights to create visual interest one two and threestory buildings should form the primary architectural character of the downtown with taller architectural elements located at corner buildings to emphasize the importance of intersections and create diversity in scale and character  in order to minimize the perceived size of a building step down its height toward the street neighboring structures and the rear of the lot  in order to break up the perceived mass of structure divide it into modules that are similar in size to buildings seen traditionally guideline vertical setbacks 1 front there should be a minimum setback of six 6 feet between the second and third floor of the building when possible 2 side facing a street there should be a minimum setback of six 6 feet between the second and third floor of the building when possible 3 side facing a property line between the second and third floor of the building no minimum setback is required 4 rear between the second and third floor of the building no minimum setback is required bands of composition 1 buildings should be designed to establish the following three 3 bands of vertical composition base one 1 story midsection second and third stories top roof illustration 40 ii building height building heights are identified by the number of stories above grade and is measured as the vertical distance from the finished grade at the center of the front of the building to 1 the highest point of the roof surface for a flat roof 2 to the deck line of a mansard roof 3 to the mean height level between eaves and ridge for gable hip and gambrel roofs design guidelines  building height shall not exceed thirtyfive 35 feet above the finished grade for flat roofs and mean height level between eaves and ridge for pitched gable and hipped roofs  the ground floor shall not be less than ten 10 feet from the finished floor to finished ceiling above the ground floor a story is defined as a habitable level no more than twelve 12 feet in height the additional height will count as an additional story  the proportional relationship of height and width should be consistent between adjacent structures  the height of buildings should not drastically alter the scale of the downtown illustration 41 illustration 42 iii facade guidelines guideline facade composition there should be a side setback adjacent to the property line of five 5 feet for buildings with a front facade longer than one hundred 100 feet buildings on a single lot or combination of lots shall not exceed a continuous massing longer than one hundred fifty 150 feet in order to assure architectural diversity and to maintain the eclectic character of the community no single architecture style shall be duplicated on any combination of buildings that exceed one hundred fifty 150 linear feet of frontage on a single lot or a combination of lots on the ground floor of the primary facade there shall be a minimum of two 2 breaks for every forty 40 feet of front elevation guideline relationship to existing building if a new building is to be placed adjacent to an existing taller building then the part of the new building that is closest to the existing building should be the tallest part of the new buildings elevation unless the existing building is considered obsolete or nonconforming if a new building is to be placed adjacent to an existing shorter building then the part of the new building that is closest to the existing building should be the shortest part of the new buildings elevation unless the existing building is considered obsolete or nonconforming illustration 43 iii facade guidelines guideline fenestrations blank wall guidelines walls or portions of walls where windows are not provided shall have architectural treatment wherever they face adjacent streets or adjacent residential areas at least three 3 of the following elements shall be incorporated into a design to achieve the mitigation of the visual impact of the blank wall areas  horizontal architectural banding at story breaks  horizontal siding  vertical and diagonal clapboards  projecting canopies  projecting eaves guideline fenestration ratio encourage largely transparent open and inviting facades at the lower levels ground floor of the building to accentuate pedestrian environment encourage a greater ratio of solid wall to window allowing for more variety of architectural material and elements at the upper floors approximately twentyfive 25 to forty 40 percent window to wall ratio is desirable in the facade area for each building facade area adjoining a street illustration 44 iv roofline treatment roofs should be an integral part of the architectural design and form of the buildings in the downtown a guideline overall roof design variations in rooflines should be used to add interest to and reduce the massing of buildings roof features should be in scale with building mass and should complement the character of adjoining or adjacent buildings and neighborhoods roofing material should be constructed of durable high quality materials in order to enhance the appearance and attractiveness of the community b guideline roof edge and parapet treatments for buildings with a sloping roof the roof edge or parapet should have a vertical change minimum of three 3 feet from the dominant roof design at least once per forty 40 feet on the first floor at least one 1 such change should be located on a primary facade adjacent to a collector or arterial rightofway c guideline roofline breaks for buildings adjacent to public streets there should be a minimum of two 2 roofline breaks per forty 40 feet of frontage above the first floor illustration 45 v architectural elements roof eaves the roof eaves may encroach a maximum of five 5 feet on all setback lines balconies balconies may be built six 6 feet into the front and side vertical setbacks above second floor awnings arcades and canopies awnings and canopies on the first floor may encroach five 5 feet into the setback if the bottom of the awning is ten 10 feet above the sidewalk and they

exterior materials the following materials are encouraged for exterior building construction 1 stucco 2 brick 3 concrete masonry units eg hardiplank 4 stone 5 wood clapboard siding the following materials are prohibited for exterior building construction 1 plastic siding 2 corrugated or reflective metal panels 3 smooth or ribbedfaced concrete block 4 wood sheeting chapter 4 downtown a1a retail district downtown a1a retail corridor the downtown a1a retail corridor includes all properties situated along oceanshore boulevard a1a between 9th street north and 9th street south identified as commercial uses in the future land use map the district is appropriate for lowrise mixeduse buildings that encourage street level uses several properties in this district are located seaward from the coastal construction control line cccl this unique condition limits the development of mixeduse buildings in the downtown a1a retail district and the master plan anticipates the a1a as the primary retail street for downtown flagler beach buildings have to be developed at the sidewalk edge and have transparent storefronts to enhance the pedestrian environment the following guidelines presents design principles and alternatives for physical improvements to new private development in the established retail corridor for downtown flagler beach goals the urban design goals for this district are 1 enhancing the pedestrian experience at the street level while retaining the existing beach town character with a variety of architectural styles 2 locate onsite parking to minimize visibility from the sidewalk 3 develop the ground floor level of a building to encourage pedestrian activity 4 provide guidelines for new development and renovations that reflect the traditional historic character of the downtown while establishing a more efficient land use and circulation pattern site design 1 building placement interior lot location 1 locate buildings to the front of the property at the sidewalk

existing structure street frontage should be determined by the total building frontage including the original structure 2 corner lots should apply the sixtyfive 65 percent requirement to the entire perimeter frontage provided that the build to requirement is met on the majority of any given street frontage 5 parking  parking should not be located such that it interrupts the storefront continuity along the sidewalk  onsite parking should be located behind buildings or to the side of the building when possible  encourage shared parking between adjacent uses accessed from the rear of the property on corner lots  driveways serving onsite parking should be avoided on a1a when unavoidable such driveways should have minimal width and should be clearly defined and visible to pedestrians from the sidewalk maximum amount of offstreet parking permitted for all uses in the downtown a1a retail district should conform to schedule of offstreet parking requirements for offsite parking layout and design refer to area wide guidelines vi intersection design parking design guidelines i massing intent buildings that appear similar in mass and scale to other buildings in the downtown will help to maintain the human scale of the downtowns built environment it is important to maintain a variety of heights to create visual interest one and twostoried buildings should form the primary architectural character of the downtown with taller architectural elements located at corner buildings to emphasize the importance of intersections and create diversity in scale and character a buildings scale is created by the size of the units of construction and architectural details in relationship to the human scale the size of a building or more precisely the buildings mass in relationship to open spaces windows doors porches and balconies should be compatible with other buildings in a visually related field the first and second floors should have more detail and frequency of pattern than the upper floors of a building due to the fact that these lower floors are directly adjacent to the viewers eye  in order to minimize the perceived size of a building step down its height toward the street neighboring structures and the rear of the lot  in order to break up the perceived mass of structure divide it into modules that are similar in size to buildings seen traditionally ii building height building heights are identified by the number of stories above grade and is measured as the vertical distance from the finished grade at the center of the front of the building to 1 the highest point of the roof surface for a flat roof 2 to the deck line of a mansard roof 3 to the mean height level between eaves and ridge for gable hip and gambrel roofs design guidelines  building height shall not exceed thirtyfive 35 feet above the finished grade for flat roofs and mean height level between eaves and ridge for pitched gable and hipped roofs  the ground floor shall not be less than ten 10 feet from the finished floor to finished ceiling above the ground floor a story is defined as a habitable level no more than twelve 12 feet in height the additional height will count as an additional story  the proportional relationship of height and width should be consistent between adjacent structures  the height of buildings should not drastically alter the scale of the downtown iii facade guidelines building facades play a basic role in the visual character of the primary retail district storefronts signs window displays and color are all integral elements of the design collectively improved these elements create visual order the facade should be intentionally designed to integrate storefront sign and window display space into the overall fabric of the building exterior as individual buildings stand sidebyside visual harmony is created by the similar structural components of the buildings of various styles age and appearance over the years isolated changes in facades storefronts and signs have altered their visual relationships and have contributed to the eclectic character reflected in todays commercial business district with proper design attention a buildings appearance from the street can be improved attractive individual commercial structures and signs both old and new are the basic building blocks of visual order guideline vertical setbacks 1 front between the second and third floor of the building there should be a minimum setback of six 6 feet when possible 2 side facing a street between the second and third floor of the building there should be a minimum setback of six 6 feet when possible 3 side facing a property line between the second and third floor of the building no minimum setback is required 4 rear between the second and third floor of the building no minimum setback is required bands of composition 1 buildings should be designed to establish the following three 3 bands of vertical composition base one 1 story midsection second and third stories top roof guideline facade composition buildings on a single lot or combination of lots shall not exceed a continuous massing longer than fifty 50 feet in order to assure architectural diversity and to maintain the eclectic character of the community no single architecture style shall be duplicated on any combination of buildings that exceed fifty 50 linear feet of frontage on a single lot or a combination of lots on the ground floor of the primary facade there shall be a minimum of one 1 break for every fifty 50 feet of front elevation the first floor or the primary facades of a building shall at a minimum utilize windows between the heights of three 3 feet and eight 8 feet above the walkway grade guideline ground floor composition the ground floor facade should contain a minimum of three 3 of the following facade design elements one of which must be awningscanopy 1 overhangs 2 arcade 3 raised cornice parapets over the doors 4 projected canopies 5 awningscanopies 6 projecting sill guideline fenestration ratio encourage largely transparent open and inviting facades at the lower levels ground floor of the building to accentuate pedestrian environment encourage a greater ratio of solid wall to window allowing for more variety of architectural material and elements at the upper floors approximately twentyfive 25 to forty 40 percent window to wall ratio is desirable in the facade area for each building facade area adjoining a street iv architectural elements roof eaves the roof eaves may extend five 5 feet into the building setback within the property balconies balconies may be built six 6 feet into the front and side vertical setbacks above the second floor awnings arcades and canopies awnings arcades and canopies on the first floor may extend five 5 feet into the building setback if the bottom of the awning is ten 10 feet above the sidewalk and they should be built within the buildto zone of the front and side setbacks exterior materials the following materials are encouraged for exterior building construction 1 stucco 2 brick 3 concrete masonry units eg hardiplank 4 stone 5 wood clapboard
