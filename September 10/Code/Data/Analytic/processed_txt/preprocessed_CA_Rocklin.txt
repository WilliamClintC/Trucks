parks in the city are older individuals or couples living on fixed incomes b these residents qualify as low and lower income households and typically expend more than thirty percent of their income on housingrelated expenses c nearly twothirds of the residents own their mobile homes outright having made a substantial monetary investment to live in a mobile home park d nearly all mobile home park residents own and occupy their mobile home e residents of a mobile home park have very limited mobility due to the difficulty and expense of relocating a mobile home f due to their limited incomes the large investment in their mobile homes and the immobility of mobile homes mobile home park residents generally have very limited economic bargaining power concerning rents charged for mobile home lots g there is a limited amount of alternative housing affordable to and suitable for the typical mobile home park resident h during the two years prior to enactment of mobile home rent control in the city mobile home lot rents increased substantially during the time mobile home rent control has been in effect petitions for additional substantial rent increases have been submitted indicating continued upward pressure on rents i the city is committed to providing for the development of the citys fair share of decent safe and sanitary housing affordable to all economic segments of the community j mobile home parks are a valuable resource of affordable housing for low and moderate income individuals and families k based on the citys 1988 rental survey the overall city apartment vacancy rate is 224 percent the vacancy rate in subsidized and lowerend nonsubsidized complexes is zero percent with a waiting list of up to 25 years these results indicate a shortage of affordable housing for low and moderate income individuals and families l to remedy the continued upward pressure on rents and shortage of affordable housing the council desires to encourage the development of a variety of types of housing units affordable to all economic segments of the community especially mobile home lots affordable to low and moderate income individuals and families m while rent control protects mobile home park residents from excessive and exploitive rent increases it also discourages the development of new mobile home parks and the expansion of existing parks thereby exacerbating the shortage of affordable housing in addition rent control may encourage mobile home park owners to convert existing parks to other uses and discourage adequate maintenance and services in existing parks n permanent mobile home rent control has proven to be a costly administrative burden and an inefficient city response to the affordable housing shortage o continued protection for the current residents of mobile home parks from excessive and exploitive rent increase is necessary for and consistent with the promotion of the public health safety and welfare  part 1988   purpose a the purpose of this chapter is to protect current residents of mobile home parks from excessive unreasonable or exploitive rent increases by continuing rent control protection until a voluntary vacancy occurs  to give adequate notice to future residents of the economic risks of locating in a mobile home park and the absence of rent control  to promote the development of new mobile home parks and the expansion of existing mobile home parks as a source of housing affordable to low and moderate income individuals and families  to permit mobile home park owners to receive a fair and reasonable return  to establish an efficient and speedy process to review rent increases  and to provide for an alternative dispute resolution process b to achieve the above purpose and to further the interests of justice

additional public facilities such burdens may vary by the type of land use c analysis of the current land use within the city makes it possible to estimate the burden or need for various public facilities generated by different types of land uses analysis of the land use expected at buildout of the city pursuant to the general plan makes it possible to estimate the type and amount of public facilities necessary to support that additional land use it is therefore possible to construct a fee imposed on new development which equitably spreads the burden of public facilities to development which creates the need for them it is the intent of this article to create such a fee spreading costs of public facilities to development which creates the need for such public facilities without generating any surplus to the general fund it is the further purpose of this article to implement the general plan by assuring that adequate public facilities are financed and provided to serve the

account has been established and funds appropriated and for which a proposed construction schedule has been adopted g the failure to impose the conditions and regulations of this article relating to

facilities h the city council has considered the effect of the fee imposed by this article with respect to the housing needs of the city as a whole and of the region particularly as required by the housing element of the general plan and the city council finds that this article does not unduly adversely affect the citys ability to provide for such needs i the establishment of the fee is for the

accumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damaged uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to flood losses c regulations of area of special flood hazard is necessary because of the compelling need to insure safety and availability of flood insurance to the residents of the city in that the government of the united states federal emergency management agency required these regulations to be adopted before

only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate  1252011   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter e variances shall only be issued upon a finding by the council of the following 1 a showing of good and sufficient cause  2 a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create a nuisance or conflict with existing local laws or chapters  and 3 a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship  or inconvenience aesthetic considerations or personal preferences  or problems which can be resolved means even though the alternative is more expensive or requires the parcel to be put to a use different than originally intended do not constitute exceptional hardship f any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the city engineer in the office of the placer county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the city clerk will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal emergency management agency  1252011   appeal board a the city council shall hear and decide appeals b the city council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the city engineer in the enforcement or administration of this chapter c in passing upon requests for variances the city shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges d variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance see public safety and nuisance cause fraud and victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or chapters e variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a d are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance f upon consideration of the factors of a and the purposes of this chapter the city may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter g the city clerk shall maintain the records of all appeal actions including the justification for their approval  1252011   violations deemed misdemeanor a violation of this chapter shall be a misdemeanor as the same is now or may hereafter be denied by the laws of the state  1252011 street and

which generally can be described as properties abutting rocklin road between interstate 80 and first street and properties abutting pacific street between the roseville city boundary and sierra meadows road these special circumstances are a these streets are main arterials of the city and crucial to the circulation of traffic within the entire city  b the width of these streets is greater than the width of other streets because they are main arterials  c the depth of the pavement required on these streets is greater than on other streets because they are main arterials  d the expense of installing frontage improvements along these streets is necessarily greater than along other streets because they are main arterials  and e this added expense of installing frontage improvements

council of the city of rocklin finds and determines that a the continued vitality of older commercial areas is essential to the economic wellbeing of the city and to the needs of citizens b fees project entitlement processes and development standards created primarily for the development of raw land have the unintended consequence of discouraging the improvement and renovation of older developments  especially those that consist of a single building a small commercial cluster andor undersized and underutilized lots c many of the properties located within the business attraction retention and revitalization overlay zone are characterized by structures that are sixty to one hundred plus years old small lots andor outdated development patterns as a result the strict application of the development standards found in this title effectively act to discourage the use redevelopment and enhancement of individual properties and clusters of properties within the barro zone area d providing a process for revitalization of older commercial areas focused on flexible development standards streamlined approval processes and reduced application fees will benefit the city by improving their appearance and economic vitality providing opportunities for pedestrian friendly amenities and when appropriate allowing for small scale residential development e the barro zone district currently contains a mix of residential and commercial structures and uses the creation and implementation of the barro zone creates a bridge tool for development in the barro zone district the city council finds that inclusion of both commercial and residential uses in the barro zone is consistent with and implements the rocklin general plan including the following land use goals and policies 1 goal for commercial land use to retain and renew existing commercial land uses and designate sufficient new commercial areas to meet future city needs 2 policies for commercial land use a to promote and renew as needed the pacific street rocklin road sunset boulevard and granite drive business districts in order to provide diversified business opportunities b to approve designation of sufficient commercial land to meet the future needs of the city c to ensure that adequate parking and access are included in approved commercial development plans d to avoid strip commercial land uses in newly developing areas by encouraging the village concept of grouping commercial land use in village core areas e to minimize conflicts between new commercial land uses and other land uses especially residential park and recreational uses to promote flexibility and innovation in commercial land use use of planned unit developments developer agreements specific plans and other innovative development and planning techniques f to maintain development standards and develop new standards including offsite parking provisions unique to the central commercial area of rocklin along pacific street from midas to farron streets g to encourage use of the rocklin downtown revitalization plan and design guidelines when considering projects in the area generally abutting rocklin road and pacific street from midas avenue to farron street 3 goal for residential land use to designate protect and provide land to ensure sufficient residential development to meet community needs 4 policies for existing residential land use a to protect existing residential areas from the intrusion of incompatible land uses b to preserve and enhance the quality of existing residential areas by continuing to provide highquality public services by rehabilitating useful structures and by removing substandard units c to continue programs for the prevention of blight considering all public and private resources available including enforcement of all codes neighborhood rehabilitation programs and redevelopment agency actions d to encourage active involvement by individuals and citizen organizations in maintaining and upgrading existing residential neighborhoods e to encourage preservation and adaptive reuse of significant historic structures and sites f to require that new development in or near existing residential areas be compatible with those existing neighborhoods g to promote flexibility and innovation in residential land use use of planned unit developments developer agreements specific plans mixed use projects and other innovative development and planning techniques h to maintain development standards unique to old town rocklin that encourage residential development on small lots exh b 8142012   purpose and intent this business attraction retention and revitalization overlay zone concept is an opportunity to utilize an alternative zoning tool for those properties

the provisions of this chapter it is the intent of the city council to create an overlay zone district in title 17 zoning of the rocklin municipal will provide for the following a implement a streamlined entitlement review and approval process and a reduced fee structure for infill development projects within the barro zone area  b allow for reduced infrastructure development standards and greater flexibility in the application of the citys approved design guidelines and development standards within the overlay zone in a manner grounded in market realities  c improve the appearance and economic vitality of small andor older commercial structures and developments and thereby contribute to the overall improvement of older commercial areas by making the regulatory process easier for the owners and tenants to negotiate  d create a vibrant commercial destination with an active street life that would attract travelers and commuters who use pacific street as a regional transportation corridor and where local residents have services shops and jobs  e protect preserve and maintain the integrity of the existing singlefamily residential neighborhoods immediately adjacent to the barro zone area thoughtful design techniques  f allow for the use of varying architectural design themes but require that each design is thoughtfully blended and is compatible with adjoining and adjacent development  g maintain land use and development options so as individual properties become available for development there are choices between commercial residential or mixed use projects which are appropriate for current market conditions  h encourage compatibility between residential and commercial uses in areas where residential zones directly abut commercial zones by permitting greater design flexibility across the existing boundaries of the two zones  and i encourage within the barro zone the inclusion of a public open space amenity or some form of physical interface for the pedestrian such features may include 1 formal plazas a formal plaza would be a publicly accessible open space which has a design that is influenced by classical urban planning design a formal plaza would typically include some sort of central water fountain andor symmetrical landscaping 2 urban gardens an urban garden can be located on the ground level or on upper levels of a structure urban gardens include ornamental landscaping arranged in raised or atgrade planters or planting areas potted plants and trees many times there are sculptures or other forms of public art that are included within the urban garden 3 covered colonnades colonnades are linear in design and generous in depth the intent is to provide a comfortably wide covered pathway that is adjacent to the openings of a building sometimes the second floor of a building is utilized to create the covered element of the colonnade 4 sidewalk dining sidewalk dining may occur wherever a sidewalk space is ample enough to accommodate dining furniture without impeding pedestrian access of the sidewalk sidewalk dining may be defined with a railing or planters or be open and accessible 5 pedestrian alleys and walkways a

findingspurposeobjectivesintent a the city council finds and determines that increasing employment opportunities and residential construction in the city and in placer county are projected to create a substantial increase in traffic volumes the geographical location and atmospheric conditions of the city and placer county are conducive to the formation of air pollution attributed largely to motor vehicle emissions california health and safety d as modified by the california clean air act of 198 mandates that in serious nonattainment areas such as placer county there will be no net increases in vehicular emissions by 1997 and by 199 an average vehicle ridership avr of 14 will be attained in the weekday commute period california government 3 b 3 and the placer county congestion management plan requires all jurisdictions within placer county to adopt and implement a trip reduction ordinance ridesharing among employees for hometowork trips is a simple inexpensive and effective means of reducing single occupant motor vehicle trips a reduction in such trips can be expected to result in an improvement to the regions air quality and a reduction in traffic congestion and energy consumption impacts related to the anticipated growth in new jobs and residential construction cooperation with and coordination of trip reduction programs with other cities counties and communities in the region and agencies would enhance the effectiveness of such programs b the purposes of this chapter are the following 1 reduce total vehicle emissions in placer county and south placer region by reducing the number of vehicular trips that might otherwise be generated by hometowork commuting  2 reduce traffic congestion in placer county by reducing both the number of vehicular trips and the vehicular miles traveled that might otherwise be generated by hometowork commuting  3 reduce or delay the need for major transportation facility improvements and reduce congestion by making efficient use of existing facilities  4 reduce present and future motor vehicle emissions as a contribution for complying with federal and state ambient air quality standards  5 implement measures that will work towards attainment of ambient air quality standards and compliance with congestion management program cmp requirements  6 increase the average vehicle ridership avr during the weekday commute period peak period to work towards goals set forth in the california clean air act c the fundamental objective of this chapter is to increase the average vehicle ridership avr for hometowork commuting to an average of 14 passengers per vehicle avr   14 large employment facilities or common work locations will be expected to accomplish a higher portion of this reduction than small employment centers in recognition of the greater opportunity for rideshare matches and increased viability of transit at large employment facilities d the intent of this chapter is that employers strive to reach the goal of an average vehicle ridership avr of 14 persons per vehicle within the air basin by 1999 in compliance with the california clean air act employers and property controllers are required to put forth a good faith effort to encourage employees to use alternative transportation modes methods described below  part 1993   definitions a alternative commute mode means method of traveling to and from the worksite other than by single occupant vehicle ie transit carpool vanpool bicycle walking telecommuting b average vehicle ridership avr means the average number of persons occupying each vehicle avr is calculated by multiplying the number of employees by the standard number of trips in a work week generally ten then divided by actual number of vehicular trips per work week for example if all employees drive alone to work each day the avr   10 ten employees would be expected to take ten trips each per week for a total of one hundred trips if only sixtyseven vehicular trips are taken then the avr is 14 which means that on average each vehicle is transporting 14 people to their destination the higher the avr the more people are using alternative transportation methods c carpool means a motor vehicle occupied by two or more persons traveling to and from work d common work location means single building building complex campus or work sites at common location a common work location is typified by a common private parking lot or area to be used by employees tenants customers andor other visitors to the complex notwithstanding parking slot designations such as specific
