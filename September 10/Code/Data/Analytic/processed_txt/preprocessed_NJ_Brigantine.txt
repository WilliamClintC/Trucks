an appropriate barrier to prevent future bamboo invasion a certain portions of the beachfront and strand bordering on the atlantic ocean the entire length of the oceanfront from 14th street north to the stone jetty on the north side of absecon inlet have in the past suffered severely from damage caused by storms and storm tides at which time the sea has encroached upon the land and has caused serious damage to public and private property and has endangered the safety and welfare of the public at large b the situation created along the beach by reason of such storm tides and resulting damage has been so serious that many thousands of dollars of both public and private funds have been expended for the erection of bulkheads sand fences and other devices intended to prevent encroachment by the sea c it has been clearly demonstrated that wellestablished and protected sand dunes together with berms beaches and underwater slopes of suitable configuration and of proper grade and height are a durable and effective protection against high tides and flooding and against  983 brigantine code  1012  damage by the ocean under storm conditions and are the natural protection of the coastal areas adjacent thereto and the state and its subdivisions and their inhabitants have an interest in the continued protection thereof and in the right to restore them in the event of damage or destruction d ocean and bayfront dunes are irreplaceable physical features of the natural environment possessing outstanding geological recreational scenic and protective value protection and preservation in a natural state is vital to this and succeeding generations of the citizens of the city and the state the dunes are a dynamic migrating natural phenomenon that help protect lives and property in adjacent landward areas and buffer barrier islands and barrier beach spits from the effects of major natural coastal hazards such as hurricanes storms flooding and erosion natural dune systems also help promote wide sandy beaches and provide an important habitat for wildlife species e sand dunes are vulnerable to erosion by both wind and water but primarily by wind since its attacks against the dunes are sustained for substantial and frequently recurring periods of time whereas if protected by typical berms beaches and underwater slopes the dunes are attacked by water only at infrequent intervals the best available means of protecting said dunes against wind erosion is by preventing indiscriminate trespassing construction or other acts which might destroy or damage said dunes and use of native plantings supplemented by sand fencing and other devices designated to prevent the freeblowing of sand and the maintenance of the surface tensions root accumulations normal contours and other features found in typical natural dunes f the immediate dune and beach area are not capable of rigid definition or delineation or of completely firm stabilization so that particular sites at the time free of dunes may as a result of natural forces become part of the dune area necessary for the continuation of the protection outlined above and persons purchasing or owning such property shall do so subject to the public interest therein g it is the purpose of this chapter to define the dune and shore areas so affected and establish regulations to assure their continued effectiveness and to further the following objectives 1 to protect human life and welfare 2 to preserve the natural function of the dunes 3 to minimize expenditure of public funds for erosion control projects 4 to minimize the destruction of existing beachfront structures 5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as sewer water streets etc  1012 general provisions  1012   1013

regulations  19857 purpose and intent it is the purpose of this article to define those environmentally sensitive areas such as the beaches dunes and wetlands unique to the barrier island environs of the jersey shore as well as those recreational resources created by man for his enjoyment in order to protect enhance and preserve for the general public consistent with the overall purpose and intent this article is the exercise of the power of the municipality to protect the resources of the community in the interest of the safety and welfare of the general public  19858 findings and declarations it is hereby noted as a finding of fact that the city of brigantine as a barrier island in the new jersey coastal zone is a unique environment requiring special means of maintenance protection and preservation there are three separate and distinct areas in the conservation zone each with a distinct declaration and finding of fact a dune and beach 1 certain portions of the beachfront and strand bordering on the atlantic ocean the entire length of the oceanfront from the north city boundary line to the stone jetty on the north side of the absecon inlet have in the past suffered from damage caused by storms and storm tides at which time the sea has encroached upon the land and has caused damage to both public and private property and has endangered the safety and welfare of the general public 2 the situation created along the beach by reason of such storm tides and resulting damage has been so serious that thousands of dollars of both public and private funds have been expended for the erection of bulkheads sand fences and other devices intended to prevent encroachment by the sea 3 it has been demonstrated that wellestablished and protected sand dunes together with berms beaches and underwater slopes of suitable configuration and of proper grade and height are some of the elements of a durable and effective protection against tides and flooding and against damage by the ocean under storm conditions and are the natural protection of the coastal areas adjacent thereto and the state and its subdivisions and their inhabitants have an interest in the continued protection thereof and in the need to restore them in the event of damage or destruction 4 sand dunes are vulnerable to erosion by both wind and water but primarily by wind since its attacks against the dunes are sustained for substantial and frequently recurring periods of time whereas if  19857 general provisions  19858  protected by typical berms beaches and underwater slopes the dunes are attacked by water only at infrequent intervals the best available means of protecting said dunes against wind erosion is by preventing indiscriminate trespassingconstruction or other acts oceanward of the development restriction line which might destroy or damage said dunes and use of native plantings supplemented by sand fencing and other devices designated to prevent the free blowing of sand and the maintenance of the surface tensions root accumulations normal contours and other features found in typical natural dunes 5 the immediate dune and beach areas located between the ocean and the development restriction line are not capable of rigid definition or delineation or of completely firm stabilization so that particular sites at the time free of dunes may as a result of natural forces become part of the dune area necessary for the continuation of the protection outlined above the residents of the city of brigantine must therefore be prepared to revise the development restriction line from time to time 6 the erosion of the beachfront has created a threat and danger to the property and life of persons in the city of brigantine by reason of the destruction of the sand barriers which protect the citys oceanfront on both public and private property within the city of brigantine 7 the interference with or the depletion of the beach and sand dunes tends to permit encroachment by the sea and conditions recited above make it imperative that the governing body regulate and control the removal of sand from the beach or dunes or any other interference with or depletion of the protective barrier on the oceanfront of the city of brigantine b wetlands 1 in agreement with the legislature of the state of new jersey the city of brigantine finds and declares that one of the most vital and productive areas of the barrier island system is the estuarine zone 2 this area protects the land from the force of the sea moderates the weather at the shore provides a home for waterfowl fish and shellfish and assists in absorbing sewerage discharge by the rivers of the land 3 coastal wetlands contribute to the physical stability of the coastal zone by serving as a a transitional area between the forces of the open sea and uplands areas that absorb and dissipate winddriven storm waves and storm surges b a floodwater storage area  19858 brigantine code  19858   19859 c1 conservation  beaches dunes and wetland regulations the following regulations are applicable to the c1 zone district which is comprised of the dune maintenance district dune restoration district and dune reconstruction district as shown on the maps of the brigantine dune and shoreline management plan and the wetlands c a sediment and pollution trap 4 the wetlands naturally perform the wastewater treatment process of removing phosphorous and nitrogenous water pollutants c golf course 1 one of the unique recreational and environmental assets other than the coastal environs within the city of brigantine is the golf course area established during the initial development of the island this course is the only such recreational feature on any barrier island along the new jersey shore 2 the existence of a recognized eighteenhole regulation golf course adds not only to the recreational opportunities of the residents of the city but is a vital element of the total open space available for the visual enjoyment of those residents adjoining the facility 3 such a golf course by its open and spacious nature offers a counterbalance to the residential densities of the city 4 the longrange impact of establishing and maintaining an uplands recreational facility with substantial contiguous open space is in the best interest of the residents of the city of brigantine a prohibited activities within the abovedesignated areas of the c1 district no construction of any type shall be allowed except works undertaken by the city of brigantine as approved by the division of coastal

disturbance of vegetation and soil and changes in land cover including increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes if inadequately or improperly managed this stormwater runoff can deplete groundwater resources and increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants c increases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land development and contribute to the degradation of the water resources of the city of brigantine d stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites e it is in the public interest to regulate the discharge of stormwater runoff from major development projects as defined in  2587 of this chapter as provided in this chapter in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes to maintain groundwater recharge and to control and minimize soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff 2 therefore it is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for major development and the provisions of the adopted master plan and land use ordinances of the city of brigantine  2574 general provisions  2581  b goals and techniques 1 through this chapter the city of
