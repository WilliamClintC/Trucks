telecommunications towers and structures does not have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services and does not unreasonably discriminate among functionally equivalent providers of such service  9 to create a hierarchy that influences both where new telecommunications towers and facilities are located and the types of antennas that are used and that favors colocation and city owned sites and promotes use of an antenna with the least amount of adverse visual impact  10 to encourage the location of telecommunications towers in nonresidential areas and to

define the authority of the city and its officers and employees with regard to public ownership control and management of its rightsofway the rightsofway is a valuable public resource that has required and will continue to require substantial public investment and is intended to be used by the public in travel and utilities when such use does not incommode the public 1 declaration of finding and intent the city of blue springs blue springs finds that the public streets alleys easements and other rightsofway within blue springs a are critical to the travel and transport of persons and property in the business and social life of blue springs and in the conduct of the health education and commerce of its citizens  b are intended for appropriately regulated public and private uses and must be managed and controlled consistent with that intent  c can be partially occupied by the facilities of utilities and other public service entities delivering utility and public services rendered for profit to the enhancement of the health welfare and general economic wellbeing of blue springs and its citizens  d are a unique and physically limited resource requiring proper management to maximize the efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses and to minimize the inconvenience to and negative effects upon the public from such facilities construction placement relocation and maintenance in the rightsofway  e are assets of the city of blue springs that taxpayers have spent millions of dollars to acquire and millions of dollars to improve and maintain and that when utility and similar companies and other users of the rightsofway excavate and otherwise disturb the rightsofway the city must repave reimprove repair and at times regrade the rightsofway some of this expense is paid for from the general revenue fund and some from dedicated tax sources  f some rightsofway users have failed to provide accurate information to city contractors as to the location and nature of facilities in the rightsofway or to relocate facilities prior to city projects and make demands on city contractors to pay for damages to such facilities despite a failure to properly locate ordinance identify same resulting in delays in public works projects and increased costs to the city bids from such contractors and have located facilities in such a way as to interfere with large commercial trucks using the citys rightsof way  and g passage of a rightsofway ordinance to deal in a competitively neutral fashion with telecommunications and other utility providers will have a beneficial effect on all the citizens and users of the rightsofway as competition among utilities and telecommunications providers within blue springs continues to increase due to changes in technology in federal and state law and increased demand for such services by city residents businesses educational institutions governmental officers and other public and private institutions 2 the city finds that the right to occupy portions of the rightsofway for limited times and at specific locations for the business of providing telecommunications services or utility services is a valuable economic right to use a unique public resource that has been acquired and is maintained at great expense to city and its taxpayers and the economic benefit of such rights should be shared with all the taxpayers of city 3 the city finds that while telecommunications and fiber optic facilities are in part an extension of interstate commerce their operations also involve rightsofway municipal franchising and vital business and community service which are of local concern 4 the city finds that it is in the best interest of its citizens to promote the rapid but safe development of telecommunications fiber optic and utility facilities responsive to community and public interest to assure that telecommunications and utility companies provide adequate economical and efficient service to their subscribers and to assure availability for municipal services educational and community services while not compromising the publics rights to use of the rightsofway for travel and compensation for private commercial use of the rightsofway 5 the city finds that it is in the interest of the public to establish standards for all users of the rightsofway not covered by a specific franchise agreement such as the cable operator or payment of gross receipts taxes regardless of type of service being provided that a consider compensating the city for the fair market value of the property used and reimbursement or recovery of one hundred percent 100% of ongoing costs associated with the use of such property including administrative actions as required by of the missouri constitution  springs city code ro 1996     7202015 b takes into account that a gross receipts license tax or a franchise fee is paid by some users  c encourages competition by establishing terms and conditions under which users may use valuable public property to serve the public while creating and maintaining a level playing field among similarly situated participants  d fully protects the public other rightsofway users and the city from any harm that may flow from such private commercial use of rightsofway while providing for innovative uses of technology  e protects the authority of the city in a manner consistent with federal and state law including but not limited to  rsmo and of the missouri constitution as amended 197 and as required by a prohibition on gifts or grants of property to private entities and no grant or aid to corporations of public property of the missouri constitution and as recognized by various state and federal courts  f otherwise protects the public interests in the development and use of city infrastructure including recognizing that disturbance of the rightsofway and infrastructure therein for utility and facility deployment impacts the rightsofway in a different and greater manner than other users both private and public  g minimizes physical disruption of the rightsofway for other users the city and travelers while maintaining
