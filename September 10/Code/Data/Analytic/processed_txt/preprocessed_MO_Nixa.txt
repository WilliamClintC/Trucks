ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning dimensional nonconformity means a nonconforming situation that occurs when the height size or minimum floor space of a structure or the relationship between an existing building or buildings and other buildings or lot lines does not conform to the regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived  means whenever this article refers to the effective date of this subpart the reference shall be deemed to include the effective date of any amendments to this subpart if the amendment rather than this subpart as originally adopted creates a nonconforming situation expenditure means a sum of money paid out in return for some benefit or to fulfill some obligation the term expenditure also includes binding contractual commitments to make future expenditures as well as any other substantial changes in position nonconforming lot means a lot existing at the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived and not created for the purposes of evading the restrictions of this subpart that does not meet the minimum area requirement of the district in which the lot is located nonconforming project means any structure development or undertaking that is incomplete at the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived this subpart and would be inconsistent with any regulation applicable to the district in which it is located if completed as proposed or planned nonconforming sign means a sign see section 1132 that on the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived does not conform to one or more of the regulations set forth in this subpart particularly chapter 113 signs nonconforming situation means a situation that occurs when on the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived an existing lot or structure or use of an existing lot or structure does not conform to one or more of the regulations applicable to the district in which the lot or structure is located among other possibilities a nonconforming situation may arise because a lot does not meet minimum acreage requirements because structures exceed maximum height limitations because the relationship between existing buildings and the land in such matters as density and setback requirements is not used for purposes made unlawful by this subpart nonconforming signs shall not be regarded as nonconforming situations for purposes of this article but shall be governed by the provisions of section 1135 nonconforming use means a nonconforming situation that occurs when property is used for a purpose or in a manner made unlawful by the use regulations applicable to the district in which the property is located for example a commercial office building in a residential district may be a nonconforming use the term also refers to the activity that constitutes the use made of the property for example all the activity associated with running a bakery in a residentially zoned area is a nonconforming use prior  continuation of nonconforming situations and completion of nonconforming projects a unless otherwise specifically provided in this subpart and subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in sections 101261 nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived may be continued b nonconforming projects may be completed only in accordance with the provisions of section 101266 prior  nonconforming lots a when a nonconforming lot can be used in conformance with all of the regulations applicable to the intended use except that the lot is smaller than the required minimums set forth in section 1135 then the lot may be used as proposed just as if it were conforming however no use eg a twofamily residence that requires a greater lot size than the established minimum lot size for a particular zone is permissible on a nonconforming lot b when the use proposed for a nonconforming lot is one that is conforming in all other respects but the applicable setback requirements section 117228 cannot reasonably be complied with then the entity authorized by this subpart to issue a permit for the proposed use the city planner or the city council may allow deviations from the applicable setback requirements if it finds that 1 the proposed property cannot reasonably be developed for the use proposed without such deviations  2 these deviations are necessitated by the size or shape of the nonconforming lot  and 3 the property can be developed as proposed without any significantly adverse impact on surrounding properties or the public health or safety c for purposes of subsection b of this section compliance with applicable building setback requirements is not reasonably possible if a building that serves the minimal needs of the use proposed for the nonconforming lot cannot practicably be constructed and located on the lot in conformity with such setback requirements however mere financial hardship does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible d this section applies only to undeveloped nonconforming lots a lot is undeveloped if it has no substantial structures upon it a change in use of a developed nonconforming lot may be accomplished in accordance with section 101264 e subject to the following sentence if on the date this section becomes effective an undeveloped nonconforming lot adjoins and has continuous frontage with one or more other undeveloped lots under the same ownership then neither the owner of the nonconforming lot nor his successors in interest may take advantage of the provisions of this section this subsection shall not apply to a nonconforming lot if a majority of the developed lots located on either side of the street where such lot is located and within 500 feet of such lot are also nonconforming the intent of this subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other undeveloped lots to create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein but not to require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the neighborhood has previously been developed prior  extension or enlargement of nonconforming situations a except as specifically provided in this section no person may engage in an activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation in particular physical alteration of structures or the placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if such activity results in 1 an increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use  or 2 greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements height limitations or density requirements or other requirements such as parking requirements b subject to subsection d of this section a nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a completed building that when the use was made nonconforming by this subpart was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use however subject to section 101266 authorizing the completion of nonconforming projects in certain circumstances a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building c the volume intensity or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount to only changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other subsections of this section occur d notwithstanding subsection a of this section any structure used for singlefamily residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size so long as the enlargement or replacement does not create new nonconformities or increase the extent of existing nonconformities with respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements this subsection is subject to the limitations stated in section 101265 abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations e notwithstanding subsection a of this section whenever there exists a lot with one or more structures on it  and a change in use that does not involve any enlargement of a structure is proposed for such lot  and the parking or loading requirements of chapter 111 article v that would be applicable as a result of the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading then the proposed change cannot be satisfied on such lot because there is not sufficient area available on the lot that can practicably be used for parking or loading then the proposed use shall not be regarded as resulting in an impermissible extension or enlargement of a nonconforming situation however the applicant shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading requirements that can be satisfied without additional land and shall also be required to obtain satellite parking in accordance with section 111208 1 parking requirements cannot be satisfied on the lot with respect to which the permit is required  and 2 such satellite parking is reasonably available if such satellite parking is not reasonably available at the time the zoning or special or preliminary plat approval is granted then the permit recipient shall be required to obtain it if and when it becomes reasonably available this requirement shall be a continuing condition of the permit prior  repair maintenance and reconstruction a minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged major renovation ie work estimated to cost more than 25 percent of the appraised valuation of the structure to be renovated may be done only in accordance with an approved use permit issued pursuant to this section b if a structure located on a lot where a nonconforming situation exists is damaged to an extent that the costs of repair or replacement would exceed 25 percent of the appraised valuation of the damaged structure then the damaged structure may be repaired or replaced only in accordance with an approved use permit issued pursuant to this section this subsection does not apply to structures used for singlefamily residential purposes which structures may be reconstructed pursuant to an approved use permit just as they may be enlarged or replaced as provided in section 101262d c for purposes of subsections a and b of this section 1 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the fair market value of the materials and services necessary to accomplish such renovation repair or replacement 2 the cost of renovation or repair or replacement shall mean the total cost of all such intended work and no person may seek to avoid the intent of subsection a or b of this section by doing such work incrementally 3 the appraised valuation shall mean either the appraised valuation for property tax purposes updated as necessary by the increase in the consumer price index since the date of the land valuation or the valuation determined by a professionally recognized property appraiser d the city planner shall issue a permit authorized by this section if he finds that in completing the renovation repair or replacement work 1 no violation of section 101262 will occur  and 2 the permittee will comply to the extent reasonably possible with all provisions of this subpart applicable to the existing use except that the permittee shall not lose his right to continue a nonconforming use e compliance with a requirement of this subpart is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible prior  change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists a a change in use of property where a nonconforming situation exists that is sufficiently substantial to require a new approved use specialuse or preliminary plat approval in accordance with section 101127 may not be made except in accordance with subsections b d of this section however this requirement shall not apply if only a sign permit is needed b if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located and all of the other requirements of this subpart applicable to that use can be complied with permission to make the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot once conformity with this subpart is achieved the property may not revert to its nonconforming status c if the intended change in use is to a principal use that is permissible in the district where the property is located but all of the requirements of this subpart applicable to that use cannot reasonably be complied with then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this subpart to issue a permit for that particular use the city planner or city council issues a permit authorizing the change this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds in addition to any other findings that may be required by this subpart that 1 the intended change will not result in a violation of section 101262  and 2 all of the applicable requirements of this subpart that can reasonably be complied with will be complied with compliance with a requirement of this subpart is not reasonably possible if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation mere financial hardship caused by the cost of meeting such requirements as paved parking does not constitute grounds for finding that compliance is not reasonably possible and in no case may an applicant be given permission pursuant to this subsection to construct a building or add to an existing building if additional nonconformities would thereby be created d if the intended change in use is to another principal use that is also nonconforming then the change is permissible if the entity authorized by this subpart to issue a permit for that particular use city planner or city council issues a permit authorizing the change the permitissuing authority may issue the permit if it finds in addition to other findings that may be required by this subpart that 1 the use requested is one that is permissible in some zoning district with either an approved use specialuse or preliminary plat approval  2 all of the conditions applicable to the permit authorized in subsection c of this section are satisfied  and 3 the proposed development will have less of an adverse impact on those most affected by it and will be more compatible with the surrounding neighborhood than the use in operation at the time the permit is applied for prior  abandonment and discontinuance of nonconforming situations a when a nonconforming use is 1 discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days  or 2 discontinued for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use  the property involved may thereafter be used only for conforming purposes when a residential property is being actively marketed for tenants to continue the use the use is not deemed to have stopped b if the principal activity on property where a nonconforming situation other than a nonconforming use exists is 1 discontinued for a consecutive period of 180 days  or 2 discontinued for any period of time without a present intention of resuming that activity  then that property may thereafter be used only in conformity with all of the regulations applicable to the preexisting use unless the entity with authority to issue a permit for the intended use issues a permit to allow the property to be used for this purpose without correcting the nonconforming situations this permit may be issued if the permitissuing authority finds that eliminating a particular nonconformity is not reasonably possible ie cannot be accomplished without adding additional land to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is on a permanent foundation the permit shall specify which nonconformities need not be corrected c for purposes of determining whether a right to continue a nonconforming situation is lost pursuant to this section all of the buildings activities and operations maintained on a lot are generally to be considered as a whole for example the failure to rent one apartment in a nonconforming apartment building for 180 days shall not result in a loss of the right to rent that apartment or space thereafter so long as the apartment building as a whole is continuously maintained but if a nonconforming use is maintained in conjunction with a conforming use discontinuance of a nonconforming use for the required period shall terminate the right to maintain it thereafter d when a structure or operation made nonconforming by this chapter is vacant or discontinued at the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived the 180day period for purposes of this section begins to run on the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived prior    completion of nonconforming projects a all nonconforming projects approved before the effective date of the ordinance from which this subpart is derived can be continued if a development is designed to be completed in stages this subsection shall apply only to the particular phase under construction b when it appears from the developers plans that a project was intended to be or reasonably could be completed in phases stages segments or other discrete units the developer shall be allowed to complete only those phases or segments with respect to which the developer can make the showing required under this subsection the permitissuing authority shall in determining whether a developer would be unreasonably prejudiced if not allowed to complete phases or segments of a nonconforming project consider the following in addition to other relevant factors 1 whether any plans prepared or approved regarding uncompleted phases constitute conceptual plans only or construction drawings based upon detailed surveying architectural or engineering work 2 whether any improvements such as streets or utilities have been installed in phases not yet completed 3 whether utilities and other facilities installed in completed phases have been constructed in such a manner or location or with approved but uncompleted phases that the investment in such utilities or other facilities cannot be recouped if such approved but uncompleted phases are constructed in conformity with existing regulations prior  secs 101267101295  reserved article viii  amendments

the need for screening requirements the city council finds that 1 screening between two lots lessens the transmission from one lot to another of noise dust and glare 2 screening can lessen the visual pollution that may otherwise occur within an urbanized area even minimal screening can provide an impression of separation of spaces and more extensive screening can shield entirely one use from the visual assault of an adjacent use 3 screening can establish a greater sense of privacy from visual or physical intrusion the degree of privacy varying with the intensity of the screening 4 the

trees are proven producers of oxygen a necessary element for human survival  2 trees appreciably reduce the ever increasing environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide content of the air and play a vital role in purifying the air we breath  3 trees transpire considerable amounts of water each day and thereby purify the air much like the airwasher devices used on commercial air conditioning systems  4 trees have an important role in neutralizing wastewater passing ground from the surface to groundwater tables and lower aquifers  5 trees root systems stabilize the groundwater tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation erosion control and flood control  6 trees are an invaluable physical aesthetic and psychological counterpoint to the urban setting making urban life more comfortable by providing shade and cooling the air and land reducing noise levels and glare and breaking the monotony of human developments on the land particularly parking areas  and 7 for the reasons indicated in subsection a6 trees have an important impact on the desirability of land and therefore on property values b based upon the findings set forth in subsection a of this section the city council declares that it is not only desirable but essential to the health safety and welfare of all persons living or working within the city limits to protect certain existing trees and under the circumstances set forth in this article to require the planting of new trees in certain types of developments prior  retention and protection of large trees a every development shall retain all existing trees 18 inches in diameter or more unless the retention of such trees would unreasonably burden the development b no excavation or other subsurface disturbance may be undertaken within the drip line of any tree 18 inches in diameter or more and no impervious surface including but not limited to paving or buildings may be located within 12 feet measured from the centerline of the trunk of any tree 18 inches in diameter or more unless compliance with this subsection would unreasonably burden the development for purposes of this subsection a drip line is defined as a perimeter formed by the points farthest away from the trunk of a tree where precipitation falling from the branches of that tree lands on the ground c the retention or protection of trees 18 inches in diameter or more as provided in subsection a and b of this section unreasonably burdens a development if to accomplish such retention or protection the desired location of improvements on a lot or the proposed activities on a lot would have to be substantially altered and such alteration would work an unreasonable hardship upon the developer d if space that would otherwise be devoted to parking cannot be so used because of the requirements of subsection a or b of this section and as a result the parking requirements set forth in article v of chapter 111 cannot be satisfied the number of required spaces

access is unclear the city shall apply the following criteria to a particular situation to determine if a proposed accessway shall be a public street or private driveway 1 driveways are generally non  they are not to provide easy convenient connection between streets that encourages use by the general public 2 driveways generally serve one lot not several lots capable of being held in separate ownership accessways that provide the only or the primary access from the street to a use by crossing other lots can require public access public access is better served via a public street 3 public services are generally provided on streets not private drives in a situation where a driveways design makes it difficult for the city to provide its services in a standard fashion or makes it difficult for residents to utilize the standard public services and where the difficulty can be eliminated by utilizing a street instead of a driveway a street is appropriate 4 unless the city determines that it is in the best interest of the city to do otherwise the publicly owned and maintained portions of the water and sewer systems are constructed within the street row  instillation of

be served by the street may be used as a good indicator of the number of trips but is not always conclusive  3 whenever a subdivision street continues an existing street that formerly terminated outside the subdivision or it is expected that a subdivision street will be continued beyond the subdivision at some future time the classification of the street will be based upon the street in its entirety both within and outside of the subdivision b the classification of streets shall be as follows 1 local a street primarily providing direct access to abutting properties and designed to accommodate low volume lowspeed traffic the design service volume for local streets is less than 1500 vehicles per day with a design speed of 30 mph 2 collectors a street which collects and distributes traffic between arterial streets and local streets and is primarily intended to proved for lowtomoderate volume lowspeed and short length trips while also providing access to abutting properties the design service volume for collector streets is 1500 to 8000 vehicles per day with a design speed of 30 mph 3 secondary arterial a street which collects and distributes traffic between arterial streets and local streets and is primarily intended to provide for lowto moderate volume lowspeed an short length trips while also providing access to abutting properties the design service volume for collector streets is 1500 to 8000 vehicles per day with a design speed of 30 mph 4 primary arterial a street primarily intended to provide for hightomoderate volume moderatespeed traffic movement between major activity centers access to abutting property is subordinate to traffic flow and is subject to the necessary control of entrances and exits the design service volume for primary arterial streets is 10000 to 30000 vehicles per day with a design speed of 35 to 45 mph 5 expressway a street primarily intended to provide partial access control and high priority for traffic flow with atgrade signalized intersections for major streets intended for highvolume moderatetohigh speed traffic movement across the metropolitan area with minimal access to adjacent land may be designed as a highway with separation for adjacent land uses or as a street with controlled access to adjacent land uses service access should be provided from lower order streets the design service volume for expressways is 20000 to 50000 vehicles per day with a design speed of 30 to 55 mph prior  access to lots every lot shall have access to it that is sufficient to afford a reasonable means of ingress and egress for emergency vehicles as well as for all those likely to need or desire access to the property in its intended use prior  access to arterial streets whenever a major subdivision that involves the creation of one or more new streets borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial street no direct driveway access may be provided from the lots within this subdivision onto this street prior  entrances to streets a all driveway entrances and other openings onto streets within the citys planning jurisdiction shall be constructed so that 1 vehicles can enter and exit from the lot in question without posing any substantial danger to themselves pedestrians or vehicles traveling in abutting streets  and 2 interference with the free and convenient flow of traffic in abutting or surrounding streets is minimized b specifications for driveway entrances are set forth in the city technical specifications manual if driveway entrances and other openings onto streets are constructed in accordance with the foregoing specifications and requirements this shall be deemed prima facie evidence of compliance with the standard set forth in subsection a of this section c for purposes of this section the term prima facie evidence means that the permitissuing authority may but is not required to conclude from this evidence alone that the proposed development complies with subsection a of this section prior  coordination with surrounding streets a the street system of a subdivision shall be coordinated with existing proposed and anticipated streets outside the subdivision or outside the portion of a single tract that is being divided into lots hereinafter surrounding streets as provided in this section b collector streets shall interest with surrounding collector or arterial streets at safe and convenient locations c local streets shall connect with surrounding streets where necessary to permit the convenient movement of traffic between residential neighborhoods or to facilitate access to neighborhoods by emergency service vehicles or for other sufficient reasons but connections shall not be permitted where the effect would be to encourage the use of such streets by substantial d whenever connections to anticipated or proposed surrounding streets are required by this section the street rightofway shall be extended and the street developed to the property line of the subdivided property or to the edge of the remaining undeveloped portion of a single tract at the point where the connection to the anticipated or proposed street is expected in addition the permitissuing authority may require temporary turnarounds to be constructed at the end of such streets pending their extension when such turnarounds appear necessary to facilitate the flow of traffic or accommodate emergency vehicles notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection no temporary deadend street in excess of 1000 feet may be created unless no other practicable alternative is available prior  relationship of street to topography a streets shall be related appropriately to the topography in particular streets shall be designed to facilitate

unless no other practicable alternative is available however in no case may streets be constructed with grades that in the professional opinion of the public works director create a substantial danger to the public safety prior  street width sidewalk and drainage requirements in subdivisions a street rightsofway are designed and developed to serve several functions 1 to carry motor vehicle traffic and in some cases allow onstreet parking  2 to provide a safe and convenient passageway for pedestrian traffic  and 3 to serve as an important link in the towns drainage system in order to fulfill these objectives all public streets shall be constructed to meet either the standards set forth in subsection a2 or 3 of this section b all streets shall be constructed with curb and gutter and shall conform to the other requirements of this subsection only standard 90degree curb may be used except that rolltype curb shall be permitted along minor and local streets within residential subdivisions street pavement width shall be measured from curb face to curb face where 90degree curb is used and from the center of the curb where rolltype curb is used local street designations shall have a minimum street width of 27 feet from back of curb to back of curb with parking allowed on one side of the street only local streets requesting parking on both sided of the street shall maintain a

this section shall be at least four feet in width except that the permitissuing authority may permit the installation of walkways constructed with other suitable materials when it concludes that 1 such walkways would serve the residents of the development as adequately as concrete sidewalks  and 2 such walkways would be more environmentally desirable or more in keeping with the overall design of the development d whenever the permitissuing authority finds that a means of pedestrian access is necessary from the subdivision to schools parks playgrounds or other roads or facilities and that such access is not conveniently provided by sidewalks adjacent to the streets the developer may be required to reserve an unobstructed easement of at least ten feet in width to provide such access prior  general layout of streets a local streets in residential areas shall be curved whenever practicable to the extent necessary to avoid conformity of lot appearance b culdesacs and loop streets are encouraged so that on residential streets is minimized similarly to the extent practicable driveway access to collector streets shall be minimized to facilitate the free flow of traffic and avoid traffic hazards c all permanent deadend streets as opposed to temporary deadend streets see section 115166d shall be developed as culdesacs in accordance with the standards set forth in subsection d of this section except where no other practical alternative is available such streets may not extend more than 550 feet measured to the center of the turnaround d the rightofway of a culdesac shall have a radius of 50 feet the radius of the paved portion of the turnaround measured to the outer edge of the pavement shall be 40 feet and the pavement width shall be 12 feet without curb and gutter

street as well as a street created by the subdivider that meets the public street standards of this chapter and is dedicated for public use unless the recorded plat of a subdivision clearly shows a street to be private the recording of such a plat shall constitute an offer of dedication of such street b a subdivision in which the access requirement of section 115163 is satisfied by a private road that meets neither the public street standards nor the standards set forth in section 115163 may be developed so long as since the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived not more than three lots have been created out of that same tract 1 the intent of this subsection is primarily to allow the creation of not more than three lots developed for singlefamily residential purposes therefore the permitissuing authority may not approve any subdivision served by a private road authorized by this subsection in which one or more of the lots thereby created is intended for a twofamily or multifamily residential use  or b any other residential or nonresidential use that would tend to generate more traffic than that customarily generated by three singlefamily residences 2 to ensure that the intent of this subsection is not subverted the permitissuing authority may among other possible options require that the approved plans show the types and locations of buildings on each lot or that the lots in a residential subdivision served by a private road be smaller than the permissible size of lots on which twofamily or multifamily developments could be located or that restrictive covenants limiting the use of the subdivided property in accordance with this section be recorded before final approval c no final plat that shows lots served by private roads may be recorded unless the final plat contains the following notations 1 further subdivision of any lot shown on this plat as served by a private road may be prohibited by the city of nixa land

of approved uses section 11799 the letter x means that the use meets the requirements of the zoning district and is approved by being eligible for a building permit issued by the development department the letter s means a specialuse permit must be obtained from the city council prior  city council jurisdiction over use otherwise approved with an approved use permit a notwithstanding any other provisions of this article whenever the table of approved uses interpreted in the light of section 11791 and the other provisions of this article provides that a use in a nonresidential zone or a nonconforming use in a residential zone is permitted with an approved use permit a specialuse permit shall nevertheless be required if the city planner finds that the proposed use would have an extraordinary impact on neighboring properties or the general public b in making this determination the city planner shall consider among other factors whether 1 the use is proposed for an undeveloped or previously developed lot  2 whether the proposed use constitutes a change from one principal use classification to another  3 whether the use proposed for a site that poses peculiar traffic or other hazards or difficulties  and 4 whether the proposed use is substantially unique or is likely to have impacts that differ substantially from those presented by other uses that are approved on the zoning district in question c the specialuse permit request must be heard and determined by the city council in a regularly scheduled meeting prior  approved uses and specific exclusions a the presumption established by this chapter is that all legitimate uses of land are approved within at least one zoning district in the city limits therefore because the list of approved uses set for in section 11799 table of approved uses cannot be all inclusive those uses that are listed shall be interpreted liberally to include other uses that have similar impacts to the listed uses b notwithstanding subsection a of this section all uses that are not listed in section 11790 table of approved uses even given the liberal interpretation mandated by subsection a of this section are prohibited nor shall section 11799 table of approved uses be interpreted to allow a use in one zoning district when the use in question is more closely related to another specified use that is

table is conducted in conjunction with another principal use and the former use 1 constitutes only an incidental or insubstantial part of the total activity that takes place on a lot  or 2 is commonly associated with the principal use and integrally related to it then the former use may be regarded as accessory to the principal use and may be carried beneath the umbrella of the permit issued for the principal use b for purposes of interpreting subsection a of this section 1 a use may be regarded as incidental or insubstantial if it is incidental or insubstantial in and of itself or in relation to the principal use  2 to be commonly associated with a principal use it is not necessary for an accessory use to be connected with such principal use more times than not but only that the association of such accessory use with such principal use takes place with sufficient frequency that there is common acceptance of their relatedness c without limiting the generality of subsections a
