a tax credit lowers the amount of tax owed compared to a tax deduction which lowers the amount of income subject to taxation pursuant to section 48g of the internal revenue general a dollar of tax credit reduces the amount of income tax owed by one dollar b the 20 percent rehabilitation tax credit equals 20 percent of the amount spent in a certified rehabilitation of a certified historic structure for example a $2000000 rehabilitation would result in a $400000 income tax credit the 20 percent tax credit is administered jointly by the us department of the interior and the department of the treasury the national park service nps acts on behalf of the secretary of the interior in partnership with the state historic preservation officer shpo in each state the internal revenue service irs acts on behalf of the secretary of the treasury c application for the 20 percent rehabilitation tax credit should be made in cooperation with the city and the local historic design review board 2 tax exemptions for historic properties this incentive involves the freezing of increases in property tax for historic structures local government must approve a local ordinance for tax abatement for historic properties 3 community redevelopment agencytax increment financing the local government must define the area study characterized by slum and blight to be eligible for the tax increment financing incentive program all property tax increases are to be used in the district 4 grants there are a variety of state and federal grant programs for rehabilitation of public buildings it may be possible to rehabilitate the old high school for this purpose to preserve the structure and promote economic development  1012013 appeals appeals may be taken by aggrieved persons from the decisions

conformance with the comprehensive plan and that certain public facilities will be available at prescribed levels of service concurrent with the impacts of the development on those facilities this latter requirement is known as concurrency 01 871990  1201 1162001 determination of conformance if a development proposal is found to meet all the requirements of this chapter it shall be presumed to be in conformance with the comprehensive plan in all respects except for compliance with the concurrency requirement any aggrieved or adversely affected party may however question the consistency of a development proposal with the comprehensive plan if a question of consistency is raised the development administrator or any of the appointed boards or the city council depending on which is responsible for approving the development shall make a determination of consistency or inconsistency and support that determination with written findings 02 871990  1202 1162001 development permits a a determination of project impact shall be made at two stages leading to two separate concurrency determinations the first concurrency determination shall occur prior to approval of a preliminary plat rezoning site plan or other type of development approval except a building permit as described in subsection c1 of this section the first determination shall be a criterion for project approval but shall not bind the city in any manner whatsoever to reserve capacity for the approved project b the second concurrency determination shall be made in conjunction with each application for a building permit as described in subsection c2 of this section the second determination shall constitute a reservation of capacity of those public facilities required to serve the use for which a building permit is issued for the duration of the building permit c the impact of proposed development activity on available capacity shall be determined as follows 1 all development permits except building permits other types of development permits include but are not limited to approval of subdivisions rezoning special permits and site and development plan approval these other types of development permits have less immediate impacts on public facilities and services than the issuance of a building permit therefore such a permit may be approved if the developer shows that there will be capacity available using the formula set out in section 54664a2 to meet the level of service standards set out in section 54664b g 2 building permits the issuance of a building permit has more of an immediate impact on the level of service for public facilities than may be the case with the issuance of other types of development permits therefore building permits shall be issued only when the necessary

generally 1 the purpose of this section is to ensure financial protection for the city by requiring large scale developments to pay their fair share for roadway improvements ie super walmarts andor large scale subdivisions for purposes of this section transportation mitigation means a contribution from the developer or owner of a development to the city which makes adequate financial provisions for the public transportation facilities needed to accommodate the impacts of the proposed development on roadway within the city 2 the mitigation improvement shall be deemed to make financial provisions for such facilities if it is equal to or greater than the sum of the costs of improvements attributable to the proposed development derived from the application of the formula below 3 the cost of the improvement attributable to the proposed development is based upon the sum of the cost of improving each significantly impacted county and local roadway which will operate at worse than the level of service standard in the citys comprehensive plan at each project stage or project phase and at project buildout b proportionate cost share formula 1 the proportionate share of the cost of improvements of each such roadway is calculated according to the following formula development trips ____________  cost service volume increase a development trips   cumulative number of the trips from the proposed development expected to reach the roadway during the peak hour from the complete buildout of a stage or phase being approved b service volume sv increase   the change in peak hour maximum service volume of the roadway resulting from construction of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level of service c cost   cost of construction at the time of developer payment of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level of service construction cost includes all improvement associated costs including engineering design rightofway acquisition planning engineering inspection and other associated physical development costs directly required and associated with the construction of the improvement as determined by the city 2 as used in this section a project phase means a discrete fiveyear or lesser construction timeframe of development including the city issuance of certificates of occupancy for the construction b roadway means an existing or planned road segment in its entirety or portion thereof including intersections c stage means one in a series of approximately equal increments in the development or proposed development upon which

used in this section a stage is to be a subset of a particular project phase of development planned for a project by a developer a stage of development includes both a specific type and amount of development and the associated approved buildout timeframe for that development c determination of significant impact on local roadways a local roadway shall be determined by the city to be significantly impacted by the proposed development if at a minimum the traffic projected to be generated at the end of any stage or phase of the proposed development cumulatively with the previous stages or phases will utilize five percent or more of the adopted peak hour level of service maximum service volume of the roadway and the roadway is projected to be operating below the adopted level of service standard at buildout of that stage or phase d adequate provision for transportation facilities a development order shall be determined by the city to make adequate provisions for transportation roadway facilities if at a minimum it contains one of the sets of conditions in subsection d14 or 5 of this section scheduling of facility improvements shall be as follows a schedule which specifically provides for the mitigation of impacts from the proposed development on each significantly impacted roadway which will operate below the adopted level of service standard at the end of each project phases buildout or alternatively a subset stage of that phase the schedule shall ensure that each and every roadway improvement which is necessary to achieve the adopted level of service standard for that project stage or phase shall be guaranteed to be in place and operating or under actual construction for the entire improvement at buildout of each project stage or phase that creates the significant impact this guarantee shall be in the form of 1 a clearly identified executed and recorded local development agreement consistent with fs   that is attached as an exhibit to the development order and which ensures at a minimum that all needed roadway improvements will be available concurrent with the impacts of development consistent with fs  2c  2 a binding and
