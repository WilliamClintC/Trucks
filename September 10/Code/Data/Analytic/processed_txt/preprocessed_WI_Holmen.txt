list index preface the village of holmen has over the years passed process of legislative change common to many american communities while only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the village subsequent growth of the community together with the complexity of modern life has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the village the recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history and as the community develops and changes review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws in the light of current trends must keep pace the orderly collection of these records is an important step in this evercontinuing process legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records it must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept uptodate it was with thoughts such as these in mind that the village board ordered the following codification of the villages legislation contents of various chapters of the all currently effective legislation of a general and permanent nature enacted by the village board of the village of holmen including revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the village board in the course of the codification grouping of legislation and arrangement of chapters the various items of legislation are organized into chapters their order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another wherever there are two or more items of legislation dealing with the same subject they are combined into a single chapter thus for example all legislation pertaining to the regulation of streets and sidewalks may be found in in the chapter entitled streets and sidewalks in such chapters use of article or part designations has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation table of contents the table of contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter titles of the several articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate the location of the individual item of legislation reserved chapters unassigned chapter numbers do not appear in the table of contents but are available for assignment to new enactments in this manner new subject matter can be included alphabetically pagination a unique pagenumbering system has been used in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit the first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a colon and the numeral  thus would begin on page  by the use of this system it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter or add new chapters without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages numbering of chapterrelated sectionnumbering system is employed in which each section of every item of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter thus the first section of would be  61 while the fourth section of would be  534 scheme the scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter these titles are carefully written so that taken together they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter taken separately each describes the content of a particular section for ease and precision of reference the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text histories at the end of the scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter this history indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived including the enactment number eg ordinance number local law number bylaw number resolution number etc if pertinent and the date of adoption in the case of chapters containing parts or articles derived from more than one item of legislation the source of each part or article is indicated in the text under its title amendments to individual sections or subsections are indicated by histories where appropriate in the text codification amendments and revisions new chapters adopted during the process of codification are specifically enumerated in chapter histories with reference to ch 1 general provisions where the legislation adopting this making such revisions will appear after final enactment or revised are indicated in the text by means of editors notes referring to the chapter cited above general references  editors notes in each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the a table of general references is included to direct the readers attention to such related chapters editors notes are used in the text to provide supplementary information and crossreferences to related provisions in other chapters appendix certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the main body of the are of such significance that their application is communitywide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government the appendix of this reserved for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include disposition list the disposition list is a chronological listing of legislation adopted since the publication of the indicating its inclusion in the the reason for its exclusion the disposition list will be updated with each supplement to the include the legislation reviewed with said supplement index the index is a guide to information since it is likely that this be used by persons without formal legal training the index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate a particular section quickly each section of each chapter has been indexed the index will be supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added to the for amending the changes to the whether they are amendments deletions or complete new additions should be adopted as amending the doing so existing material that is not being substantively altered should not be renumbered adding new sections where new sections are to be added to a chapter they can be added at the end of the existing material continuing the numbering sequence or inserted between existing sections as decimal numbers eg a new section between  655 and 656 should be designated  6551 adding new chapters new chapters should be added in the proper alphabetical sequence in the appropriate division or part eg administrative legislation or general legislation utilizing the reserved chapter numbers new chapter titles should begin with the key word for the alphabetical listing eg new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled vehicles abandoned under v in the table of contents and a new enactment on coinoperated amusement devices should be amusement devices or amusement devices coinoperated under a in the table of contents where a reserved number is not available an a chapter should be used eg a new chapter to be included between chapters 166 and 167 should be designated  adding new articles new articles may be inserted between existing articles in a chapter eg adding a new district to the zoning regulations by the use of a articles eg a new article to be included between articles xvi and xvii should be designated  the section numbers would be as indicated above eg if the new contains six sections and existing ends with  16630 and begins with  16631 should contain  166301  note in chapters where articles appear on the table of contents simply add new articles to the end of the chapter since they are not arranged by

hardship  circumstances where special conditions which were not selfcreated affect a particular property and make strict conformity with regulations unnecessarily burdensome or unreasonable in light of the purposes of this chapter  563 legislative findings the village board of the village of holmen finds that construction site erosion and uncontrolled stormwater runoff from landdisturbing and land development activities have significant adverse impacts upon regional water resources and the health safety property and general welfare of the community and diminish the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically soil erosion and stormwater runoff can carry sediment nutrients pathogens organic matter heavy metals toxins and other pollutants to regional lakes streams and wetlands diminish the capacity of water resources to support recreational and water supply uses and a natural diversity of plant and animal life clog existing drainage systems increasing maintenance problems and costs cause bank and channel erosion increase downstream flooding reduce groundwater recharge which may diminish stream base flows and lower water levels in regional lakes ponds and wetlands contaminate drinking water supplies increase risk of property damage and personal injury cause damage to agricultural fields and crops the village board of the village of holmen also finds that effective sediment and stormwater management depends on proper planning design and timely installation of conservation and management practices and their continuing maintenance  564 purpose and intent the purpose of this chapter is to set forth the minimum requirements for construction site erosion control and stormwater management that will diminish threats to public health safety public

fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances eg dirt litter noise glare signs and incompatible land uses buildings or parking areas between adjacent land uses the required level of bufferyard opacity is listed in figure 19580a opacity is a quantitatively derived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the abutting property the required level of opacity indicated is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts figure 19580a required bufferyard opacity values bufferyards shall meet the minimum landscaping points defined in figure 19580b opacity levels figure 19580a are met by either installing the required minimum landscaping points with no

for the bufferyard to that currently available on the site figure 19580b detailed bufferyard requirements  19581 rain gardens and bioswales rain gardens and bioswales can serve both as landscaping and stormwater management features on a building site where appropriately designed and sited definitions as used in this section the following terms have the meanings indicated rain garden  a shallow depressed garden that is designed and positioned on a site to capture stormwater runoff and allow for the infiltration of water back into the ground rain garden plants are carefully chosen for their ability to withstand moisture extremes and potentially high concentrations of nutrients and sediments that are often found in stormwater runoff a welldesigned and maintained rain garden serves as an attractive component of an overall landscaping plan for a development site bioswale  a linear vegetative stormwater runoff conveyance system that is designed to store and infiltrate water from small storm events back into the ground and direct water from heavy rain events to appropriate storm sewer inlets or other management facilities the flow of water being conveyed bioswale is slowed down allowing for municipal storm systems to more effectively manage heavier rain events and help reduce the risk of flooding on or off site water being infiltrated or conveyed via a bioswale is also filtered by the vegetation within it generally improving both ground and surface water quality requirements 1 the installation of a rain garden or bioswale may contribute to the overall stormwater management plan for a development site and count toward meeting the villages landscaping point requirements per  19578c 2 detailed plans shall be provided that show all proposed dimensions of the rain garden or bioswale including length width depth and slope of depression  location of the rain garden or bioswale on the lot relative to hardsurfaced areas downspouts and site topography

bioswale  and information on any other materials eg rocks that will be used to line the rain garden or bioswale 3 installation shall not be proposed for any of the following areas of a site a areas where there is known soil contamination unless the rain garden or bioswale is proposed to be constructed with an underdrain  b areas where the characteristics of the soil would not allow for the proper infiltration of water into the ground  or c areas where there are expected to be high levels of foot traffic 4 the owner of the site shall demonstrate that the rain garden or bioswale will be properly maintained  kept free of trash weeds debris and dead or dying plants  any pipes associated with the rain garden or bioswale shall be inspected on an annual basis and kept free of debris  and by the beginning of every spring dead plant materials shall be cut back or removed 5 bioswales and rain gardens shall be generously and appropriately vegetated to qualify for landscaping points bioswales and rain gardens or portions thereof that are lined with turf andor rocks but do not include other vegetation will not count toward meeting landscaping point requirements 6 rain gardens and
