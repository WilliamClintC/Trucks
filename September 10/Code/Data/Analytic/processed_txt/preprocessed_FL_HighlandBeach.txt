neighborhoods these sign regulations have been prepared with the intent of enhancing the visual environment of the town and promoting its continued wellbeing consistent with the most recent

town  2 maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the towns ability to attract sources of economic development and growth  3 improve pedestrian and traffic safety  4 minimize the possible adverse impact of temporary signs on nearby public and private property  5 lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation improper placement illumination animation

systems can be beneficial in efficiently adding water to the cultivated landscape the following practices shall be implemented by those developing or maintaining irrigation installations 1 irrigation of existing plant communities existing plant communities and ecosystems maintained in a natural state do not require and shall not have any additional irrigation water added in any form 2 reestablished native plant areas native plant areas that are supplements to an existing plant community or newly installed by the developer may initially require additional water to become established where newly planted native areas have been installed in soils appropriate to the proposed native system additional irrigation water after the period of establishment is unnecessary and probably harmful the water required during the establishment period shall be applied from a temporary irrigation system a water truck or by hand watering from a standard hose bib source 3 cultivated landscape areas irrigation systems either manual or automatic may be used for the cultivated landscape areas application of water properly maintained and regulated irrigation system can be the most efficient method of watering the landscape a small irrigation systems small residential and commercial areas may be irrigated with a manually controlled irrigation system if sufficient time and labor is available for its operation landscape plantings and lawns shall be watered on an as needed basis only b large irrigation systems when irrigated cultivated areas in larger residential commercial and industrial areas shall be irrigated by the use of an automatic irrigation system with controllers set to apply water as noted in this section wherever practical high water and low water use areas shall be circuited as noted below rainfall or moisture sensing devices should be used to avoid operation of the system during periods of increased rainfall b zoning of irrigation systems the water demand of lawn areas is significantly greater than the water demand of most shrubbery or ground cover areas typical residential irrigation system design does not provide for the option of irrigating lawn or other high water demand areas on a separate schedule from that of shrubbery or other reduced areas on a separate schedule from that of shrubbery or other reduced water demand areas this results in the irrigation of the entire controlled area at the rate that the most water demanding plant material requires therefore the following standards shall be considered the minimum requirements for landscape irrigation design within the jurisdiction of the south florida water management district 1 sprinkler zoning wherever feasible sprinkler head irrigating lawns or other high water demand landscape areas shall be circuited so that they are on a separate zone or zones from those irrigating trees shrubbery or other reduced water requirement areas 2 control systems automatically controlled irrigation systems shall be operated by an irrigation controller that is capable of watering high water requirement areas on a different schedule from low water requirement areas c elimination of overthrow onto nonpervious areas landscape irrigation systems shall be designed so that to the greatest extent practical water being applied to nonpervious areas is eliminated 1 impervious areas sprinkler heads shall be placed as required to reduce direct overthrow onto nonpervious areas 2 wind control the use of low trajectory spray nozzles is encouraged in order to reduce the effect of wind velocity on the spray system 3 low volume systems as technology for underground and low volume applicators of water is improved their use is encouraged 4 moisture sensing devices as technology for moisture sensing devices is improved their use is encouraged d use of nonpotable water use of nonpotable water for use in the irrigation of lawn and plant material is required when determined to be available e water application rates since deep watering promotes deep root growth and healthier plant material water shall not be applied at a precipitation rate of less than onehalf 12 inch per application f requirements for irrigation systems no significant overthrow shall be allowed onto nonpervious areas irrigation circuits shall be zoned to apply water onto lawn areas on a different schedule than those irrigating the planting beds low trajectory heads or low volume water distributing devices shall be used irrigation controllers shall be capable of irrigating grass and
