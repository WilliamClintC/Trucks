found on and around the site is usually a good indicator of which vegetation types will perform well e movement of the site earth relative to the sun landforms and other physical features will affect light and shadow patterns and their motions f local and regional climate precipitation temperature ranges humidity wind patterns etc g air and water pollution h physical features both on and off site existing or proposed buildings land forms vegetation massings etc i community social and cultural values 3 general recommendations a retaining the services of a new jersey certified landscape architect is recommended for the site analysis design and selection of plant material b a specific standard design module for street and highway plantings will not be put forth here since each site and its surroundings has a unique character a downtown street tree planting may only require a single species of shade tree equally spaced in a geometric pattern with the landscape forms most often found in westampton township the use of a single species of trees in geometric patterns becomes less appropriate the linear less formal hedgerow seen commonly bounding cropland fields and pastures is often a more suitable model for plantings along lot lines and street and highways traversing such landscapes c rather than specify a modular design to be used on each design proposal the following plant material density for a hypothetical fiftyfootlong by twentyfivefootwide module which could be repeated as many times as necessary both in length and width eg a site with a highway frontage of 500 feet and a onehundredfootwide buffer requirement would need 40 modules the plant material requirements of these modules may be arranged to suit the specific landscape design objectives of the proposed plan  the front yard buffer module shall include two canopy trees ie large deciduous trees and three understory trees ie deciduous andor evergreen trees that do not generally reach the mature height of the canopy trees  1968 westampton code  1968  species selection should be based on an appropriate woodland successional model and shall include species from the following list of canopy and understory trees canopy and understory trees canopy trees red oak quercus rubra white oak quercus alba black oak quercus velutina chestnut oak quercus prinus pin oak quercus palustris red maple acer
