pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference or no local limit exists but the discharge did not change

applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 terms defined a bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production  17750 monaca code  17750  2 an industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation these bypasses are not

bypass if possible an industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the potw within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times  and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the potw may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours 4 exceptions a bypass is prohibited and the potw may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless  bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage   there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and  the industrial user submitted notices as required under 3 of this section b the potw may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potw determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in 4a of this section  17750 real estate registry  17750  article iv holding tanks adopted 3101998 by   17751 purpose the purpose of this

management   1992 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater and increased runoff flows and velocities which overtax the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increase the cost to the public to manage stormwater b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and streambanks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge c a program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes g nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the municipality  1991 storage areas  1993   1993 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and welfare within the municipality and its watershed by minimizing

stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes e focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources f maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses g meet legal water quality requirements under
