watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development bconstruction stage 1upon placement of the lowest floor and before construction continues or floodproofing by whatever construction means it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator and to the state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation as built in relation to mean sea level in ae al30 ah and a zones where the community has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct

passed 9506  15252 appeals and variance procedures anature of variances 1the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate bdesignation of variance and appeal board city council shall establish an appeal board consisting of the board of adjustments cduties of variance and appeal board 1the appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter 2any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the campbell circuit court as provided in kentucky revised statutes dappealsvariance procedures in passing upon such applications the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  5necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  6availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10expected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges and culverts econditions for variances 1upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 2variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 3variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 4variances shall only be issued upon aa showing of good and sufficient cause  ba determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  and ca determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in  15205 public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in  15205 or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation 6the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema upon request 7variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of divisions d1 d5 above are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance fvariance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars $2500 for one hundred dollars $10000 of insurance coverage and  2such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the campbell county clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance or denial and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the federal emergency management agency ghistoric structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see definition in  15205 upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is

zoning regulations aphased zoning is an overlay type regulation to be used in cases where the timing andor phasing of the zoning of an area is especially critical to the implementation of the adopted comprehensive plan the intent of the phased zoning regulations is to encourage redevelopment of a specified area for the use or density designated on the comprehensive plan when the necessary conditions for such development are realized eg demolition of existing deteriorated areas  provision of urban services such as public water and centralized sanitary sewer systems implicit in such a phased zoning approach is the premise that until such conditions are realized the type of development identified by the comprehensive plan is premature  such development would be prevented by temporarily zoning the area to generally conform with the predominant existing land use with a clear stipulation of an intended future rezoning which would be in compliance with the adopted comprehensive plan bthe phased zoning regulations may be overlaid over any zoning classification by means of a conventional zone change process the use of the phased zoning regulations would indicate that the regulations of the overlaid zone are currently being enforced based upon the general existing land use but on attainment of all the requirements of the zone which corresponds to the adopted comprehensive plan for type of use or density the area could be rezoned in direct compliance with the plan cphased zones are indicated on the official zoning map by adding to the overlaid zone the letter p as a suffix enclosed in parentheses for example in order to properly phase its change an area zoned r1jj which is identified for future use on the adopted comprehensive plan for industrial could be temporarily zoned r1jj p indicated that present development on the site would be in conformance with the regulations of the overlaid r1jj zone but that upon the attainment of certain conditions for example provision of flood levee and demolition of existing buildings as indicated on the local comprehensive plan the area could be rezoned conventional zone change procedure at the time of the zone change the temporary r1jj p zone is removed and the area is developed according to the regulations of the new zone which is in conformance with the adopted comprehensive plan dthe minimum size of any area to be rezoned as regulated by this section of the ordinance is five acres provided that all other provisions of this appendix and the subdivision regulations are adhered to development of a smaller tract adjacent to an existing zone being requested may be permitted if the proposed development conforms to and extends the original development as if the new area had been a part of the original development and provided further that the zone is in conformance with the comprehensive plan passed 4417 cellular or wireless communication systems apurpose 1the purpose of these
