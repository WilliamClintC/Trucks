there are also areas within the city in which greater emphasis on regulating form and character of development should be considered as well as use and intensity of use the downtown formbased dfbc districts use formbased provisions to accomplish this with a special sensitivity to the contextual relevance of two 2 unique downtown subdistricts within the overall dfbc this unique zoning district allows the city to regulate land use in a more flexible format for this specific area to encourage a viable dynamic mix of uses physically the dfbc is intended to promote a unified vision for supporting the historic commercial core of the city of milan focused on increased and maintained land use intensity and improved public amenities that are oriented as much to the needs of the

compact walkable environment that creates new opportunities for investment while protecting quality attributes of the existing area specifically the dfbc will do the following a ensure that development is of human scale primarily pedestrianoriented and designed to create attractive streetscapes and pedestrian spaces b promote mixeduse development in both a horizontal and vertical form c ensure reasonable transition between higher intensity development and adjacent neighborhoods d provide economic development opportunities by allowing a wider range of potential uses and creative redevelopment techniques that will expand the employment base and value of land e provide a simple predictable efficient way to allow complex innovative development that would otherwise require special planning procedures f encourage the incubation of a residential element within the traditional downtown to foster a twentyfour 24hour community g establish a development pattern in which new buildings and building modifications enhance the character of the existing built environment city of milan 5  2 h orient building entrances and storefronts to the street to add visual interest put
