conservation district which is nearest to the construction site in question hydrodynamic loads  these loads or pressures are primarily lateral in nature as the floodwaters flow around a structure at moderate to high velocities they impose additional loads on the structure these loads consist of frontal impact by the mass of moving water against the projected width of the obstruction represented by the structure drag effect along the sides of the structure and eddies or negative pressures on the downstream side hydrostatic loads  these loads or pressures at any point of floodwater contact with the structure are equal in all directions and always act perpendicular to the surface on which they are applied pressures increase lineally with depth of head water above the point under consideration the summation of pressures over the surface under consideration represents the load acting on that surface for structural analysis purposes hydrostatic loads are defined to act vertically downward on structural elements such as roofs decks and similar overhead members having a depth of water above them vertically upward or uplift when they act at the underside of generally horizontal members such as slabs and footings and the net effect is upward and laterally when they act in a horizontal direction on walls piers and similar vertical structural elements it is assumed that hydrostatic conditions prevail for still water and water moving with a velocity of less than five feet per second impact loads  these loads are induced on the structure by solid objects and masses carried by or floating on the moving water surface these loads are the most difficult to predict and define with any degree of accuracy yet reasonable allowances must be made for these loads in the design and potential debris problems at the site and to the degree of exposure of the structure in relationship to its general setting lowest floor  the lowest floor of the lowest fully enclosed

credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section d credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body
