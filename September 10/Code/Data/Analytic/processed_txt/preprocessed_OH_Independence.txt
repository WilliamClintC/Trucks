in the preparation of the 2019 replacement pages contents preliminary unit comparative tables of speclal ordinances codified ordinances of independence ohio  charter  part one  administrative three  traffic six  general offenses seven business regulation nine  streets and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen building fifteen fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that

classification the fume classification of an explosive shall be determined from the total volume of carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide emitted in the bichel gage by one one and onefourth by eightinch cartridge of the explosive to be tested the standard procedure of the federal bureau of mines modified to give results in terms of cubic feet per cartridge of explosive shall be used this is as follows one cartridge of the explosive one and one fourth by eight inches or smaller in its original wrapper is fired in the bichel gage a gage of the bourdon type is substituted for the regular indicator mechanism this bourdon gage is connected to the chamber of the bomb after the shot is fired before the shot is fired the bomb is evacuated until a vacuum of fifty plus or minus five mm is obtained the vacuum data used are the difference between the barometer reading for the atmosphere and the manometer reading for the gage in order that the testing engineer may be assured of obtaining a vacuum and that there may be no clogged lines the valve connection for the pressure for the pressure gage on top of the bomb should be left open until the vacuum pump has been started and air is sucking valve the charge is fired by means of a no 6 electric detonator embedded in the charge within the bomb five minutes after the shot is fired the stopcock which intervenes between the bomb and the bourdon gage is opened and the pressure noted when the gage reading is obtained the gaseous products within the gage have cooled to approximately room temperature the volume of the gases and vapors at o c and at a pressure of 760 mm of mercury is calculated from the data obtained which comprise gage temperature gage pressure barometric pressure and volume of the bomb approximately fifteen litters onehalf hour after the shot is fired a sample of the gases and vapors is taken valve to which the air pump was attached the gases are allowed to escape from the gage slowly by cracking the valve and a 200cc sample is thereby collected over mercury in the aspirator is allowed to run out and the gases and vapors that follow it are drawn off until the pressure within the bomb is reduced to that of the atmosphere  therefore the sample of gases and vapors taken is a differential one the gaseous products are analyzed by means of an orsat apparatus and the amounts of carbon dioxide oxygen carbon monoxide hydrogen methane nitrogen and hydrogen sulfide are determined the amounts of these gases are calculated to cubic feet per cartridge of explosive the average result of three analyses is accepted if the average deviation from the mean is less than plus or minus 125 percent  otherwise further analyses are made until the above criterion is satisfied or until six analyses have been made in which latter instance the average of the six is accepted a second calculation is made to determine whether the amount of oxygen in the gaseous products is more than adequate to burn the combustible gases to their maximum oxidizable state that is hydrogen to water methane to water and carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide to water and sulfur trioxide b fume classes the amount of poisonous gases produced per one and onefourth by eightinch cartridge shall be as follows  fume class cubic feet 1 less than 016 2 016 to  3 033 to 067 cartridges of explosives eight inches in length that are smaller in diameter than one and onefourth inches shall comply with the limit specified for the fume class of the one and onefourth by eightinch cartridge for cartridges smaller than eight inches in length

among other things the following purposes a to provide for the planning of attractive neighborhoods which recognize the natural topography and other physical features of the development area  b to protect and maintain all existing wetland areas in the city  c to relate the planning of neighborhoods to a pedestrian and vehicular circulation system to implement the street plan to provide convenient and safe local streets  d to provide protected neighborhoods  to plan a common green area network where desired  however under all types of neighborhood planning each lot shall form a functional building site  e to provide for the implementation of the community facilities plan by reserving and acquiring sites for public uses  f to provide for planned industrial subdivisions by the application of the same basic planning criteria  and g to provide for the coordination of planning and division of land in connection with planned development areas to carry out the objectives of the master plan passed 51292 111102 topography and natural features land developments shall be planned to preserve the topography of the land in order to utilize the natural contours and reduce the amount of grading and to minimize destruction of trees wetlands and natural drainageways the natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be integrated into the plan to create functional elements in the neighborhoods detailed topographic maps and aerial photography shall be utilized in the land planning and subdivision process a streets and topography land which is relatively flat or of very gentle undulations shall be planned so that the streets follow the natural drainage courses and insofar as possible all building sites shall be above the street grade on more irregular topography streets should follow the ridges or be planned approximately parallel to contour lines and designed to avoid extensive cuts and fills b natural drainage all developments particularly of land of very gentle slopes shall be designed to take advantage of natural contours so that all the land can be drained with the minimum of reshaping unless water courses or drainage ways are enclosed the plan shall be adjusted so that rear lot lines or areas held as public or private common land shall be approximately parallel to the natural watercourse and only where such a plan is not practical may side lot lines be arranged parallel to an open drainage course easements for drainage ways and lowlying areas which are subject to flooding may be included as part of the lot but shall not be utilized as a building site if a watercourse traverses the development at any point the following language shall be inserted on the preliminary plan and final plat and signed by the property owners watercourse acceptance it is understood and agreed that a watercourse traverses this subdivision and these properties may be subject to erosion and drainage problems as a result and all property owners their successors and assigns by the acceptance hereof hereby acknowledge the same and assume the risk thereof and agree to indemnify and hold the city of independence harmless from

between intersections access driveways to developments and sublots between intersecting streets should be regulated insofar as possible to one driveway at intervals of 200 feet this may be accomplished by combining the access to several developments or by other means b the collector street system collector streets connect the local residential street system and the arterial street system and should be oriented to one or more focal points of traffic generation they should be planned for continuity and will normally contain a number of intersections with local streets c relation to residential developments whenever a one family residential development abuts an arterial street the commission may in order to protect residential property from the movements of heavy traffic and to control intersections with arterial streets require 1 marginal streets parallel to the arterial streets  2 reverse frontage lots between an arterial street and a parallel local street with screen planting located on a nonaccess reservation along the right ofway line of the arterial street  3 the fronting of lots with extra width on perpendicular local streets  or 4 extra depth fronting on the

of local streets is to provide direct access to each lot of the development area the local street system should be designed to minimize movements this should be accomplished by peripheral collector street design by offsetting local street intersections and by providing loop streets or culdesac streets every part of a residential area should however be interconnected for convenience and to avoid excessive indirect travel except where connections are not feasible because of topographic conditions the pattern should be logical and comprehensive for the convenience of the local residents visitors and for providing services the design should be planned to provide these basic functions without relying on excessive traffic regulations the streets should be designed for uniformly low volumes of traffic commensurate with residential amenities and to discourage speeds of more than twentyfive miles per hour there shall be a basic underlying street design related to topography and other natural features the pattern should also be related to attaining functional economical and practical patterns and shapes and sizes of areas for development necessary traffic generators such as schools and playgrounds should serve as focal points in the pattern there should be a minimum number of intersections and tintersections should predominate a rightofway and pavement widths whenever local streets are planned in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section the rightofway width of such street shall be sixty feet and the pavement width between curbs shall be twentysix feet
