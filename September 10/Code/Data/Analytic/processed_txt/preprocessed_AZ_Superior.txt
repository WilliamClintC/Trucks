the authority to approve a request for a parking adjustment subject to the provisions of this section the decision of which may be appealed to the board of adjustment as provided in  37 of this for land uses located in the town center zone district offstreet parking requirements may be modified by the commission by utilizing any combination of the following techniques a a reduction of the required number of parking spaces by fifty 50 percent b the crediting of onstreet parking spaces which are adjacent to the frontage of the designated structuresite towards the total number of required offstreet parking spaces required for the use provided that a determination is made that such onstreet parking will remain available for public parking during business hours in the future c allow the use of offsite parking in parking lots that are located within four hundred 400 feet of the structure where the applicant has provided adequate incentives for the use of such parking lots d allow vehicles to back out onto alleys or streets where it is determined that such backing out of vehicles can be done safely e allow fifty 50 percent of a parking lot located on the site of the structureuse to be compact spaces f allow tandem parking where it is determined that such parking would be effectively and safely used g provide for inlieu fees where such fees are applied to an identified parking district or other similar mechanism that will contribute to the development of public parking within the general area 3 findings for approval the commission shall find any of the following a the proposed parking modification and use of the structure is necessary or desirable for the greater development of the community is in harmony with the various elements and objectives of the general plan and is not detrimental to existing uses or to uses specifically permitted in the town center zone district b that approving the proposed parking adjustment will significantly improve the possibility that structures will be preserved and maintained c that the proposed parking scheme will function safely d that the approval of the parking adjustment will not harm the integrity of the structure of the surrounding neighborhood 4 offstreet parking and loading requirements as specified in this may be further modified by the commission for properties located within the town center zone district when it has been determined that every effort has been made to comply with the provisions of this specifically  46 and  47 and the commission determines that it is in the best interest of the town to further wave or eliminate the parking requirements set forth in this as a condition of approval to the granting of a reduction in required parking the commission may require the granting of reciprocal access and parking agreements with surrounding properties recordation of conditions covenants and restrictions or other legal instruments to assure the permanent continuation of the circumstances under which parking requirement reductions were granted 146  47 shared parking a a reduction of the minimum parking requirements for individual uses may be granted by the planning and zoning commission where joint use of parking facilities or other factors will mitigate peak parking demand 147 b requests for parking reductions resulting from joint usage shall be supported by information that generally follows the format described below 1 initial project review involves quantification of proposed land uses and anticipated functional relationships between the parking needs of different land uses the initial review will consist of data gathering regarding general location of parking facilities surrounding land uses predicted pedestrian patterns and similar variables which affect parking needs 2 adjustments for shared parking includes calculating the number of offstreet parking spaces required for each land use within the area proposed for joint parking based upon requirements of this in granting a parking reduction for shared use of parking facilities the planning and zoning commission shall make one or more of the following findings 1 the report justifies the requested parking reduction based upon the presence of two 2 or more adjacent land uses which because of their substantially different operating hours or difference peak parking characteristics will allow joint use of the same parking facilities 2 the report finds that the use otherwise adheres to the parking standards in this the report finds that the clustering of different land uses is such that a reduced number of parking spaces can serve multiple trip purposes to the area in question d as a condition of approval to the granting of shared parking the planning and zoning commission may require the granting of reciprocal access and parking agreements with surrounding properties recordation of conditions covenants and restrictions or creation of other legal instruments to assure the permanent continuation of the circumstances under which parking requirement reductions were granted 148 table of contents article xv  outdoor lighting provisions 150 purpose 152 151 conformance with
