sexually oriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3 offering sexually oriented entertainment

characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those compelling and substantial governmental concerns 8 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the village it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9 the regulation of nudity seminudity and physical contact between employees and patrons in sexually oriented businesses will further the compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing prostitution and other sexrelated crimes including illegal sex acts and protecting the public health safety and welfare 10 requiring open sight lines in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate

welfare 11 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the compelling and substantial government interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12 a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business 13 barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal

article iii  publication dispensing devices division 1  generally findings and purpose a the village has a substantial interest in promoting the public health safety welfare and convenience of its citizens and visitors by ensuring that public streets public sidewalks and public rightsofway are not unreasonably obstructed by publication dispensing devices and that publication dispensing devices are properly maintained b the public rightsofway historically have been used to circulate publications c the substantial growth in the number of publications has produced a proliferation of freestanding publication dispensing devices located on public rightsofway that have contributed to the congestion of public sidewalks impeded the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic interfered with the use of streets public sidewalks and public rightsofway  and poorly maintained or abandoned freestanding publication dispensing devices have presented hazards to persons and property contributed to the litter problems of public sidewalks and resulted in visual blight d the village has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting its unique visual and aesthetic qualities and to that end the village must take steps to reduce the visual blight the inconvenience and the hazards associated with unlimited numbers and designs of publication dispensing devices poorly maintained publication dispensing devices and the virtually unrestricted placement of publication dispensing devices on public streets public sidewalks and public rightsofway e the unregulated placement and maintenance of individual publication dispensing devices in the public rightsofway interferes with the free and unimpeded use of such public rightsofway and threatens the health safety and welfare of persons who use the public rightsofway including pedestrians children the aged persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings drivers persons performing essential utility traffic control and emergency services and persons with disabilities f the unregulated placement of multicolored broken rusted and abandoned individual publication dispensing devices of various shapes and sizes in the public rightofways significantly detracts from the aesthetic character of surrounding areas due to the limited space available and the congestion on certain public sidewalks streets and public rightsofway the village has a substantial interest in devising an approach to placement of publication dispensing devices in those areas that promote public health safety and welfare and the aesthetic quality of the village g an effective way to reduce the visual clutter and hazards associated with excessive numbers of publication dispensing devices is to prohibit freestanding publication dispensing devices in congested areas and to allow only modular publication dispensing devices in these areas this objective may be achieved by creating a modular publication dispensing device district in congested areas or areas that have particular public safety aesthetic historical or economic concerns and the permitting of freestanding publication dispensing devices outside these districts allowing modular publication dispensing devices and prohibiting freestanding publication dispensing devices and unauthorized modular publication dispensing devices in modular publication dispensing device districts and regulating the location of publication dispensing devices on the public rightofway and other public areas outside of the modular publication dispensing device districts will promote the villages interest in promoting public safety reducing visual blight and clutter protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the village and advancing the economic interests of the villages businesses and residents by improving the appearance of the area and resulting in better use of space and reduced congestion while respecting publications interests in effective distribution a reasonable accommodation of these competing interests can be achieved by adoption of this article which regulates the placement size construction design maintenance and appearance of publication dispensing devices in specified areas h based on the findings described above it is further found that there is a need for reasonable time place and manner restrictions regarding the installation placement size appearance and maintenance of publication dispensing devices in the public rightsofway consistent with these findings it is the purpose of this article to promote the health safety and welfare of users of the public rightsofway and to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the village by controlling the placement size construction and appearance of publication dispensing devices and modular publication dispensing devices in a manner which may utilize publication dispensing devices as a method of distribution of publications so as to accomplish the following to the extent reasonably possible 1 provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience 2 restrict unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including ingress and egress from any residence or place of business or from the street to the sidewalk by persons exiting or entering parked or standing vehicles 3 provide for the safety of the public and property during windstorms and other inclement weather 4 replace remove or relocate individual publication dispensing devices that have created visual blight on the public rightsofway or unreasonably detracted from the aesthetics of adjacent businesses landscaping and other improvements 5 maintain and protect the values of surrounding properties 6 reduce unnecessary exposure of the public to personal injury and property damage 7 ensure compliance with the americans with disabilities act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly located publication dispensing devices 8 provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and maintenance of sidewalks poles posts traffic signs or signals hydrants mailboxes delivery areas loading zones transit shelters curb ramps and locations used for public transportation services 9 reduce visual blight and clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained improperly located or abandoned publication dispensing devices 10 protect the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the village 11 advance the economic interests of the villages businesses and residents including the interests of those involved in the publication or distribution of publications dispensing devices 12 respect the publishers interests in effective distribution including a allowing publications currently distributed from freestanding publication dispensing devices to receive distribution space in modular publication dispensing devices located at or as close as reasonably possible to the locations of such freestanding publication dispensing devices  b allowing publications not currently distributed from freestanding publication dispensing devices to receive distribution space in modular publication dispensing devices  c allowing the number locations and usage of modular publication dispensing devices to change over time in response to changing market conditions  and d providing for modular publication dispensing devices and prompt and effective maintenance repair and replacement of freestanding publication dispensing devices including providing for the maintenance repair and replacement of parts of such publication dispensing devices which if not thus maintained repaired or replaced could significantly impede the effective use of such publication dispensing device i this article is not intended to and does not ban freestanding publication dispensing devices on public sidewalks streets and public rightsofway throughout the village

shall be made by the village board that conditions warrant such installation consideration for the permanent installation of a stop sign will be based on the criteria provided in this division    mandatory criteria a permanent installation of a stop sign shall require that one or more of the following conditions exists 1 intersection of a less important street with a main street where application of the normal rightofway rule is unduly hazardous 2 street entering a or street 3 unsignalized intersection in a signalized area 4 other intersections where a combination of high speed restricted view and serious accident record indicates a need for control by a stop sign 5 an accident problem as indicated by five or more reported accidents of a type within a 12month period susceptible to correction by a stop sign installation such accidents include right and left turn collisions as well as right angle collisions b stop signs shall not be erected at intersections where trafficcontrol signals are operating however this does not preclude the installation of stop signs at such intersections where trafficcontrol signals may be rendered inoperable    discretionary criteria to assist in the review process for the installation of stop signs the following considerations are offered as guidelines in the placement of such stop sign 1 where two main highways intersect stop signs should normally be posted on the minor street to stop the lesser flow of traffic traffic engineering studies however may justify a decision to install a stop sign on the major street 2 stop signs may be used at selected railroadhighway grade crossings only after their need has been determined by a detailed traffic engineering study 3 the multiway stop installation is useful as a safety measure at some locations it should ordinarily be used only where the volume of traffic on the intersection streets is approximately equal 4 prior to the application of any warrants as contained herein consideration is to be given to less restrictive measures such as the yield sign where a full stop is not necessary at all times    minimum traffic volume a unless otherwise specifically provided by the village board based on expressed considerations of public safety and convenience stop signs shall not be installed unless the intersection under consideration meets or exceeds the following minimum traffic volume measurements 1 the total vehicular volume entering the intersection from all approaches must average at least 500 vehicles per hour for any eight hours of an average day  and 2 the combined vehicular and pedestrian volume from the minor street or highway must average at least 200 units per hour for the same eight hours with an average delay to minor street vehicular traffic of at least 30 seconds per vehicle during the maximum hour b however when the 85 percentile approach speed of the major street traffic exceeds 40 miles per hour the minimum vehicular volume warrant is 70 percent of the above requirements    additional criteria for multiway stop signs any of the following conditions warrant consideration of a multiway stop sign installation 1 where traffic signals are warranted and urgently needed the multiway stop is an interim measure that can be installed quickly to control traffic while arrangements are being made for the signal installation 2 an accident problem as indicated by five or more reported accidents reported within a 12month period of a type susceptible to correction by a multiway stop sign installation including right and left turn collisions as well as right angle collisions    placement  design and content a stop signs shall be erected as directed by the village board including but not limited to
