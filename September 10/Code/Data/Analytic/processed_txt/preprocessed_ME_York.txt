relatives have a financial capacity to do so therefore legally liable relatives who are eligible for general assistance by virtue of their eligibility have no legal obligation to pay for the burial or

or more of the financially liable relatives is found to have a financial capacity to make a partial financial contribution or the administrator is unable to determine the financial capacity of one or more of said relatives under these circumstances each legally liable relative is considered to be responsible for his or her pro rata share of the total municipal contribution that would exist if no legally liable relatives had a financial capacity to contribute furthermore and as long as all other eligibility factors have been satisfied the municipality will provide as a burial or cremation benefit the aggregate of all pro rata shares less the share of any legally liable relative who refuses to cooperate with the administrator by providing information or documentation reasonably

commission will be guided by the following design principles which have been adapted from the secretary of the interiors standards for the treatment of historic properties 1995  the historic character of a property should be retained and preserved the removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property should be avoided  each property should be recognized as a physical record of its time place and use changes that create a false sense of historical development such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties should be avoided  changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right should be retained and preserved  new additions exterior alterations or related new construction that destroy historic materials features and spatial relationships that characterize the property should be avoided new work should be differentiated from the old and should be compatible with the historic materials features size scale proportion and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment  new additions and adjacent or related new construction which if removed in the future would impair the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment should be avoided design review process a completed application for work subject to review by the historic district commission must be obtained from the officer applications for either of certificate of appropriateness or demolition shall be forward by the officer to the chairman of the historic district commission a completed application must be received at least seven days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting to be placed on the agenda yorks historic districts are

a public way park or body of water must be reviewed and approved by the commission such changes include but are not limited to replacements and alterations to windows doors roofs building materials new construction additions fences walls and landscaping for the purposes of determining visibility existing and proposed wooden fences and landscaping are considered impermanent and are deemed not to block sight lines from a public way if there is a question regarding visibility the final determination will be made by the chair of the commission or the chairs designee what changes are not reviewed the commission does not review paint colors and ordinary likekind exact duplicate repairs and replacements of existing historic fabric shutters are exempt from review however shutters and blinds to use the correct term when they have louvers are important historical features on a house they also became important decorative features with the advent of the colonial revival style in the late nineteenth century property owners are strongly urged to retain wood shutters and blinds and to have them mounted with hardware as they would if operable storm doors and storm windows are also exempt

features such as small paned windows pediments and shutters similarly wood shingles shakes wood vinyl or aluminum siding and brick or stone veneer treatments should be avoided simplicity is usually

last indefinitely when properly maintained 16 local historic district guidelines town of york  2005 local historic district guidelines  town of york  2005 17 outbuildings public improvements and landscaping outbuildings are integral to the historic character of many york buildings and should be maintained in their original physical relationship to the main building as important and often rare historic structures outbuildings are governed by the same guidelines used for principal structures conversions for other uses should respect characterdefining features such as irregular fenestration patterns and large barn or garage door openings street furniture including benches lighting paving trash receptacles and planters should respect the historic character of the urban or rural surroundings of buildings generally historic materials are the most compatible while lighting is a modern reality and a necessity for traffic safety and security reasons its use in historic districts should be limited lighting should be kept at low levels discretely designed to harmonize with the structure or landscaping and shielded to prevent glare or overspill of the light off the property the style and materials of light fixtures when visible from the public way should be appropriate to the historic character of the district large expanses of paving are inconsistent with the character of yorks historic districts landscaping such as plantings andor fencing should be employed for screening the cars and pavement from public view the existing natural contours and topography of the

varieties shingled barn with characteristic fenestration barn with windows and doors altered with modern domestic fenestration that is not compatible with the historic character of the building fences and walls if a new fence or wall is on or within two feet of the front of a retaining wall then the height of the new fence or wall should be measured from the grade on the lower side of the retaining wall if a new fence or wall is on or near a retaining wall then the visual impact of the combined height from the lower side should be taken into account when possible ground units should be located unobtrusively and screened with vegetation andor fencing including lattice fences fences running from the side of a building to a side yard fence should not be more than 42 inches high if a higher

the land area within the town of york including land in the former york harbor village corporation area and land in the former york beach village corporation 13 purposes  general in the broadest sense the zoning protect public health safety and welfare by encouraging appropriate use of land and protection of resources by following policy directions of the comprehensive plan and state statutes the remainder of this section describes what citizens of york seek to achieve with zoning york has a large land area with a diversity of landscapes seashore tidewater forested hills open fields and picturesque villages intensity of development ranges from large wild undeveloped tracts of land around mt agamenticus to rural farms and forests to suburbanstyle neighborhoods to densely developed villages from its historical beginnings the landscape has influenced settlement patterns and to this day the mountain cape neddick the village the harbor the beach and other areas of town have retained much of their distinctive personalities a large influx of seasonal residents and tourists swells the population several fold in the summer there is a trend toward the seasonal influx starting earlier and ending later conversion of homes from seasonal to yearround use is contributing to the growing yearround population sitting astride interstate 95 and served by the last exit south of the tollbooth york is highly susceptible to regional influences york is within commuting distance of three major metropolitan areasportsmouth portland and boston good highway infrastructure and the impending arrival of the bostonportland passenger rail service put york at great risk of increased use as a bedroom community while regional influences can bring diversity and enrichment to the town they also stress the unique community character which citizens highly value the balance between regional and local control should favor the local community whenever such decisions are possible among the oldest towns in maine yorks historic and archeological resources are important these resources are varied and scattered throughout town though there are some concentrations protection of historic resources is more complex than only preserving colonial buildings land features have historic significance archeological sites may be obliterated by development some buildings are important representations of more recent eras such as the old chevy dealership in the village and the row of summer houses along long sands beach yorks natural resource base is highly varied and fragile and contributes greatly to the towns quality of life the atlantic ocean dominates the eastern edge of town with its rocky coast the beaches and the harbor inland the land rises to mount agamenticus and nearby hills slopes are generally moderate but soils are generally poor wetlands town of york zoning  7 and shorelands abound and need careful protection the tidal york and cape neddick rivers lie almost entirely within york and the york river is the dominant landscape feature on the southwestern side of york the town wants to enhance sustainable resourcebased activities including farming forestry fishing recreation and hunting an extensive undeveloped block of forested open space surrounds mount agamenticus and the watersheds of the york and kittery water supplies protection of these surface water supplies is of paramount importance this area is also where the northern forest blends into the southern forest presenting a rich diversity of plant communities further fragmentation of this area by development and new roads should be discouraged this area and other large unbroken tracts of land are important wildlife habitat and in general have high recreation existence and aesthetic values the visual character of york is exceptional and is an important factor contributing to quality of life and the economy the natural and historic resources contribute significantly as does protecting open space encouraging compatible design of development retaining narrow winding treelined roads and maintaining the strong contrasts between different areas in the community scenic vistas abound many of which are public views across wellmanaged private land access to and responsible use of natural resources is important townspeople continue to seek access to natural resources open space and the ocean however there are concerns associated with access rights of ownership overuse of resources and vandalism are a few of the concerns that must be addressed ideally access can continue to be accommodated and expanded arrangements with private property owners tourism makes a significant contribution to yorks economy the tourism industry and seasonal housing provide income for residents seasonal housing generates net property tax revenues seasonal businesses and housing should be maintained tourists and seasonal residents are drawn to york in large part because of its beaches its waterfront its scenic beauty and its historic small town character other than tourism there is a growing yearround business sector in the community several largescale businesses have been established in york in recent years while there are questions about scale and character of the big new development there is support for continued development of small locally owned businesses homebased businesses traditional resourcebased businesses especially farming forestry and fishing and other businesses which can meet stringent performance standards are desired housing in york is problematic there is a deficit of elderly and affordable housing despite the housing construction boom large expensive homes are being built throughout town often out of scale with the surrounding neighborhoods an adequate supply of seasonal housing should be maintained incentives are needed to help provide elderly and affordable housing to serve community needs roads range from narrow winding treelined roads to the six lanes of i95 the network of arterial and collector roads is congested with seasonal traffic and congestion is becoming a yearround issue development along route one is congesting the road requiring added traffic signals and is changing the character of the highway corridor historic rural and neighborhood roads contribute significantly to the towns character neighborhood roads should be designed to control traffic flow reduce speeds and reduce conflicts with pedestrians and bicyclists the town should seek to keep rural gravel roads unpaved new and reconstructed roads should be designed to have effective shareduse design for multiple modes traffic calming and access management should be promoted to prevent congestion increase safety and reduce air pollution automobile access to the beaches is indirect and adds to circulation problems in york village and the harbor pedestrian circulation is often difficult and dangerous in the villages which should be safe and pleasant there are few provisions for bicycle circulation anywhere in york parking should be redesigned in york village and at the beach zoning which controls commercial trucking in residential neighborhoods should be encouraged the component communities within the town of york from the outset of settlement expected to serve a variety of functions such as farming fishing forestry commerce shipping and governance they are defined both economically and politically they have evolved until the present still distinctive in character but integral to the whole community while york is not strictly speaking a small town its people take pride in yorks small town character attributes of the town of york which exemplify small town character are a small towns heritage  few traffic lights  low population density when calculated over the entire land mass  unique and distinguishable village residential and rural areas  interaction of people in town  high regard among people in different parts of town  volunteer fire department  a sense of safety  knowing the people with whom one does business  and a local labor force enhancing the ability of yorks citizens to afford homes in their community and to create and sustain low impact businesses in york is vital to the character of the community town of york zoning  8 in general the villages have higher population density  compromised pedestrian and bicyclist circulation  local owneroperated businesses  public services and infrastructure  acquaintances among business people and residents  and a mix of small scale residential commercial historic and civic land uses each village has its unique combination of these attributes zoning should allow continuation and enhancement of these characteristics existing villages should continue to serve both residents and tourists the attributes of rural lands in york are mixed land use which includes home occupations and traditional rural uses such as farming forestry and fishing  narrow treelined roads open space between homes which is different from spacing in the village centers  separation of built areas by natural features such as forests water or fields  open spaces between villages  abundance of natural resources  large unbroken tracts of land and water  scenic vistas  public lands  lack of infrastructure  recreational lands  low overall density  and appropriately scaled buildings businesses in the rural area should look good mitigate adverse impacts and be an asset to the community in between the rural areas and village centers are a range of lower density primarily residential areas on the east of route one and commercial activities along the route one corridor it is important for the town to recognize that many property owners practice responsible and sustainable resource management in matters ranging from preservation of historic buildings to keeping open land undeveloped to engaging in sustainable forestry practices many property owners do a great job and deserve the towns thanks still individuals make decisions that cause change development can inalterably change the community through this the town must strike a balance between rights of development and the public interest zoning should allow the capability of building in harmony with natural and historic resources require the preservation of unique characteristics of the surrounding properties and maintain traditions of established land uses the design of new development should be compatible in scale mass height roof line rhythm transparency setback and other such elements with the design of surrounding properties and landscape development must not compromise the unique characteristics of york and its neighborhoods with standardized uniform or franchise designs 1 general a to protect and promote public and traffic safety  b to manage development patterns to meet the needs of yorks yearround and seasonal residents and its tourism oriented economy  c to encourage the most appropriate use of land along various sections of route one based upon its location existing development patterns and desired future growth patterns  d to conserve and promote yorks scenic beauty and attractiveness as a residential town and tourist center  e to establish fair and reasonable standards for evaluating each development proposal on its own merits and to effectively manage project impacts  and  f to protect property values 2 to this end property along route one has been divided into six separate zoning districts with the following specific purposes a route one1 zone river protection to establish an area that 1 protects the aesthetic and environmental quality of the york river  2 serves as an attractive gateway to the town of york  and 3 allows only a limited number of compatible uses residential public educational and small scale professional offices it is perceived by citizens that a sense of the character of those components or segments of the community is being lost to newcomers neutralized by homogenous architecture and paved over with development there is deep concern that the rich heritage of a complex community is about to be lost in conclusion york is wonderful and unique and its citizens want to protect it change should be slow planned sustainable in harmony with nature aesthetically pleasing financially sound and of minimal impact to existing properties a strong zoning ordinance that protects and enhances the community is required  amended   concerning the rt one1 rt one2 rt one3 rt one4

wide range of goods services and attractions in keeping with the essential needs of yorks residents and tourists d route one4 tourismrecreation to establish an area where 1 uses that complement yorks prime economy as a familyoriented tourism area are encouraged  and 2 uses that promote the extension of public sewer to this section of route one are allowed e route one5 zone cape neddick village to establish an area where 1 the existing appearance and village character of the cape neddick area is promoted and which future development must satisfy  and 2 residential smallscale commercial office and restaurant uses can occur to create a village atmosphere f route one6 zone rural mixed use to establish an area where 1 the existing rural character of this area is protected by requiring most uses to retain existing trees as protective aesthetic buffers  and 2 a large variety of uses are permitted provided each use satisfies applicable standards  amended   concerning the shoreland overlay district the purposes of the shoreland overlay district are to further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions  to prevent and control water pollution  to protect fish spawning grounds aquatic life bird and other wildlife habitat  to protect buildings and lands from flooding and accelerated erosion  to protect archaeological and historic resources  to protect commercial fishing and maritime industries  to protect freshwater and coastal wetlands  to control building sites placement of structures and land uses  to conserve shore cover and visual as well as actual points of access

mitigate adverse impacts upon adjacent residential uses  2 to establish performance standards which serve public health safety and welfare objectives by regulating the sight distances from accesses to nonresidential properties the storage and disposal of waste explosive or toxic substances surface runoff and by visually buffering nonresidential uses and offstreet parking from adjacent resident uses  and 3 to achieve the above objectives while at the same time allowing for the general purpose uses of rural land as called for in the ordinance  concerning conversion of seasonal dwellings 1 to regulate the conversion of structures presently used as motels hotels private cottages and tourist or guest cottages into dwellings for which yearround use is designed or anticipated  2 to recognize that seasonal dwellings as originally designed or constructed generally do not meet the standards ordinarily applicable to residential dwellings  3 to recognize that while such nonconformance may be tolerable in dwellings that are used only periodically or by transient visitors the public health safety and welfare requires that such dwellings be upgraded if they are to be used on a yearround basis  and 4 consequently it is the intent of this ordinance that no seasonal dwelling be converted to a yearround dwelling unless the dwelling will conform to all land use regulations that would be applicable to that dwelling if it were being newlyconstructed as a yearround dwelling  concerning historic buildings and sites town of york zoning  11 1 to provide a legal framework within which the

with the character of the district  concerning open space conservation subdivisions as an alternative to conventional residential subdivision design the purpose of open space conservation subdivision design is to protect important components of the natural and cultural environment while encouraging quality residential neighborhood design the primary mechanism to accomplish this purpose is the reduction of individual lot sizes and dimensional standards with the balance of land set aside into a common open space there is an economic incentive to pursue open space conservation development by
