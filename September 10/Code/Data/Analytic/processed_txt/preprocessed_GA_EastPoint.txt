repealed the former ch 4  2400124030 and enacted a new ch 4 as set out herein the former ch 4 pertained to the same subject matter refer to table for complete derivation declaration of policy a our government is a representative democracy those who are elected appointed hired volunteer or campaign to serve the public as representatives accept a public trust which they share with those whom they elect appoint hire or otherwise enlist to help them serve the public the public entrusts its power and resources to its servants to use only in the public interest public trust requires public servants to fulfill their public duties faithfully and honestly and to subordinate any personal interest which conflicts with the public interest public trust also requires that government be conducted in an open manner when appropriate so that the official actions of public servants may be subject to public scrutiny and so that members of the public have access to information upon which decisions and policies affecting them are made  but public trust also requires that government be conducted in a manner which respects the rights of its constituents to privacy and confidentiality public trust also requires that acts which are contrary to the public interest be defined and prohibited  that there be an orderly procedure for raising and addressing ethical questions  that ethical behavior be encouraged and suitably rewarded  and that unethical behavior be discouraged and suitably disciplined process which is fundamentally fair b it is the responsibility of each public servant to act in a manner which contributes to cultivating public trust in the integrity of government public trust in the integrity of government is cultivated when individual public servants act with integrity and when the public is aware that its servants act with integrity therefore dedicated public servants not only act with integrity but also choose to avoid even lawful activity when the appearance of impropriety would lessen the publics confidence in the integrity of its servants and its system as a result sometimes public servants sacrifice opportunities which would be open to them if they were not public servants c most public servants strive to live by these standards most of the time but because sometimes some do not some formal policies are necessary in adopting these formal policies this community recognizes that 1 public servants are also members of society and therefore share the same general personal and economic interests in the decisions and policies of government as all members of the community do  and 2 public servants retain their rights to publicly express their views on matters of general public interest and to express their opinions on the effect of public actions on their personal or economic interests or rights  and 3 it is sound public policy for standards of ethical conduct for public servants to distinguish between those minor and inconsequential conflicts that are unavoidable in a free society and those conflicts which are personal material and avoidable  and 4 public servants are entitled to engage in employment professional or business activities other than official duties in order to support themselves and their families and to maintain a continuity of professional or business activity and are entitled to maintain investments  and 5 in this community it is possible and reasonable to require public servants to engage in employment professional or business activities and to maintain investments which do not impede or undermine the integrity of their service to the community d although this chapter is necessary to identify minimum standards below which a public servants conduct cannot fall without the risk of penalty it is understood that a healthy ethical environment for the provision of public service cannot be achieved or maintained by mere adherence to minimum standards therefore this chapter also requires that the community provide additional positive means of encouraging ethical behavior among its public servants it is also understood that no external activity can replace the internal commitment which motivates those who act ethically the principal policy which forms the foundation of this chapter is to encourage internal commitment by establishing and maintaining a work environment which supports integrity with pride and enthusiasm e a work environment which supports integrity includes public servants who 1 recognize with gratitude that the primary reason they hold a public position is to serve the public  and 2 recognize with pride that they hold their public position because the public trusts them  and 3 recognize with sadness that the publics trust in government and in them is diminished when any public servant acts unethically  and 4 recognize with hope that their public service is an opportunity to help restore public trust in their government  and 5 are fair and impartial but also courteous and enthusiastic in serving the public and each other in the performance of their duties  and 6 are adequately educated in the principles of ethics  and 7 are motivated to pursue ethical ideals which always exceed minimum standards and often achieve the highest standards  and 8 exemplify ethical conduct  and 9 encourage ethical practices which protect advance and promote the public interest  and 10 in speaking about the conduct of those in public service or in responding to others who speak about it express approval of positive ethical principles and behavior and refrain from unjustly disparaging or demeaning those who advocate ethical principles or practice ethical behavior  and 11 recognize that the most effective way to eradicate unethical practices is to consistently act ethically themselves and to consistently react appropriately with respect to the ethical decisions of those with whom they work  and 12 exercise sound and independent judgment to act ethically in situations where others around them may be inclined to act unethically  and 13 when they observe serious unethical practices promptly disclose them to appropriate authorities and encourage others to do the same  and 14 make and implement decisions and policies channels of the governmental organization  and 15 insure that those for whose performance they are responsible are aware of minimum standards of ethics below which their conduct cannot fall without the risk of disciplinary consequences  and 16 when unethical behavior has been determined by the board they will make the appropriate recommendation to the appropriate legal authority and the mayor and council  purposes of chapter this chapter is adopted a to state principles of ethics which are to be applied in public service  and b to identify minimum standards of ethical conduct for public servants  and c to require that public servants engage in ethical practices which always meet minimum standards  and d to encourage public servants to pursue the highest ethical ideals which they can achieve  and e to provide reasonable due process for public servants who are alleged to have violated this chapter  and f to provide an objective and fair process to identify and resolve ethical issues  and g to inform public servants and the public of the minimum standards to which public servants must adhere  and h to promote public confidence in the integrity of public servants  and i to encourage members of the public to seek public office or employment to serve on public boards to assist public servants as volunteers and to take pride in participating in the governmental process  and j to establish penalties as appropriate for public servants who violate the public trust  and k to

if a blaster decides that the table provided by the city is too conservative or limiting he may on 15 days notification to the department of mines and minerals use seismograph measurements and increase the charge per delay period provided the velocity of 2 inches per second limit is not violated he must use the seismograph on every shot thereafter so long as the table is not being complied with if the blaster decides to return to the use of the table he may do so by notifying the department 15 days in advance b if a blaster considers the table too limiting or too conservative for his particular area he may upon submission of seismograph reports petition for a modified table for blasting operation at that particular site but in no case shall the department allow a table that would permit velocities above the 2 inch per second limit c in making a seismograph determination of the velocity at a particular position the following formula shall be used v   v o d<inf>o<inf>  d 15

derived  adopted dec 20 2004 division 1  introduction findings the city council of the city of east point georgia makes the following findings a the professional engineering and financing analysis prepared by experts for the city properly assesses and defines the stormwater management problems needs goals program priorities and funding sources of the city b stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of east point while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of east point is consistent with the present and future needs of the community c the stormwater needs in the city of east point include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders andor results in both service and benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of east point in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses however the service and benefit rendered or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and programs and risk exposure d the city of east point presently owns operates and provides regulatory control regarding certain stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years and include features such as inlets conduits channels swales ditches drainage easements and other natural waterways the future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned andor operated andor regulated by the city and of additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities in east point in concert with the management of other water resources in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs e given the problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financing analyses it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems in east point in concert with other water resource management programs f the city council recognizes that lack of maintenance of a stormwater management system creates adverse conditions to both private and public elements of the management and conveyance system and to properties that are dependent upon such conveyances for effective management of stormwater runoff g the city council finds concludes and determines that a stormwater management utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly funding stormwater management services in the city of east point and implementing all of the citys stormwater managementrelated ordinances h an equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of service charges upon properties that is related to the burden of stormwater control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city such schedule of service charges can be complemented by other funding methods which address specific needs including but not limited to allocations of special purpose local options sales taxes to stormwater drainage improvement projects a service charge credit is an appropriate means of adjusting service charges in recognition that private stormwater systems andor actions can effectively reduce or eliminate the burden of stormwater quantity and quality control service requirements and costs that a property or properties pose for the city impervious area is the most important factor influencing stormwater service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city and therefore is an appropriate parameter for calculating stormwater service charges and associated credits in addition the value to the stormwater management utility of certain actions and practices performed by property owners and other stormwater management utility customers may be recognized by credits  121912 definitions bond shall mean an evidence of

intent of this article to regulate the place of operation of adult book stores as defined in this city council finds based upon an october 198 study by the minnesota crime prevention center inc minneapolis minnesota entitled an analysis of the relationship between adult entertainment establishments crime and housing values that adult book stores are significantly related to diminishing market values of neighboring residential uses that adult book stores should not be located in residential areas and that adult book stores should be permitted only in locations that are at least 110 mile or approximately 500 feet from residential areas the council further finds based upon a june 197 study by the division of planning of the st paul minnesota department of planning and economic development and the community crime prevention project of the minnesota crime control planning board entitled effects on surrounding area of adult entertainment businesses in saint paul that the presence of adult book stores correlates with a decreasing market value of neighboring residential areas that adult book stores tend to locate in areas of poorer residential condition tend to be followed by a relative worsening of the residential condition and that more than two adult entertainment businesses in an immediate area is associated with a statistically significant decrease in residential property market value and that such a concentration of adult entertainment businesses in a given area should be discouraged the council also finds that such worsening of residential conditions will adversely affect uses found in residential areas or in the proximity of residential areas such as public recreational facilities public or private institutional uses churches schools universities colleges tradeschools libraries and day care centers the council further finds based upon a  land use study conducted in austin texas that an adult book store within one block of a residential area decreases the market value of homes that adult book stores are considered a sign of decline by lenders making underwriters hesitant to approve the 9095 percent financing many home buyers require and that patrons of adult book stores tend to be from outside the immediate neighborhood in which the adult book store is located the council further finds based upon a  study conducted by the oklahoma city oklahoma community development department entitled adult entertainment businesses in oklahoma city  a survey of real estate appraisers that an adult bookstore will have a negative effect on residential property market values if it is located closer than one block to residential uses this section is intended to be a carefully tailored regulation to minimize the adverse land use impacts caused by the undesirable secondary effects of adult bookstores and the city council finds that restricting adult book stores to industrially zoned areas and imposing development standards can legitimately regulate adult book stores by establishing zones where adult book stores are most compatible with other uses or the surrounding neighborhood and by requiring minimum distances to be maintained between adult bookstore uses and other uses so as to afford the most protection to residential uses it is not the intent of the city council in enacting this amendment to the zoning ordinance to deny to any person rights to speech protected by the united states or georgia constitutions nor is it the intent to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials including sexually oriented films videotapes books or other materials  further in the adoption of this amendment to the zoning ordinance the city council does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the united states or georgia constitutions nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell distribute or exhibit such constitutionally protected materials  finally in the

of this subsection is to provide facilities that ensure safe pedestrian movement in the city of east point 2 intent sidewalks are intended to provide a safe pedestrian connection between the subdivisiondevelopment and nearby destinations pedestrians consist of children walking to and from school and neighborhood activities as well as adults walking to and from neighborhood shopping and transit stops in addition to the need for sidewalks for circulation and safety sidewalks can be important elements in the recreational system of this community they can also serve as walking and hiking trails b performance approach 1 performance factors the performance approach shall be applied in determining the need for sidewalks in this case the decision to require a development to provide sidewalks shall be made on a casebycase basis 2 several basic factors shall be used in applying the performance approach these are street classification and currentpotential future volume of pedestrian traffic  residential land usedevelopment density  relation to residential areas  proximity of schools school bus stops shopping areas  and proximity of parks libraries bike pathspedestrian trails greenspace corridors and other land uses a street classification and volume of pedestrian traffic as traffic volume and road speeds increase there is more need for separate pedestrian ways to ascertain safety sidewalks shall be provided along local streets collectors arterials and private roads b residential land use and development density i sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of all local streets and street frontages where the residential land use designation in the comprehensive plan is eight unitsunit per acre or higher density ii sidewalks shall be provided along at least one side of all local streets when the residential land use designation in the comprehensive plan is less than eight unitsunit per acre c relation to residential areas in general sidewalks are intended to be within the street rightofway this traditional location of sidewalks may be replaced in mixeduse developments by a flexible pedestrian circulation system such a system would connect individual dwelling units with other units offstreet parking open space system and recreational facilities also this system may be permitted to meander development within prescribed sidewalk easements if the sidewalk leaves the rightofway an easement and indemnification agreement must be provided for public access and maintenance d proximity of schools and shopping areas i sidewalks shall be required in subdivisions located within one mile from an existing or proposed school on both sides of any street that provides access to such school subdivisions at each side of the street shall provide sidewalks at the corresponding frontage ii sidewalks shall be provided within a distance of up to one mile along both sides of streets leading to or going areas e proximity of parks libraries

subsection sentence clause phrase or provision of these regulations article i  driveway regulations purpose this document is intended to clearly define the process of constructing a legal access point or any other work in the right of way of city roads in east point to accomplish this we are modifying sections three of the georgia department of transportation document regulations for driveway and encroachment control and adopting this modified version any variance to the standards set forth in this manual must be in the form of a written appeal to the director of public works along with the appropriate studies to support the variance request driveway spacing as drivers approach each intersection along a roadway they are often presented with decisions and may be required to stop or make various maneuvers when exiting the roadway it is necessary to decelerate and in some cases to change lanes it may also be necessary to adjust speeds in reaction to other vehicles entering into the arterial traffic stream driveways should be spaced so that drivers can perceive and react to the conditions at each intersection in succession spacing between driveways should be at least equal to the distance traveled at the posted speed limit during the normal perception and reaction time plus the distance traveled as the vehicle decelerates to a stop each intersection also requires a certain amount of storage space for vehicles waiting to enter the distance between intersections should be great enough to provide this storage allowing each intersection to have its functional boundary separated from those of the next intersection crash data also indicates that as the number of driveways along a roadway increases so do accident rates meeting the spacing criteria is not in itself an indication that driveways will be allowed guidelines for driveway spacing associated with the construction of new driveways are provided in table 31 driveways should be separated from any other facility which accesses a city roadway whether it is another driveway or a public street minimum spacing requirements also apply to driveways on the opposite side of undivided roadways requirements

apply to the distance between the two oneway driveways driveway pair a driveway pair must be separated from another driveway pair by the distance as shown in table 1 a driveway pair must also be separated from an adjacent twoway driveway in accordance with the spacing criteria in table 1 figure 1 spacing criteria for oneway driveways placement of driveways not only must driveways be spaced from other driveways as provided above they must also be located a minimum distance from the property line the radius return must be a minimum of 5 from the property line when driveways are to be jointly used by two or more property owners the property line separation requirements given in the above paragraph can be waived however a joint use agreement signed by the affected property owners must be provided to the access management engineer either property owner may apply for the driveway permit driveway spacing driveways should align with other driveways located on the opposite side of the roadway if offset driveways cannot be avoided the same driveway spacing criteria as given in table 1 should be provided to provide space for left turns figure 2 shows how the spacing is measured for locating offset driveways on undivided roadways spacing is from center to center figure 2 spacing of offset driveways if the city roadway involved is a divided facility and the driveways do not align with a median crossover the driveway spacing would only apply to the adjacent driveway located on the same side of the roadway as shown above in figure 2 residential driveways driveways serving single family residential homes or townhouses do not have to adhere to the standards set forth in the previous sections as they have a less significant impact than a new street or commercial driveway not more than two private curb cuts may be located on any one street frontage for any one dwelling when there are two curb cuts on any one street frontage there shall be a safety zone between the cuts not less than ten feet as measured along the curbline in no case shall the curb cut be less than five feet from the side property line as measured along the rightofway line the curb cut shall not encroach upon the radius of the curb at a street corner not more than one private curb cut may be located on any one street frontage for any one dwelling where the street is classified as a collector or higher order street if a lot has access to more than one frontage it may not have any private curb cuts on a street that is classified as a collector or higher order street if both frontages are classified as collector or higher order streets then the curb cut may be on the frontage with the lowest classification or as designated by the public works department spacing of median crossovers

that are likely to occur without the median opening meeting the spacing criteria is not in itself an indication that median openings will be allowed spacing of signalized intersections this section is provided to assist the applicants engineer in designing sites that may need signalized points of access to the city roadway table 3 contains guidelines for the spacing that should be provided between signalized intersections condition signal spacing in feet desirable minimum rural 2640 1320 urban 1320 1000 table 3 spacing of signalized intersections the spacing guidelines provided above are indicative of conditions that normally offer better signal progression for arterial traffic flow it is recognized that under certain conditions better operation may result from the introduction of signals with less spacing if the alternative forces high volumes of traffic to an adjacent intersection when the applicant can show alternatives analysis that better operations can be achieved with less spacing the department of public works will consider an exception to the provisions of table 3 design criteria the design of driveways shall comply with the guidelines of aashtos a policy on geometric design of highways and bridges current edition this manual provides a summary of the minimum design constraints that will be checked during the plan review process the geometric design of an intersection is a collection of various elements such as radius width grade angle of intersection etc that in combination provide for satisfactory operation of the vehicles that will use the intersection since the operating characteristics vary dramatically for different types of vehicles the designer must first establish the design vehicle on which to base the driveway design the designer should also check the final design to ensure the design vehicles can operate satisfactorily design for trucks the design criteria given in this chapter has more stringent requirements for trucks even though the general use of such guidance would result in more desirable operations for all vehicles it is neither practical nor necessary to design all facilities to accommodate trucks the designer must use judgment in selecting the proper design vehicle when semi trailer combination trucks are expected to use the intersection on a regular basis and in numbers more than just an occasional vehicle then the intersection should be designed to accommodate the truck movements this includes most driveways designed for industrial use and many commercial driveways for commercial uses such as shopping centers the preliminary site plan should indicate where heavy duty pavement would be provided to accommodate truck access to loading docks any driveway associated with accessegress for the loading docks should use the truck radii minor movement driveways particularly those that allow only right turns will generally only be used by passenger cars driveway width when traffic impact studies are required the driveway shall be designed to provide the number of lanes recommended in the study the findings within the study supersede the standards set forth in table 4 standard lane widths are 12 when the need for multiple lanes is not established from a traffic impact study the minimum and maximum driveway widths are as set forth in table 4 driveway use width in

median crossovers the detail has two types of designs see figure 3 that are applicable in different situations in east point type a median crossovers will not be permitted type b median crossover type b median crossovers are required when the projected volume of the left turn movement exceeds 50 vehicles per hour per direction andor when the median width is sufficient to offset the left turn lane from the adjacent this design provides better sight distance for vehicles in the left turn lane this is important for unsignalized intersections and when unprotected turns are allowed at signalized intersections type c median crossover type c median crossovers are typically used in urban areas where the median width is limited to approximately 24 feet or less with this type of crossover it may be necessary to add pavement to the opposite edge in order to accommodate uturns table 7 illustrates the minimum pavement width that is required for vehicles to make uturns the required width is given

requirements the sight distance criteria are based on the time required for a vehicle to make a left turn from a stopcontrolled approach to the city roadway aashto case b1 the time to execute the maneuver is based on recommendations contained in nchrp report 383 intersection sight distance the sight distances for a twolane road are the distances traveled at the arterial speed during 75 seconds the time is increased by 05 seconds for each additional lane to be crossed the sight distances given in table 8 are for undivided roadways if the roadway is divided the effect of the median should be considered in determining the required sight distance based on the conditions it may be feasible for the crossing maneuver to be done in two stages with a stop in the median however the intersection should only be treated in this manner if the signing and marking is accordingly provided otherwise the sight distance requirements should be increased to account for the additional width that must be crossed see aashto green book intersections for adjustments due to grades greater than three percent and design vehicles other than passenger cars horizontal alignment in general the horizontal alignment of driveways should be designed using a tangent section from the centerline of the city roadway and extending to the property line horizontal curves should be sufficient to provide safe operations at speeds that would normally occur in the areas where they are constructed angle of intersection intersecting driveways and roads should generally meet at or nearly at right angles driveways and roads intersecting at acute angles create sight limitations that should be avoided in some cases a more suitable overall design can be achieved by allowing intersecting angles other than

section provides the design guidelines that should be used to establish the lengths of turn lanes if they are required turn lanes should provide a fullwidth lane that is long enough to allow for vehicles to decelerate from the operating speed to a full stop in addition to the length of fullwidth lane that is needed to store vehicles waiting to turn table 11 contains guidelines for lengths of

minimum deceleration lane lengths when traffic studies are conducted the length of fullwidth lane needed for storage should be determined if the length of fullwidth storage is greater than the length of fullwidth storage shown in table 11 the longer length should be provided at signalized intersections the amount of storage for both right and left turns can be based on the number of vehicles arriving during 15 signal cycles for unsignalized intersections a commonly used rule of thumb is that left turn storage should accommodate vehicles arriving during a twominute period minimal storage is required for right turn lanes at unsignalized intersections minimum requirements for left turn lanes left turn lanes must be constructed at no cost to the city if either the adt or left turning

traffic engineer feels that field conditions or other factors indicate that it would be in the best interest of the city to waive the left turn lane requirement the director of public works must document the recommendations the recommendations shall be approved by the director of public works and be attached to the permit the director of public works may also require the addition of a right turn lane even when the conditions in table 12 are not met if roadway geometry or field conditions indicate that the safety of the traveling public would be improved the recommendation must be documented and approved by the director of public works for inclusion with the permit left turn lane design the design of left turn lanes should consider the intended function and the characteristics of the roadway in many cases it is necessary to widen the existing roadway to introduce the left turn lane all vehicles approaching the turn lane are shifted to the right the left turning traffic is then shifted back into the lane through traffic is returned to its original lane beyond the intersection when the roadway has a median that is at least 20 feet wide the left turn lane can be developed out of the median avoiding the need for transitions if a proposed driveway aligns across the main street with another driveway and the proposed driveway must provide a left turn lane and left turn storage then adequate storage and tapers must also be provided for the driveway across the main street the basic design elements of left turn lanes are illustrated in table 13 this example shows symmetrical widening which basically requires the on each side to shift by one half of the lane width some circumstances may dictate that all widening be achieved on one side which requires a full lane shift for on the side where the additional width is developed table 13 provides guidelines for selecting the proper length of approach taper posted speed limit mph approach taper in feet bay

prohibit undesirable movements define the paths of allowed movements and provide a refuge area for pedestrians any location where two outbound lanes are proposed for a driveway at an unsignalized location the right line must be for rightout only movement and separated from the other lane by a raised island painted lines are an effective means to direct the paths of vehicular movement however raised islands are more effective during times when visibility is reduced when islands are to serve as pedestrian refuge areas they should be constructed as raised islands all sign posts to be placed within concrete area must have hole structure the hole may be either formed drilled or sawed raised islands should be large enough to command attention and accommodate wheelchairs the smallest raised island should have an area of 50 square feet in urban areas and 75 square feet in rural areas however 100 square feet is desirable in both cases refer to revised ada standards when multiple crosswalks are required to pass the required size may exceed the 100 square feet mentioned above the additional area may be required to install wheelchair ramps as an alternate to ramps the pedestrian travel way can be slotted island remaining on the grade of the roadway figure 4 shows a typical design for a raised corner island at a twolane driveway this design uses a radius of 65 feet and provides an island of sufficient size for wheelchair ramps and level landings figure 4 also contains a median island along the driveway this drawing does not imply that median islands or corner islands are required for all driveways however large painted islands may not serve the intended channelization purpose and the type island to be used should be based on the actual circumstances of the site raised islands should be offset from the edge of the adjacent travel lane on all sides the amount of offset shall be a minimum of 18 inches as measured from the edge of the travel lane to the face of the curb when raised islands are adjacent to roadways with posted speed limits of 50 mph or greater the island shall be offset from the edge of the roadway by a minimum distance of ten feet figure 4 design of raised islands rightin rightout driveways raised islands are also typically used to channelize the movements at a driveway where only right turns are allowed the raised island is an effective means of preventing left turns all rightin rightout islands must have a radius that is 70 feet or a compound curve that approximates 70 feet rightin rightout driveways are not intended for truck traffic so the exit and entrance lanes must be 12 in width as measured from face of curb to face of curb the island must be constructed from mountable curb three inches vertical 45 degree face three inches flat to accommodate emergency vehicles the edge of the island should be offset 18 inches to 24 inches from the edge of the travel lane pavement design all construction within the right of way of surfaces intended for travel by motorized vehicles shall be paved the pavement specification of auxiliary lanes on city roadways shall be the georgia dot standard specifications for construction of roads and bridges or as designated in east point standards whichever is more restrictive new developments are required to widen the road along their frontage to a uniform lane width of 12 feet if the widened area is two feet or less in width a concrete subbase should be provided per the current standards the developer must then either pave the entire width of the road or mill to the centerline and pave to match the existing road any deviation from this standard requires a waiver from the director of public works or his designee pedestrian considerations when driveways are constructed in areas where pedestrian activity is not prohibited the design should adequately provide for pedestrian movement and interaction with vehicular traffic pedestrian features that should be considered include sidewalks crosswalks traffic control features and curb ramps are required the americans with disabilities act accessibility guidelines must be utilized where pedestrian traffic is expected figure 5 contains typical locations for curb cut ramps ramps are required at all pedestrian crosswalks where curb is constructed or replaced the required crosswalk detail is also shown in figure 5 see current gdot construction details for the appropriate treatment figure 5 typical crosswalk details clear zone requirements experience has shown that motorists occasionally run off the roadway and providing a traversable recovery area can lesson serious injury aashto publishes a roadside design guide that should be used as a reference when designing driveways table 15 provides the clear zone distances as

flatter than a 2860 foot radius do not require an adjusted clear zone right of way requirements in order to construct driveways it is often necessary to construct improvements to the city roadway these improvements typically include the addition of lanes along the city roadway such as a deceleration lane if sufficient right of way exists improvements to the city roadway may be permitted without the requirement of additional right of way in urban sections the right of way should be no closer than 14 feet from the face of curb along state routes and 11 from the face of curb along all city roads in rural sections the point located onehalf way up the back slope should be on or within the right of way line sufficient right of way should be donated to the city for the deceleration

flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 a floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity of flood waters debris or erosion potential floodways must remain free of encroachment to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights 3 flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management water quality streambank protection stream corridor protection wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas 4 effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize damage to private property  3 minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  and 4 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public 5 of the constitution of the state of georgia and a of the official georgia annotated have

in accordance with standards of the international society of arboriculture b if grading covers the trees with dust hose them off c do not randomly or incorrectly prune live branches so that equipment or structures can fit within the trees protected zone d do not strip the topsoil or remove the natural leaf mulch or material from beneath a protected tree e trees should be felled away from rather than into tree save areas f provide adequate mulching and water for trees that will be retained tree damage any tree designated on a tree protection plan to be saved which is damaged during construction or as a result of construction as determined by the department of planning and zoning shall be treated according to accepted standards of the national arborists association or replaced with a tree or trees equal to the tree density unit value of the tree removed however any specimen tree damaged as described above shall be replaced with trees equal to two times the unit value of the tree removed or damaged if a damaged specimen tree must be removed the area occupied by its drip line must remain in a pervious state a replacement plan for such area must be approved by the department of planning and zoning pruning a pruning shall not cause longterm health or structural problems and must be done in accordance with international society of arboriculture standards ansi a300 standards example the pruning cut should not be too large when compared to the growing point for instance a large cut on a 20 cm trunk down to a 15 cm branch should be fine but the same cut to the trunk down to a one cm twig or bud is considerably less ideal and should be avoided b topping or severe pruning is prohibited severe pruning seriously affects a trees food supply can scald the newly exposed outer bark make trees vulnerable to insect invasion stimulate the regrowth of dense upright branches below the pruning cut make the tree more vulnerable to wind damage disfigure the tree aesthetically and sometimes result in the death of the tree removal of specimen trees unless specifically exempted from the requirements of this no specimen tree as defined by this be removed except in accordance with this section a justification for removal any applicant proposing to remove a specimen trees regulated by this apply for a tree removal permit in addition to the requirements for tree removal permits specified by this the applicant shall provide a written explanation as to why the specimen trees cannot be retained on the site which shall include a description of all alternative site development plans considered by the applicant to avoid the removal of said specimen trees said written explanation shall at minimum include the following 1 consideration of whether any buildings or structures parking areas storm water facilities utilities driveways or other features of the proposed development can be relocated or designed to retain the specimen trees and the additional costs of such relocations or design if any 2 consideration of whether the land area consumed by the proposed development can be reduced via decked parking reduction of the footprint of a building or structure by increasing the height or number of stories placement of storm water facilities underground and other appropriate means to retain the specimen trees and the additional costs involved in such surface area consumption if any 3 consideration of whether the development proposal can be reduced in size scale or extent without jeopardizing the economic feasibility of the proposed development 4 the total estimated value of the development before approval and upon completion as proposed if approved 5 explanation must be written by a certified arborist b director of planning and zoning approval an application to remove a specimen tree shall require the approval of the director of planning and zoning the director of planning and zoning may also consult with the city engineer in determining the accuracy of cost estimates submitted in the applicants written analysis the director of planning and zoning may issue a permit to remove specimen trees after finding that one or more of the following conditions are met 1 the written analysis provides convincing evidence that alternative site and building designs have been considered by the applicant but would not result in retention of the specimen trees 2 the additional cost associated with developing the site or constructing buildings as redesigned or reducing the site area consumed to retain the specimen trees would be disproportional to the value of the specimen trees retained calculated at $10000 per tree density unit 3 retention of the specimen trees would result in a less than viable economic use of the subject property 4 if more than one specimen tree is proposed to be removed the site design results in the minimum number of specimen trees removed that are necessary to accommodate the proposed development 5 a variance to the dimensional requirements of the zoning ordinance may be an appropriate remedy to preserve a specimen tree where in the opinion of the director of planning and zoning one or more variances would enable a site and building design to be accomplished while saving one or more specimen trees and where the objectives of tree protection would outweigh the purposes of the zoning regulations that would be varied the director of planning and zoning may suggest an applicant apply for variances instead of proposing to remove one or more specimen trees a determination by the director of planning and zoning that one or more variances to the dimensional requirements of this not be appropriate may support a finding by the director of planning and zoning in favor of granting approval to remove one or more specimen trees 6 the request to remove a specimen tree or trees is reasonable considering the remaining specimen trees on the site that will be retained 7 the director of planning and zoning may apply any or all decision criteria for the removal of trees as specified in this director of planning and zoning may approve or deny an application for a tree removal permit based on the above referenced criteria the determination of the director of planning and zoning pursuant to this provision may be appealed to the planning and zoning commission c tree bank contribution when removal of a specimen trees is approved by the director of planning and zoning as a condition precedent to issuing said tree removal permit the project applicant shall contribute to the city of east point tree bank an amount of $22000 for each tree density unit of the specimen trees removed calculated on the basis of table 2 of this article in any case where a specimen tree was removed without or prior to a lawfully issued tree removal permit the amount contributed to the tree bank shall be $100000 per tree density unit of the specimen tree removed the tree removal permit shall not be issued nor shall the specimen trees be removed until funds are received for deposit in the city of east point tree bank d recompense contributions to the east point tree bank may be adjusted by recompense subject to the following criteria 1 credit based on the tree density units as specified in table 3 may be given for new trees planted on the subject site above and beyond the minimum site density requirement if approved by the planning and zoning staff 2 such newly planted trees shall be of a caliper of three inches or greater 3 in cases where the obligation is not fully reduced by recompensed trees the remaining obligation shall be deposited to the east point tree bank and calculated based on $22000 per density unit criteria for removal of trees this section is intended to guide the planning and zoning staff in considering whether nonspecimen trees shall be permitted to be removed at the discretion of the director of planning and zoning the provisions of this section may be used along with other criteria in determining whether specimen trees shall be permitted to be removed a tree removal shall be disallowed if soil erosion or runoff problems will result due to topography soil type or proximity to flood plain or river protection areas  or if the removal will substantially alter the existing soils adversely with regard to runoff and erosion information submitted by the city engineer or other environmental specialist may be used by the planning and zoning staff in such an evaluation b removal of nonspecimen trees from a site may be allowed at the discretion of the planning and zoning staff if 1 the tree is located in an area where a structure or improvement will be placed and the tree cannot be relocated on the site because of age species or size of tree 2 the tree is diseased or structurally unsound 3 the tree is injured andor poses an imminent danger 4 the tree interferes with existing utility service 5 the tree creates an unsafe vision clearance for vehicular movement establishment of the east point tree bank a there is hereby established an east point tree bank for the maintenance and disbursement of funds required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this ordinance b where it is determined by the director of planning and zoning that payment into the east point tree bank shall be required hereunder the required funds shall be paid to the east point tree bank prior to issuance of any related permit c funds maintained in the east point tree bank shall be administered by the department of finance pursuant to rules and regulations regarding said funds appeal procedure a any applicant who is aggrieved or affected by any decision of the of the department relating to the application of these regulations may file an appeal within 30 days of the decision with the planning and zoning commission director of the department of planning and zoning b appeals shall only be granted for errors of interpretation application or where the unique natural features of the site are such that it is impractical or impossible to apply the terms conditions or standards of these regulations resulting in an undue hardship to the property owner c any person aggrieved by an action of the planning and zoning commission as it relates to this appeal within 30 days to the superior court of fulton county georgia by writ of certiorari severability and conflicts should any article clause or provision of this ordinance be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid such action shall not affect the validity of the ordinance as a whole or any part hereof so declared to be invalid it being the intent of the city council that each article clause and provision hereof be severable appendix a density factor analysis a basic condition of this article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum tree density of 30 units per acre the term unit is an expression of basal area and is not synonymous with tree the minimum tree density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to development the density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved planting new trees or some combination of the two for density factor analysis the following formula shall apply sdf   edf + rdf where sdf site density factor   the minimum tree density required to be maintained on a developed site 30 units per acre edf existing density factor   density of existing trees to be preserved on a site rdf replacement density factor   density of new trees to be planted on a site procedure for calculating the required tree replacement step 1 calculate the site density factor sdf the sdf is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 30 example a 22 acre site has a sdf of 22 x 30   66 step 2 calculate the existing density factor edf the existing density factor edf is determined by converting the diameter breast height dbh of individual existing trees to density factor units as shown in the following table 2 these units are totaled to determine the edf for the site example a total of eight existing trees will remain on the 22 acre site in step 1 these existing trees include 3  14 pines 3  18 oaks 1  20 hickory 1  30 oak when converted to density factor units using table 1 on the following page we arrive at the following values for existing trees on the site dbh units x number of trees 14 48 x 3   144 18 57 x 3   171 20 60 x 1   60 36 84 x 1   84 459 units total the total units 459 is the edf existing density factor this is the density value of existing trees that will remain on the site step 3 calculate the replacement density factor rdf replacement density factor rdf is determined by subtracting the edf from the sdf example 66 sdf

tree bank signs purpose and findings a purpose the article is enacted for the following purposes 1 to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication  2 to maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the citys ability to attract sources of economic development  3 to improve pedestrian and traffic safety  4 to minimize the possible adverse effects of signs on nearby public and private property  and to enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign restrictions  5 to prevent the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the city  6 to protect the public health safety and general welfare  7 to restrict the continued existence of abandoned or nonconforming signs unless in compliance with the terms of this article and to eliminate over time all nonconforming signs  8 to ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign standards  and 9 to make it easy quick and economically efficient to apply for a sign permit b findings 1 the city finds that signs are a proper use of private property are a means of personal free expression and a necessary component of a commercial environment as such signs are entitled to the protection of the law in the absence of regulation however the number of such signs tends to proliferate with property owners desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes of signs leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted thoroughfares in addition the competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians and undermines the sign owners original purpose of presenting a clear message of its idea or identification of its premises 2 the city further finds that the regulation of the size height number and spacing of signs is necessary to protect the public safety to assure compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses to enhance the business and economy of the city to protect the public investment in the streets and highways to maintain the tranquil environment of residential areas to promote industry and commerce to eliminate visual clutter and blight to provide an aesthetically appealing environment and to provide for the orderly and reasonable display of signs for the benefit of all the citys citizens 3 the city further finds that there is a substantial difference between signs erected by public authority and signs erected by private citizens or businesses signs erected by public authority are virtually all erected for the purpose of maintaining the public safety either control of traffic or of such type signage as street signs which enable the traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are going as such with the exception of signs identifying government buildings virtually all government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes moreover their use in the public rightofway is necessary to ensure their visibility to the motoring public the city finds that public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street excavations even where signs serve a propriety purpose such as identifying markings on utility poles those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of benefiting the public generally of locations where there may be temporary losses of power 4 signs and other structures belonging to east point are exempt from this 5 the city further finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function for instance address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating addresses which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies subdivision signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls while such signage is often referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this ordinance whenever possible it is the intent of this ordinance to refer to signs unrelated to the content of the speech provided

findings it is hereby determined that 1 land development projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  2 land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters  3 the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety public and private property drinking water supplies recreation fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters  4 these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas the preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged use of incentives or credits the georgia greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits  5 localities in the state of georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution  6 therefore the city of east point has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes postconstruction soil erosion and sedimentation stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with postdevelopment stormwater runoff purpose and intent the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure safeguard the public health safety environment and general welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources this article seeks to meet that purpose following objectives 1 establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding streambank erosion nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable coordinate site design plans which include greenspace with the countys greenspace protection plan  6 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained and pose no threat to public safety  and 7 establish
