investigation eminent domain  191 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to state that it is the public policy of the borough of norwood that the mayor and council will not use the power of eminent domain granted to the borough by statute or otherwise to acquire private property against the wishes of the property owner for private development merely to increase tax ratables or tax revenue derived from the property and that this power only will be used to acquire private property 1 when the property is to be opened to the public or for the publics use  or 2 when the acquisition is necessary to eliminate an existing use of the property that inflicts an affirmative harm on society the mayor and council adopts this section because on  the united states supreme court decided the case of kelo v city of new london 125 s ct 2655 2005 the courts 5 to 4 majority affirmed the use of the governmental power to condemn property known as the power of eminent domain to acquire

the alternate contact person if so designated by the grievant  187 eminent domain  191  because the proposed redevelopment will provide increased tax revenue the principal dissenting opinion authored by justice sandra day oconnor would permit governments to condemn and then transfer condemned property to private parties in only two circumstances when as with railroads the property is to be opened to the publics use or when the condemnation is necessary to eliminate an existing use of the property that inflicts affirmative harm on society accordingly the mayor and council seeks to do all that it can under the law to limit the boroughs power to condemn and acquire property as suggested by the dissenting justices in the kelo case  192 definitions in this chapter the following definitions
