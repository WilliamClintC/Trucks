the townships certification as eligible for federal flood insurance and to comply with the pennsylvania flood plain management act of 197 it is the intent of this district to provide adequate protection for floodprone properties within upper providence c in advancing these principles and the general purpose of this chapter and the comprehensive plan the following shall be the specific objectives of the floodplain conservation district 1 to combine with present zoning requirements certain restrictions made necessary for floodprone areas to promote the general health welfare and safety of the township 2 to prevent the erection of structures in areas unfit for human usage by reason of danger from flooding unsanitary conditions or other hazard 3 to minimize the danger to public health by protecting the quality and quantity of surface and subsurface water supplies adjacent to and underlying flood hazard areas and promoting safe and sanitary drainage 4 to permit only those uses which can be appropriately located in the floodplain as herein defined and which will not impede the flow or 132 editors note see 32 ps   et seq  18225 water  18225   18226 definition and establishment of district storage of floodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at above or below their locations along the floodplain 5 to protect those individuals who might choose despite the flood dangers to develop or occupy land on a floodplain 6 to protect adjacent landowners and those both upstream and downstream from damages resulting from development within a floodplain and the consequent obstruction or increase in flow of floodwaters 7 to protect the entire township from individual uses of land which may have effect upon subsequent expenditures for public works and disaster relief and adversely affect the economic wellbeing of the township 8 to maintain the undisturbed ecological balance between those natural systems elements including wildlife vegetation and marine life dependent upon watercourses and water areas 9 to protect other municipalities within the same watershed from the impact of improper development and the consequent increased potential for flooding 10 to provide areas for the deposition of floodborne sediment 11 to require that uses vulnerable to floods be developed so as to be protected from flood damage in accordance with the

comprehensive plan the open space and recreation plan the open space and environmental resource protection plan and this chapter the following specific objectives are intended to be accomplished by the adoption of the steep slope conservation district a to combine with other zoning requirements as an overlay certain restrictions for steep slope areas to promote the general health safety and welfare of the residents of upper providence township b to prevent inappropriate development of steep slope areas in order to avoid potential dangers for human usage caused by erosion stream siltation

life andor property e to permit only those uses in steep slope areas that are compatible with the preservation of existing natural features including vegetative cover by restricting the grading of steep slope areas f to promote the ecological balance among those natural system elements such as wildlife vegetation and aquatic life that could be adversely affected by inappropriate development of steep slope areas g to prevent development that would cause excessive erosion and a resultant reduction in the watercarrying capacity of the watercourses which flow around the township with the consequences of increased flood crests and flood hazards within the township and to both upriver and downriver municipalities h to protect individuals and adjacent landowners in the township andor
