repair a the design of any development shall provide for the maximum use of open channels and natural streams for flows and detention or retention storage of volumes and flows in excess of those present prior to development b drainage channel improvements shall be developed and designed that preserve and protect large trees and other worthy botanical and geological features to the greatest possible extent c wherever channel improvements are required to accommodate calculated flows in a specified manner the designs shall provide maximum utilization of turf sodding and other natural drainage techniques 2 closed underground drainage conduits shall be employed only when there is no viable alternative to fit site or geographic conditions or to meet the requirements of this chapter and all specifications and performance standards pertaining thereto 3 the rate of runoff after development shall not exceed that rate experienced before development a in no case shall the release rate of stormwater runoff from all developments in a drainage area controlled or uncontrolled exceed the safe storm drainage capacity of the downstream outlet channels or storm drainage system as determined by the city b within already developing or developed areas where safe storm drainage capacity of a downstream outlet channels or storm drainage system has been exceeded the developer shall add no increased runoff unless the downstream outlet capacity has been increased to accommodate all flows c improvements may be required in channels or sewers flowing into from the subdivision or development or in  1943 el reno code  1943 c318 channels or sewers located upstream or downstream that are affected by the flow of water from the subdivision development or change thereto the

development or property improvements will result in an increased runoff beyond the boundaries of the development or improvement which cannot be accommodated improvements without flooding or potential flooding upstream or downstream the city or the planning commission shall require the construction of one or more detention or retention facilities on the subdivision or property being improved andor required detention or retention techniques to be used offsite which will result in flows during construction and thereafter from the property at a rate and volume no greater than the discharge from the undeveloped site 4 all those engaged in land improvements or modifications shall prevent the erosion of soil and movement of sedimentation into onto or gutters catch basins culverts or other drainage channels and shall prevent erosion as a result of flows from streets gutters culverts or other drainage channels a where it can be demonstrated that there is no alternative to rapid runoff

development act 17 os  16011 et seq as may be amended from time to time a purpose the purpose of establishing guidelines for streets avenues and highways is to provide for safe and efficient operation of public roadways road users have the right to travel on a street with relative safety and freedom from unreasonable delays due to traffic interference interference is generally the result of vehicles entering leaving or crossing at intersecting streets or driveways traffic safety depends on proper site design and traffic controls to minimize accidents and assure the best overall use of the road by citizens it is necessary to regulate traffic on all public streets including the ingress to and egress from public and private properties b authority the city of el reno has jurisdiction over public thoroughfares and is given responsibility in regards to driveway location design and operation property owners have certain rights of access to abutting streets when conflicts of interest between motorists and property owners cannot be resolved to a reasonable degree preference should be given to the safe and efficient use of the street after the property owners minimum rights of ingress and egress have been addressed c definitions as used in this section the following terms shall have the meanings indicated curb radius  governed by the paths that vehicles follow when making turns the minimum radius possible is used to reduce the amount of area required for a driveway large vehicles must swing into adjacent lanes if the curb radius is too small the radius starts at the point of curvature on the street curbline  36130 el reno code  36131 c844 driveway types  fire lanes from the fire department  a hardsurface allweather road to provide access for fire apparatus these lanes must be constructed of concrete or asphalt and must be at least 15 feet in width with the road edge closest to the building but no closer than 10 feet from the structure fires lanes are mandated for any building exceeding 4000 square feet in gross floor area fire lanes shall not dead end unless provided with a culdesac at the end with a diameter of not less than 90 feet highvolume versus lowvolume driveway  a lowvolume driveway creates relatively little conflict on the adjoining street a highvolume driveway can create severe interference on an adjoining street a highvolume driveway can create severe interference on an adjoining street with certain movements  such as the leftturn entry in the absence of an exclusive leftturn lane another movement which is sensitive to the spacing of driveways relative to the nearest traffic control on the abutting streets is the leftturn exit movement such movements are also relatively hazardous due to the potential for accidents with oncoming traffic the rightturn entry into a driveway is the second most sensitive movement this movement can also impede traffic a highvolume driveway is defined as a drive with a peakhour volume either into or out of the drive which exceeds 100 vehicles per hour state or us highway  roadways designated as state or federal highways require application for direct access state of oklahoma department of transportation with the consent of the city of el reno street classification  the street system is classified into groups of facilities whose traffic purposes complement one another and can be residential  a driveway providing access to a singlefamily residence duplex or an apartment building containing fewer than four dwelling units 1 commercial  a driveway that provides access to a school office retail or institutional property or a residential multifamily dwelling that has four or more dwelling units heavy trucks usually serve such sites as an incidental use but these driveways typically provide access for heavy automobile and lightduty truck traffic driveways that serve administrative employee or customer parking at industrial sites are also considered commercial applications 2 industrial  a driveway that directly serves substantial heavy truck traffic to and from loading docks of an industrial facility a shopping center or any other retail facility where heavy deliveries are received should have at least one driveway specifically designed to accommodate such traffic as well 3  36131 charter  36131 c845 thought of as a hierarchy of network relationships within the overall transportation system see comprehensive plan urban area  an area is defined as urban if the developed area is within the el reno city limits and is designated as either existing or future urban area by the comprehensive plan see development timing freeway  a multilane divided highway having a minimum of two lanes for exclusive use of traffic in either direction and full control of ingress and egress a freeway provides the highest level of mobility along the street categories and is not intended to for direct land access access and egress is provided by an integrated system of ramps example interstate 40 1 primary arterial  serves principally as a route for is used for accessing abutting properties as a secondary function arterials provide continuity of several miles generally connecting with intercity routes and providing a system to distribute traffic from the freeway system example us 81 and sh 66 2 secondary arterial  streets that augment the primary arterial system and provide a lower level of mobility and distribute traffic to smaller geographic areas these streets are typically section line roads examples s country club road shepard road foreman road elm street and 27th street 3 commercial and industrial collector  surface streets that provide land access and traffic circulations service within commercial and industrial areas these collectors are designed to handle traffic volumes loading to and from local and arterial streets 4 residential collector  designed to carry traffic volumes traveling to and from local and arterial streets these are usually continuous for two miles or less with stop signs being used as the primary traffic control devices back out drives should be minimized 5 local street  provides direct access to residential commercial or other abutting property uses through traffic should be discouraged as the local street must he designed for the safety of all road users local streets should not carry more than 1500 daily trips 6 d administration 1 access to any public street within city limits requires a written driveway permit approved by the community development director or designees  36131 el reno code  36131 c846 2 application for driveway permits shall be submitted to the community development department and driveway permits may be applied for at the time a building permit application is submitted plans shall meet all criteria established by the department for obtaining a building permit and shall be specific to the types of materials to be utilized in constructing any improvements within the rightofway 3 any approach onto a state highway must first be reviewed by the community development department before being submitted to the oklahoma department of transportation once the application has state approval a permit will then be issued by the community development department 4 the cost of the driveway permit will be established by city council 5 all driveways abutting public streets must be inspected a all initial inspections must be requested community development department at least before  noon on the day that they are needed a reinspection fee will be charged should the job not be ready within 15 minutes of the time requested b initial inspections will consist of inspecting the driveways base curb and driveway forms c a final inspection shall be called for once the concrete is installed e driveway design and construction requirements the fewer driveways present on an urban street the more effectively the street will serve its crucial function of moving traffic spacing between driveways and intersections should be appropriate to the character of the driveway and street these design guidelines should be used recognizing that the community development department may need to adapt requirements for a particular driveway based on traffic conditions 1 driveway to intersection separation a separation requirements shall be based on the following configuration contiguous frontage owned feet driveways allowed 0 to 200 1 201 to 500 2 501 to 900 3  36131 charter  36131 c847 contiguous frontage owned feet driveways allowed note an additional driveway shall be allowed for each 250 feet or portion thereof in excess of 900 feet b driveway spacing should be allowed to allow reasonable deceleration of vehicles approaching on the street and acceleration by vehicles entering the street median breaks for driveways should not be considered unless there is there is a highoccupancy application such as a major office building shopping center or industrial site that would create a significant traffic count median breaks must be approved by the public safety committee city engineer and public works director and should be located so that traffic signal progression patterns are not disrupted c the city of el reno requires that adjacent commercial industrial or institutional properties interconnect parking lots to provide a fire lane easement if such properties are granted two or more driveways and the adjacent property owners have interconnected parking lots then the developed properties must connect parking lots at a grade that allows for automobile traffic to traverse between the two properties at a width that conforms to this section additional

established in order to achieve among others the following purposes a to promote the most desirable and beneficial use of the land and structures in accordance with the objectives of the city of el reno comprehensive plan  b to provide appropriate and convenient districts of sufficient size to carry on research manufacturing processes and distribution activities to serve the community thereby promoting employment and strengthening the economy of the community  c to improve the industrial environment by discouraging unrelated and incompatible uses in such areas thereby making land more readily available for industry  d to protect adjacent residential districts by restricting types of industrial and manufacturing uses nearby to only those which will not create objectionable influences beyond their district boundaries and will be properly buffered and screened  e to protect industrial and related development against congestion by requiring setbacks and limiting the bulk and density of development in relation to adjacent buildings and available land and by requiring sufficient offstreet parking and loading facilities  f to carry out the following specific purposes 1 to provide an i1 light industrial district for industries which by their nature do not create nuisances the intent is to preserve this land for industry in a location beneficial to industries and to prohibit nonindustrial uses these industrial uses may require good accessibility to air rail or street transportation routes but the size andor volume of the raw materials and finished products should not be as great as that produced by uses in the moderate and heavy industrial districts 2 to provide i2 moderate industrial districts primarily for the conduct of light manufacturing assembly and fabrication and for warehousing wholesale and service uses which may generate 220 editors note the commercialindustrial setbacks diagram is on file in the city offices  36167 charter  36167 c921

industrial uses permitted may require good accessibility to air rail or street transportation routes but do not depend heavily on frequent personal visits of customers or clients provision is also made for outdoor operation and storage 3 to provide i3 heavy industrial districts for industrial and other uses that by virtue of their necessity for open spaces and impermanent structures as well as their external impacts such as noise dust truck andor rail traffic and impact upon the environment should be isolated from residential and commercial uses until reclamation plans are implemented such uses typically are intensive industrial establishments that utilize products materials andor processes which may involve dust smoke fumes glare odors or other objectionable characteristics but which use of greater separation between industries do not create any danger to the health safety and general welfare of the surrounding neighborhoods uses in the i3 district typically generate outdoor
