communities this council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities 2 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or rooms for viewing films videos or live sexually oriented entertainment such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases such as syphilis gonorrhea and human immunodeficiency virus hiv 3 offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage such activities creates unhealthy conditions 4 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because of the failure of owners and operators to regulate those activities and maintain their facilities 5 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view sexually oriented films 6 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 5 raise substantial governmental concerns 7 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 8 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on operators to see that sexually oriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business and fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 9 removal of doors on viewing booths in sexually oriented businesses and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with viewing booths will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult arcades and theaters and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial citys interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 10 requiring sufficient lighting in all sexually oriented businesses will advance the substantial governmental interest in curbing illegal sexual activity on the premises of sexually oriented businesses and will facilitate enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal state and local laws thereby furthering the substantial citys interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 11 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of sexually oriented businesses and by employees of such businesses will facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this article and other federal state and local laws and will thereby further the substantial citys interest in protecting the public health safety and welfare 12 a person who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a sexually oriented business 13 barring such individuals from the management of and employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 25  i1 71100  21  i1 32205 definitions for the purpose of this article the following terms shall have the following meanings adult arcade shall

government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the mayor and city council of the city of jackson does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations 32  1 51214 findings of fact a the city of jackson is subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions both inside and outside the identified special flood hazard areas causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 32  1 51214 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 32  1 51214 objectives the objectives of this article are 1 to protect human life and health  2 to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas 7 to ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area 32  1 51214 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article includes methods and provisions for 1 restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  and 2 requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  and 3 controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  and 4 controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas 32  1 51214 division 2  definitions definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used

first cigarette and almost 1500 children under 18 years of age begin smoking daily  more than 75 percent of all current smokers in 2001 began smoking before the age of 18  3 tobacco companies sell products that are addictive and inherently dangerous causing cancer heart disease and other serious illnesses  4 the city of jackson has a substantial interest in reducing the number of individuals of all ages who use cigarettes and other tobacco products and a particular interest in protecting adolescents from tobacco dependence and the illnesses and premature death associated with tobacco use  5 an overwhelming majority of americans who use tobacco products begin using such products while they are adolescents and become addicted to those products before reaching the age of 18  6 tobacco paraphernalia displays lead juveniles to develop favorable beliefs about tobacco use overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use and engage in illegal purchases of tobacco products or paraphernalia  7 the display of tobacco paraphernalia plays a crucial role in the decision of individuals and adolescents in particular to begin using tobacco products  8 the world health organization has endorsed a ban on retail tobacco product displays as an effective method of reducing tobacco use  9 research suggests that preventing the display of tobacco products will lead to a significant decrease in the number of adolescents becoming addicted to those tobacco products and will assist individuals in their efforts to quit smoking  10 the center for disease control recognizes that a comprehensive

of mississippi each year  16 preventing the display of tobacco products or paraphernalia will reduce the number of adolescents who use tobacco products while still affording tobacco companies numerous ways to communicate product information and provide other advertising to their legal adult customers  17 jackson city council desires to reduce adolescent smoking and the public health consequences of smoking without prohibiting the sale of tobacco paraphernalia to adult consumers  18 the purpose of this legislation is to further the strong governmental interest in protecting the health of its citizens and particularly its children by restricting the display of tobacco paraphernalia in retail environments that are open to children  and 19 this measure does not restrict expressive conduct

growing number of products the food and drug administration has announced that it will investigate the safety of caffeine in food products particularly its effects on children and adolescents b the food and drug administration fda has cited 400 milligrams a day as a safe amount of daily caffeine for healthy adults however the food and drug administration has not set a level for children c food and drug administration deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine michael r taylor has stated that the agency is concerned about children and adolescents and the responsibility fda and the food industry have to protect public health and respect social norms that suggest that stimulants such as caffeine should not be marketed to children d the american academy of pediatrics discourages the consumption of caffeine and other stimulants by children and adolescents e the fda advises consumers to avoid powdered pure caffeine as pure caffeine products are potentially dangerous and serious adverse events can result including death pure caffeine is a powerful stimulant and very small amounts may cause accidental overdose the fda further advised that people with preexisting heart conditions should not use them f several deaths due to caffeine overdose have involved teens and young adults noah smith a 17yearold from yalobusha county mississippi overdosed from caffeine pills

dietary supplement manufacturers and distributors are not required to obtain approval from fda before marketing dietary supplements l caffeine is generally recognized as safe dietary ingredients the active ingredients in dietary supplements require no fda preapproval to be used in a dietary supplement and the federal food drug and cosmetic act ffdca requires fda to prove that a product is unsafe under the conditions of use suggested in the labeling in order to take the product off the market m a food additive cannot be used in a conventional food unless it has been approved for that use by fda however substances that are generally recognized as safe by qualified experts are not considered to be food additives and can therefore be added to conventional foods without preapproval from fda n manufacturers packers and distributors of dietary supplements are required by law to report any serious adverse events to the fda within 15 business days and to provide also within 15 business days any additional medical information they obtain within a year of the adverse event report however the ffdca does not require manufacturers packers or distributors of conventional foods to report serious adverse events to fda therefore all adverse event reports that fda has received in connection with these products are voluntary o manufacturers can add it to products if they decide it meets the relevant safety standards and if they include it on the ingredient list while various uses may meet federal food safety standards the only time fda explicitly approved adding caffeine was for colas in the 1950s existing rules never anticipated the current proliferation of caffeinated products p labeling requirements for beverages and other conventional foods differ from those for dietary supplements for example beverages and other conventional foods are required to bear nutrition information in the form of nutrition facts rather than supplement facts and all ingredients in a beverage and other conventional food must be declared in the ingredient statement by their common and usual names in descending order of predominance q a review of scientific reports and articles reveals that

interest in controlling the erection location and maintenance of signs in a manner to protect the public health safety and morals and to promote the public welfare  2 that the increased number and size of such signs coupled with the increased use of motor vehicles make it imperative that the public streets and highways be kept free from signs which detract from traffic safety by diverting drivers attention away from the flow of traffic  3 that the number size and height of signs both building and ground mounted in the city is excessive is unduly distracting and confusing to motorists and pedestrians creates a traffic hazard and reduces the effectiveness of signs needed to direct the public  4 that the appearance of the city particularly that of its residential and light commercial districts is marred by the excessive number of signs  5 that the aforementioned effects detract from the pleasure safety and economic well being of the community and that the number of distracting commercial signs ought to be reduced in order to lessen the detrimental effects 6 that the size and location of such signs may if uncontrolled constitute an obstacle to effective firefighting techniques  7 that in addition thereto the construction erection and maintenance of large signs suspended from or erection placed on top of buildings walls or other structures constitute a direct danger to pedestrian traffic below such signs especially during periods when winds of high velocity are prevalent  8 that the natural beauty of landscape view and attractive surroundings of the city constitute an attraction for tourists and visitors  9 that the indiscriminate erection and maintenance of large andor numerous signs seriously detract from the enjoyment and pleasure of the natural scenic beauty of the city which in turn injuriously affect the tourist trade and thereby the economic wellbeing of the city  10 that portable signs generally create a higher degree of danger and distraction to the public are less attractive aesthetically are more difficult to monitor and regulate are mores susceptible to abuse and therefore should be prohibited  11 that due to technological advances in the outdoor advertising industry digital electronic signs have been introduced to the city and are in need of strict regulation  12 that for the promotion and preservation of the public health safety and welfare of the people of the city it is deemed necessary that the erection construction location maintenance and type of signs be regulated and controlled  and 13 that the regulations contained in this article are the minimum amount of regulation necessary to achieve its purposes 26  3 61003  6  1 82807 definitions for the purpose of this article the following terms

definitions 1 administrative penalties an administrative penalty is a monetary penalty assessed by the director or his designee for violations of article ii sewage disposal standards including but not limited to the fog program violations of the stormwater quality protection ordinance sections 122301 chapter 106 solid waste sections 1061 administrative penalties are to be used as an escalated enforcement action and are not related to a specific cost borne by the director or his designee instead the amount of the penalty should recapture any economic benefit gained by noncompliance andor deter future violations an administrative order is to be used to assess an administrative penalty 2 administrative orders ao administrative orders are to be issued by the director or the directors designee administrative orders are enforcement documents that direct users to undertake andor to cease specified activities administrative orders are to be used as the first formal response to significant noncompliance and may incorporate compliance schedules administrative penalties assessments for costs incurred during investigation andor enforcement attorneys fees assessments for damages and termination of service the department has adopted three general types of aos compliance orders cease and desist orders and agreed orders a compliance order a compliance order directs the user to achieve or restore compliance by a specified date and is the primary means of assessing penalties and costs the compliance order will document the noncompliance and state required actions to be accomplished by specific dates and is issued by the director or his designee b cease and desist order a cease and desist order directs the noncompliant user to cease illegal or unauthorized discharge immediately or to terminate discharge altogether to preserve the usefulness of this order in emergency situations penalties should not be assessed in this document a cease and desist order will be used in situations where the discharge is causing interference pass environmental harm or otherwise creating an emergency situation the order may be issued immediately upon discovery of an emergency situation or following a hearing in an emergency the order to cease and desist may be given by telephone with a subsequent written order to be served by the director or his designee before the close of business on the next working day if the user fails to comply with the order the director or his designee may take independent action to halt the discharge c agreed order the agreed order is an agreement between the department and the user the agreed order normally contains three elements 1 compliance schedules with specific milestone dates  2 stipulated penalties damages andor remedial actions  and 3 signature by the director and the user representative an agreed order is appropriate when the user assumes the responsibility for its noncompliance and is willing in good faith to correct the causes 3 noncompliance notification ncn the noncompliance notification ncn is a notification to the user that a practice an action or wastewater discharge is noncompliant with department regulations or policies a ncn informs the user that an action is required of the user within a specified time period designated by the director or their designee or the noncompliance will require the director to escalate enforcement action against the user 4 notice of violation nov the notice of violation nov is an official communication from the director to the noncompliant user that informs the user that a violation has occurred the nov is issued for relatively minor or infrequent violations of standards and requirements and should be issued within five working days of the identification of a violation an nov does not contain assessment of penalties or cost recovery the nov provides the regulated entity with an opportunity to correct the noncompliance on its own initiative rather than according to a schedule of actions determined by the director the nov documents the initial attempts of the department to resolve the noncompliance authenticated copies of novs may serve as evidence in judicial proceedings 5 schedule of compliance a schedule of compliance is a detailed list of steps to be taken by a noncompliant user whereby compliance with all pertinent regulations will be achieved this schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional gcd or other facilities required for the regulated entity to meet the applicable standards and requirements eg hiring an engineer completing preliminary plans executing contracts for components commencing construction etc b penalty assessment the city has categorized the various types of violations of the fog control program and assigned a penalty range to each category penalty categories are determined by using the enforcement response guide which is included in the fog control plan manual all penalty assessments will be approved and signed by the director or the directors designee penalty amounts determined are considered to be an economic deterrent to the noncompliance being addressed penalty ranges have been designed to recover any economic benefit gained by the violation violations of other environmental ordinances subject to this division shall be assessed consistent with the penalties provided in those ordinances the ranges of penalties for any violation of the requirements and standards for the fog control program shall be as follows category 0 no penalty category 1 $20000 to $50000 category 2 $50000 to $100000 category 3 $100000 to $1000000 category 4 direct legal action assessments for damages or destruction of the facilities of the potw and any penalties costs and attorneys fees incurred by the city as the result of the illegal activity as well as the expenses involved in enforcement are not part of this penalty assessment procedure 8  4 22718 emergency suspension of services the city may suspend water or wastewater service when such suspension is necessary and without prior notice when in the opinion of the director of the department of public works one of the following situations occurs with respect to the fog control program 1 three notices of violation of the fog control program have occurred within a 12month period 2 there is imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons or the environment 3 stoppages or sanitary sewer overflows have occurred or excessive maintenance has to be performed to prevent stoppages or overflows in the sanitary sewer collection system 4 interference occurs with

the editors discretion and with the citys approval findings a for several decades the city of jackson has conducted numerous disparity and availability studies that have documented the discriminatory practices and barriers to public procurement within the city of jackson that have plagued minority business enterprises and women business enterprises b historical systemic and institutionalized discrimination against minority and women owned businesses exists in the jackson business sector which has restricted their access to private and public contracting markets and which has emerged as the major factor responsible for their marginal economic position in the jackson business population c the specific industries that showed discrimination against women and other minorities include construction commodity sales and professional services d the contracting and procurement practices of the city of jackson prior to the inception of a minority and female business enterprise program were dominated by an historical institutional and systematic network from which women and minorities were excluded e market place discrimination against minorities and women business owners occurred in the jackson marketplace across a wide range of businesses including evidence of double standards in work appraisals denials of opportunities to bid discrimination in bonding financing and in payments lack of access to contracts unnecessarily restrictive specifications the existence of and the exclusion from the historical systematic and institutional network subcontracting bid shopping and bid manipulation f the statistical comparison suggested by the us supreme court in croson between the number of available qualified minority businesses and the total contract dollar awards going to minority businesses referred to as the utilization percentage ratio upr yields significant statistical disparities in all industries between majority and minority businesses who contract with the city of jackson moreover this comparison suggested by the court although showing a significant degree of disparity results in a deficient measure of discrimination failing to take into account those minority or female individuals or firms who were discouraged deterred andor disadvantaged by the discriminating practice in the marketplace g race and gender neutral policies including those suggested by the us supreme court in croson although helpful in improving minority and women owned business development are found to be inadequate standing alone to eliminate discriminatory practices which continue to deny women and minority business owners access to public and private contracts in the jackson marketplace h women and minorities have been discriminated against in public and private markets for contractual services there is a presence of discrimination in jackson in various industry classifications and by employer status which has persisted over time moreover there is strong anecdotal and statistical evidence that african american businesses continue to suffer the effects of past and present discrimination in the jackson business markets both public and private i female african american and other minority owned businesses continue to suffer discrimination in the local business market when competing for construction contracts given the strikingly low participation of minority enterprises in private construction markets the city of jackson should leverage behavior in the private market to assure the effective development of minority and female business enterprises and to eradicate discriminatory practices j the city of jackson was a passive participant in discriminatory practices in both public and the private commercial markets k past and present discrimination in public and private markets for contractual services and the inability of race and genderconscious programs standing alone make race and genderconscious programs necessary in order to remedy economic disparities between minority female and majority contractors l utilization goals attainable by good faith efforts not quotas for africanamerican female hispanic and asian american owned businesses are necessary to mitigate the competitive disadvantages which are caused by discrimination and are justified by evidence in the record 3 71415 definitions the following words terms
