eviction  purchase  benefits  assistance and punishment  condominium review board a preamble whereas a serious public emergency exists with respect to the housing of a substantial number of citizens of new bedford  and whereas the deterioration and demolition of existing housing and an insufficient supply of new rental housing have resulted in a substantial and critical shortage of safe decent and reasonable priced rental housing accommodations  and whereas the prolonged increases in housing costs at a rate substantially exceeding increases in personal income the increased costs of new housing construction and the conversion of multiple unit rental housing accommodations occupied by tenants to condominium units and cooperatives has resulted in a substantial and critical shortage of safe decent and reasonably priced housing accommodations  and whereas home ownership creates an interest in real estate which tends to contribute to the maintenance and preservation of housing and to an increase in real estate taxes which has a salutary effect on the city and its people and the city council should therefore encourage an increase in such ownership or at least should avoid discouraging it  and whereas at present in the city there is a great interest in and a significant amount of conversions of multiple unit rental housing occupied by tenants to condominium units or cooperatives occupied by individual owners thereof  and whereas notwithstanding the general good accomplished by such increase in home ownership many people of limited means particularly the elderly the handicapped and persons and families of low and moderate income are suffering thereby in that they have difficulty in obtaining alternative rental housing at prices which they can afford when evicted for condominium conversion  and whereas the untoward effects of condominium conversion evictions on tenants can be adequately dealt with by providing potentially displaced tenants with sufficient time to examine the housing market evaluate available housing alternatives formulate future housing plans secure any necessary financing and decide whether to purchase the condominium unit or relocate  and whereas this emergency cannot be dealt with solely by the operation of the private rental housing market and unless evictions for condominium conversions and cooperatives are regulated and controlled such emergency and the inflationary pressures and displacement resulting therefrom will produce serious threats to the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of new bedford  now therefore pursuant to the authority vested in it by law including without limitation of the acts of 198 as amended by of the acts of 198 be it ordained by the city council of the
