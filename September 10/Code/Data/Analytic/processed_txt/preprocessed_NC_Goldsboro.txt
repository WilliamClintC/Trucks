been received within 24 hours c1bypass is prohibited and the potw director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless abypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  bthere were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and cthe user submitted notices as required under subsection b of this section 2the potw director may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the potw director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection c1 of this section passed 112194 enforcement response plan   introduction afederal and state pretreatment regulations as well as b6 of the city of goldsboros npdes permit requires the city to take timely and effective enforcement actions against significant industrial users sius for failure to comply with pretreatment standards and requirements federal and state regulations also require each potw with an approved pretreatment program to develop and implement an enforcement response plan erp by regulation this plan must 1describe how the potw will investigate instances of noncompliance  2describe the types of escalating enforcement responses the potw will take in response to all anticipated types of siu violations and the time periods within which responses will take place  3identify the officials responsible for each type of response  and 4adequately reflect the potws primary responsibility to enforce all applicable pretreatment requirements and standards bthe purpose of the city of goldsboros enforcement response plan is twofold first to ensure compliance with federal and state regulations second to ensure that if and when it is necessary for the city to enforce pretreatment standards and requirements all industries are treated in a fair and equitable manner passed 112194   enforcement authorities available to the city agives the public utilities director the authority to take a wide variety of enforcement actions each of these actions can be viewed as having a certain degree of punitiveness the citys enforcement response plan will utilize all of the enforcement tools available to the director in the system which outlines escalating enforcement actions dependent on the nature of the violation and the cooperativeness or recalcitrance of the violator the following is a list of remedies authorized by the sewer use ordinance and ordinance citation it is presented in order of punitiveness least punitive first and most punitive last 1notice of violation  a 2consent order  b 3administrative order  c 4show cause orderhearing  d 5emergency suspensions temporary  e 6termination of permit permanent  f 7civil penalties  a and b 8judicial remedies  a and b bin addition to the tools listed above   the director to assess civil penalties of up to $100000 per day per violation civil penalties are normally used in conjunction with one of the other eight activities listed above and the punitiveness of the penalty depends on the dollar amount passed 112194   noncompliance determinations the staff will generally investigate siu compliance three ways on site inspections of the siu review of siu selfmonitoring data and review of compliance data collected by the city using the this chapter as well as guidance which has been provided by epa and the division of environmental management the city staff has identified four categories of permit noncompliance below is a discussion of the types of violations within each category and the city staff member responsibility for the initial compliance determination for each violation type aunpermitted discharges 1unpermitted discharges can result from several activities an siu might fail to obtain a permit prior to discharging to the wastewater treatment plant an siu might discharge to a point in the collection system which is not identified in the sius permit an siu might begin to discharge a pollutant which was previously identified as absent by the industry also an siu might continue to discharge when its permit has expired 2unpermitted discharges will normally be discovered during the inspection of an industry the inspector will be responsible for determining the severity of the violation during his inspection the severity will normally depend on whether the unpermitted discharge poses an immediate threat to the potw or the environment and whether the industry was unaware of the requirements or was seeking to avoid the regulations bpermit noncompliance noncompliance with an sius pretreatment permit falls into four areas limits violations monitoring violations reporting violations and violations of permit conditions 1permit limit noncompliance permit limit violations are fairly straight forward and the severity depends on whether the violation is considered reportable noncompliance rnc rnc is defined in north carolinas general pretreatment regulations 15a ncac 2h0903b10 it is the pretreatment coordinators responsibility to evaluate compliance with pretreatment limitations each time data is received and at the end of each semiannual reporting period 2selfmonitoring noncompliance anoncompliance with monitoring occurs when an siu fails to conduct all of the selfmonitoring required by its pretreatment permit the severity of the violations depends on how much selfmonitoring was actually completed if the siu conducted less than 80% of the sampling and analyses required in a sixmonth period the violation is considered significant or rnc beach time a selfmonitoring report is received from an siu it is the responsibility of the pretreatment coordinator to compare the report to the permit requirement sand evaluate compliance with monitoring requirements 3reporting violations areporting violations occur when an siu fails to provide information which is required by the permit within the time period stated in the permit or when the information is incomplete or false reports required by the permit can include self monitoring reports spill prevention plans baseline monitoring reports 90day compliance reports and sludge handling plans in the case of late or incomplete reports the severity of the violation depends on the length of time the report is late if a complete report is not submitted within 30 days of the due date the violation is considered rnc knowingly submitting false information is always considered a significant violation bit is the pretreatment coordinators responsibility to track the report due dates included in the pretreatment permits and to evaluate compliance in terms of the tardiness and completeness of the submission 4violations of other permit conditions the pretreatment permits issued by the city contain about 20 conditions which do not fall into the category of limits monitoring or reporting requirements for example the pretreatment permit prohibits slug loads and requires the siu to properly operate its pretreatment facility violations of these conditions would normally be discovered as part of an inspection or in conjunction with another enforcement action the pretreatment coordinator is responsible for evaluating compliance with these requirements and the severity of the violation is determined by the director cviolations of enforcement orders 1violations of enforcement orders are actually very similar to pretreatment permit noncompliance in that they can be broken down into limits violations interim limits monitoring violations increased monitoring required by the order and reporting violations in addition violations of enforcement orders would include missing milestone dates and noncompliance with final limits once the order has expired however all violations of enforcement orders with the exception of interim limits violations are considered rnc interim limit violations would not be considered significant if they did not meet the criteria listed in 15a ncac 2h0903b10a and if the siu paid the stipulated penalty assessed 2once an siu has been put on an enforcement order the citys initial response to violations becomes simply a matter of notifying the siu of the violation and collecting the stipulated penalty outlined in the order it is the pretreatment coordinators responsibility to track compliance with the order and notify the director when penalties should be assessed once the director is informed of noncompliance with an order he will determine whether the violations are so severe as to warrant escalated enforcement for example an escalated enforcement actions would be needed if it was clear that the siu could no longer meet the remaining milestone dates in the existing order passed 112194   responses to noncompliance ain order to ensure that the city is taking timely and effective enforcement actions two tools will be employed  an enforcement response guide in subsection c and an enforcement flowchart the purpose of the enforcement response guide erg is to identify initial responses and time frames for each of the types of violations discussed in   once the enforcement action is taken the flow chart is used to identify the more punitive action which would be taken if the siu failed to return to compliance as a result of the previous or initial action bas an example of how the erg and flowchart can be used to determine appropriate enforcement responses consider an siu which submits a selfmonitoring report which shows a violation the erg tells the pretreatment coordinator to issue a notice of noncompliance within 14 days the notice will require the siu to collect additional data to confirm compliance or noncompliance the next step is to determine if the siu is in reportable noncompliance rnc at the end of the six month reporting period as indicated by the flow chart if the data does not show rnc no action is required if the data does show rnc a notice of violation nov is issued the erg tells the pretreatment coordinator that in response to rnc with permit limits an nov assessing a fine of $100 should be sent within 30 days of receiving all of the data the nov requires the siu to respond by indicating the cause and time needed to correct the violation if the time needed to correct the violation was greater than 90 days a consent order would be drafted hopefully the siu would comply with the consent order and the violation would be resolved however if the siu failed to meet the compliance date of the consent order the flow chart indicates that a notice to comply should be issued and the erg gives the pretreatment coordinator information on time frames penalties and responses which should be included in the notice to comply by using the flowchart and erg a worst case scenario can be followed in a similar manner issuance and violation of an administrative order show cause meeting and eventually to termination of service caction chart chart begins on the following page  enforcement response plan

shall assess the costs of such extension except for costs incurred for the oversizing of lines due to projected expansions to the abutting property owners located within the city 3the requesting developer shall then be entitled to access to the water and sewer lines and may gain such access on the property described in a voluntary annexation petition the developer shall be required to pay all costs incurred with the extension of the line from the city limits to the points of disbursement on his property if the property of the developer is not contiguous to the city limits he shall likewise be responsible for extending the line to the nearest point of access on his property outside the city limits the developer shall not be responsible for the payment of the costs of an oversized line 4it shall be the responsibility of the developer to extend all lines within his subdivision tract or property to ensure water and sewer service to all existing or potential development within the property described in the petition for voluntary annexation 5although the city shall be dedicated to the concept of making such extensions possible the city shall not be responsible for such extensions if funds are not reasonably available in the event that there are not reasonable funds available for the extensions of such lines the city shall be entitled to consider and implement one or more of the following options athe city may deny the petition for annexation bthe city may negotiate with the developer and reach an agreement whereby the developer will pay the citys cost which would normally be incurred under this chapter and may be reimbursed at a later date as funds become available to the city cthe city may reach an agreement with the developer to accept the petition for annexation without the extension of any water and sewer lines dthe city may reach a contractual agreement with the developer whereby the acceptance of the petition for voluntary annexation will be delayed until some future date upon the citys extension of the lines 6a developer who participates in the costs of the extension of lines will be entitled to recapture his costs fees frontage fees will be established by the city based upon the actual cost of the construction per front foot the recapture of costs of construction shall not include however any federal or state funds which may be available to the developer in the extension of these lines the developer shall not be entitled to recover a frontage fee based upon his own front footage nor shall he be entitled to recover frontage fees in excess of his actual cost 7athe frontage fee charged by the city shall be based upon the then current cost of construction rather than the original cost of construction the city shall establish by resolution the frontage fee to be charged a developer property owner or lessee the cost incurred by virtue of the installation of oversized lines shall not be charged as a part of the frontage fee any monies collected in excess of the actual cost of construction and refunded to the developer or any funds received from frontage fees after 25 years shall be retained by the city in addition if the city is unable to locate the developer after reasonable inquiry any monies collected for frontage fees which would be refunded to the developer may be retained by the city after 30 days written notice to the developers last known address bfrontage fees shall be collected by the city for a period not to exceed 25 years these frontage fees shall be collected at the time that a tap is made provided however when the frontage fee exceeds $500 for residential use and $1000 for nonresidential use then and in that event the frontage fees may be paid in five annual equal installments and shall bear interest at the same rate as that charged by the city for unpaid taxes from the date said tap is made the first installment shall be due and payable on the date a water or sewer account is opened with the city and the subsequent installment and interest payments shall be due and payable on the same day of the same month in each successive year until the indebtedness is paid in full

agreements a frontage fee based upon the current cost of construction as per city council resolution will be charged this entire fee will be retained by the city 9there may arise certain requests for water andor sanitary sewer line extensions which the developer cannot reasonably fund for example there are certain natural and manmade barriers existing in and around the city such as swamps creeks rivers railroads highways and the like where the costs of extension of lines across such barriers would be extremely high it is the intent and concept of this chapter that the city should consider the possibilities of future expansions and resulting benefits in determining whether or not to participate or accept a petition for voluntary annexation from a developer whose line would be extended across such barriers the city may negotiate solutions to line extension problems which arise by virtue of these barriers bfor industrial property 1an industry will be defined as listed under division

costs in accordance with this chapter and formula provided for the payment of frontage fees for residential and commercial development if the developer is in fact the county the developer will be responsible for the extension of water and sewer lines including any oversized lines to be required for future development in addition the operation and maintenance of pump lift stations constructed relative to these lines outside of the city limits would be borne by the county until properly for which pump lift station was installed is annexed if the developer is in fact a private developer then it shall be the responsibility of the city to bear the costs of any oversized lines required by it however the county will also be entitled to the recoupment of its expenses including oversized lines fees in accordance with the policy and formula described for residential and commercial development recapture of the expenses of oversized lines shall be based upon the front foot cost of the line excluding oversizing plus the lines future inflated cost not to exceed the original front foot cost of the oversized line 5any industry located outside the city limits obtaining access to water andor

factual reasons on which they are based 1 there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the order to determine that there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships the board must find that the five following conditions exist a if the applicant complies with the provisions of the the applicant can secure no reasonable return from nor make reasonable use of his property merely proving that the variance would permit a greater profit to be made from the property will not be considered adequate to justify the board in granting a variance moreover the board shall consider whether the variance is the minimum possible deviation from the terms of the will make possible the reasonable use of the applicants property b the hardship results from the application of the the property rather than from other factors such as deed restrictions or other hardship c the hardship is due to the physical nature of the applicants property such as its size shape or topography which is different from that of neighboring property d the hardship is not the result of the actions of an applicant who knowingly or unknowingly violates the or who purchases the property after the effective date of the then comes to the board for relief e the hardship is peculiar to the applicants property rather than the result of conditions that are widespread if other properties are equally subject to the hardship created in the restriction then granting a variance would be a special privilege denied to others and would not promote equal justice 591 updated  2 the variance is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the preserves its spirit 3 in the granting of the variance the public safety and welfare have been assured and substantial justice has been done the board shall not grant a variance if it finds that doing so would in any respect impair the public health safety or general welfare c in granting the variance the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location character and other features of the proposed building structure or use as it may deem advisable in furtherance of the purpose of this ordinance if a variance for the construction alteration or use of property is granted such construction alteration or use shall be in accordance with the approved site plan d the watershed review board shall refuse to hear an appeal or an application for a variance previously denied if it finds that there have been no substantial changes in conditions or circumstances bearing on the appeal or application e a variance issued in accordance with this be considered a watershed protection permit and shall expire if a building permit or watershed occupancy permit for such use is not obtained by the applicant within six 6 months from the date of the decision f if the application calls for the granting of a major variance and if the watershed review board decides in favor of granting the variance the board shall prepare a preliminary record of the hearing with all deliberate speed the preliminary record of the hearing shall include 1 the variance application  2 the hearing notices  3 the evidence presented  4 motions offers of proof objections to evidence and rulings on them  5 proposed findings and exceptions  6 the proposed decision including all conditions proposed to be added to the permit the preliminary record shall be sent to the environmental management commission for its review as follows 1 if the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that 1 the property owner can secure no reasonable return from nor make any practical use of the property unless the proposed variance is granted and 2 the variance if granted will not result in a serious threat to the water supply then the commission shall approve the variance as proposed or approve the proposed variance with conditions and stipulations the commission shall prepare a commission decision and send it to the watershed review board if the commission approves the variance as proposed the board shall prepare a final decision granting the proposed variance if the commission approves the variance 592 updated  with conditions and stipulations the board shall prepare a final decision including such conditions and stipulations granting the proposed variance 2 if the commission concludes from the preliminary record that the variance qualifies as a major variance and that 1 the property owner can secure a reasonable return from or make a practical use of the property without the variance or 2 the variance if granted will result in a serious threat to the water supply then the commission shall deny approval of the variance as proposed

least 25 5105 updated  decibels db in dnl 6569 and 30 db in dnl 7074 must be incorporated c normal permanent construction can be expected to provide an nlr of 20 db thus the reduction requirements are often stated as 5 10 or 15 db over standard construction and normally assume mechanical ventilation upgraded sound transmission class ratings in windows and doors and closed windows year round additional consideration will be given to modifying nlr levels based on peak noise levels or vibrations d nlr criteria will not eliminate outdoor noise problems however building location site planning design and use of berms and barriers can help mitigate outdoor noise exposure particularly from ground level sources measures that reduce noise at a site should be used wherever practical in preference to measures that only protect interior spaces 2 measures to achieve a nlr of 25 must be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where the public is

calculated this export will be calculated in pounds per acre per year lbacyr the following methodologies will be used for calculating nitrogen export from new development refer to the city of goldsboro stormwater management program for nitrogen control in the neuse river basin for calculating nitrogen export loading 1 method 1 is intended for residential developments where lots are shown but the actual footprints of buildings are not shown on the plans 2 method 2 is for residential commercial and industrial developments when the entire footprint of the roads parking lots buildings and any other builtupon area is shown on the site plans 3 for nonresidential subdivisions where the impervious surfaces are not shown on the plans at the time of submittal the developer or builder will specify areas of impervious surface undisturbed open space and managed open space in their building permit application assuming the maximum impervious surfaces and minimum open space for the project

state are not waters of the state  findings of fact 1 water quality has been an issue in the neuse river basin for over a century despite a number of initiatives between 1950 and 199 the neuse river basin has continued to have water quality problems although environmental conditions in the neuse river are driven by complex interactions between rainfall flows temperatures biological factors and chemistry the long history of problems with nutrient pollution and algal blooms provides evidence that immediate control measures are necessary 2 in august 199 the final comprehensive neuse river nutrient sensitive waters strategy was adopted the goal of the strategy is to achieve a 30 percent nitrogen reduction from each controllable and quantifiable source of nitrogen in the basin the city was one of the 15 largest and fastestgrowing local governments in the neuse river basin which was required to comply with the neuse stormwater rule this rule contains four program elements one of which pertains to illegal discharges 3 illegal discharges are substances deposited in storm sewers which lead directly to streams that really should be handled as wastewater discharges depending on the source illegal discharges may contain nitrogen local governments that must comply with the neuse stormwater rule including the city must identify and remove illegal discharges  statement of purpose 1 the purpose of this to  protect the public health safety and welfare by controlling the discharge of pollutants into the stormwater conveyance system   promote activities directed toward the

trees and prolongs their useful life be removing undesirable branches which are dead weakened diseased or insectinfested types of pruning  the national arborist association recognizes four classes of pruning which define the type and degree of recommended pruning class1 fine pruning  the thorough removal of undesirable branches over  in diameter this includes selective thinning to lessen wind resistance see drawing class 2 standard pruning  the removal of undesirable branches over 1 in diameter class 3 hazard pruning  the removal of undesirable branches over 2 in diameter this class is recommended where safety considerations are paramount class 4 crown reduction pruning  the reduction in the size of the tree canopy topping vs thinning  proper pruning is not to be confused with the disfiguring practice of topping which is prohibited topping is the indiscriminate removal of a trees main leader and branches resulting in stubs the cut surfaces of the stubs do not close readily and internal decay develops the resulting flush of multiple water sprouts from the stubbed branches form terminals that are very weak topping leaves a tree highly susceptible to damage from strong winds winter injury insects and diseases thinning is the correct method for removal of branches to their point of attachment to the trunk or another branch this method eliminates unhealthy and unsightly stubs resulting in an open airy natural appearance to trees thinning requires more skill and time to perform than does topping trees that are properly pruned and thinned will live longer and should not need to be pruned as often as trees that have been topped when to prune  maintenance pruning of most shade trees can be done anytime severe pruning however should be done in late winter or early spring before new growth begins pruning of bleeder that is trees like birch and maple which seep profusely from cut surfaces in the spring  is sometimes delayed until the fall although the loss of sap is seldom injurious unless the cuts are large pruning of trees susceptible to certain vascular diseases like american elm and red oak should be avoided during the activity period of beetles which spread the diseases how to prune trees  the objective of pruning is to produce strong healthy attractive plants by understanding how when and why to prune and by following a few simple principles this objective can be achieved pruning cuts should be made so that only branch tissue is removed and stem tissue is not damaged at the point where the branch attaches to the stem branch and stem tissues remain separate but are contiguous if only branch tissues are cut when pruning the stem tissue of the tree will probably not become decayed and the wound will seal more effectively 5 pruning living branches  to find the proper place to cut a branch look for the branch collar that grows from the stem tissue at the underside of the base of the branch on the upper surface there is usually a branch bark ridge that runs more or less parallel to the branch angle along the stem of the tree a proper pruning cut does not damage either the branch bark ridge or the branch collar a proper cut begins just outside the branch bark ridge and angles down away from the stem of the tree avoiding injury to the branch collar make the cut as close as possible to the stem in the branch axil but outside the branch bark ridge so that stem tissue is not injured and the wound can seal in the shortest time possible if the cut is too far from the stem leaving a branch stub the branch tissue usually dies and woundwood forms from the stem tissue the quality of prune cuts can be evaluated by examining pruning wounds after one growing season a concentric ring of woundwood will form from proper pruning cuts when pruning small branches with hand pruners make sure the tools are sharp enough to cut the branches cleanly without tearing branches large enough to require saws should be supported with one hand while the cuts are made if the branch is too large to support make a threestep pruning cut to prevent bark ripping 1 the first cut is a shallow notch made on the underside of the branch outside the branch collar this cut will prevent a falling branch from tearing the stem tissue as it pulls away from the tree 2 the second cut should be outside the first cut all the way branch leaving a short stub 3 the stub is then cut just outside the branch bark ridgebranch collar completing the operation pruning dead branches  prune dead branches in much the same way as live branches making the correct cut is usually easy because the branch collar and the branch bark ridge can be distinguished from the dead branch drop crotch cuts  a proper cut begins just above the branch bark ridge and extends stem parallel to the branch bark ridge usually the stem being removed is too large to be supported with one hand so the three cut method should be used 6 1 with the first cut make a notch on the side of the stem away from the branch to be retained well above the branch crotch 2 begin the second cut inside the branch crotch staying well above the branch bark ridge and cut stem above the notch 3 cut the remaining stub just inside the branch bark ridge stem parallel to the branch bark ridge to prevent the abundant growth of sprouts on the stem below the cut make the cut at a lateral branch that is at least onethird of the diameter of the stem of their union guidelines  crown thinning  assess how a tree will be pruned from the top down  favor branches with strong ushaped angles of attachment remove branches with weak vshaped angles of attachment  ideally lateral branches should be evenly spaced on the main stem of young trees  remove any branches that rub or cross another branch  make sure that lateral branches are no more than onehalf to threequarters of the diameter of the stem to discourage the development of codominant stems  do not remove more than onequarter of the living crown of a tree at one time if it is necessary to remove more do it over successive years crown raising  always maintain live branches on at least twothirds of a trees total height removing too many lower branches will hinder the development of a strong stem  remove basal sprouts crown reduction  use crown reduction pruning only when absolutely necessary make the pruning cut at a lateral branch that is at least onethird the diameter of the stem to be removed  if it is necessary to remove more than half of the foliage from a branch remove the entire branch 7 8 4 planting guidelines the following guidelines to tree planting will help reduce transplanting shock and ensure that trees adapt to the new site keep in mind that spring and fall are the best times of the year to plant trees planting the tree  the tree should be planted at the same depth or slightly higher than it was growing at the nursery a high mound should be avoided as the soils can dry out quickly in the summer and freeze in the winter the hole should be dug shallow and wide it should not be any deeper than the root ball but should be a wide hole allowing for amendments if necessary or for loosening heavy soil to allow for improved oxygen availability and root penetration the backfill soil should be added gradually and watered carefully to settle the soil but not to saturate it balled and burlapped trees should have any untreated burlap pulled away from the top of the root ball and cut away not buried so that none of the burlap is exposed at the soil surface otherwise the burlap can wick moisture away from the roots of the freshly planted tree staking the tree  stakes should only be necessary to support trees on windy sites or for smaller trees with weak trunks the stakes should be placed before the backfill is added to avoid damaging any large roots a stake is meant to provide temporary support and should be removed within a year or two to allow the tree to develop trunk strength and to limit the potential for physical damage from the stakes and support ties anything used for a tie should have a flat smooth surface and be somewhat elastic to allow for slight movement for the tree suitable materials include rubber strips or webbing and belting wire covered with a hose or tubing should not be used water  because a newly transplanted tree may have lost much of its root system watering is critical for successful establishment initial watering at planting should be followed with weekly watering at a minimum particularly during dry periods a newly planted tree will benefit from at least an inch of water a week mulch  newly planted trees respond well to mulch placed around the tree this reduces initial root competition with turf and limits the possibility of physical damage by mowers mulch material also allows for the exchange of gases between the atmosphere and soil  helps provide for better water penetration into soil  and reduces evaporation of soil water conserving soil moisture for optimal root growth these factors contribute to the health of the trees and increase the likelihood of survival the mulch should not be piled around the tree and should not actually touch the tree trunk no more than a 23 inch depth of mulch should be added with it being no more than  inch deep closest to the tree effects of too much mulch in planting areas include excessive moisture reduced oxygen and fungal growth the ideal mulch pattern tapers from a two  four inch depth of wellcomposted organic matter at the dripline of trees and shrubs to bare soil at the trunk sandy soils need deeper mulch layers over the new rootzone than clay soils pruning  when planting a tree only dead or broken branches should be removed all living branches should be left on the tree to help promote tree establishment once the tree has been established on the site training pruning can be done to promote good branching patterns but no more than  of the branches should be removed at any one time fertilizer  9 fertilizer is not generally necessary at the time of planting and indeed if placed improperly in the planting hole can injure roots however the addition of nitrogen if applied as recommended on the product label can benefit a newly planted tree 10 iii stormwater control facilities 11 general a within a water supply protection district the total allowable
