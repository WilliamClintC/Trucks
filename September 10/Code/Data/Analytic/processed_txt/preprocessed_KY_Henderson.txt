codes each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter thus the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 11 and the third section of chapter 6 is 63 under this system each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments by way of illustration if new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 63 and 64 is desired to be added such new sections would be numbered 631 632 and 633 respectively new chapters may be included in the same manner if the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as chapter 125 care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters

cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986  young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976  fwpbs inc v city of dallas 493 us 215 1990  barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991  city of erie v paps am 120 s ct 1382 2000  and on studies in other communities including but not limited to dallas texas  town and village of ellicottville new york  tucson arizona  st marys georgia  st croix county wisconsin  newport news virginia  and garden grove california  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the board of commissioners finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 8 the sale use distribution or consumption of alcoholic beverages in sexually oriented businesses tends to foster criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions among such acts of criminal behavior include disorderly conduct prostitution and drug trafficking and use 9 the findings noted in subsections 1 8 raise substantial governmental concerns 10 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 11 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 12 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 13 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 14 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 15 in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 16 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 17 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 18 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the

of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or cause damage to the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city of henderson to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance should be rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b the board of zoning adjustment as established by the city of henderson shall hear and decide requests for variance from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter for purposes of this section the board of zoning adjustment shall be referred to as the appeals board c the appeals board shall not hear any request for a variance from the requirements of this chapter unless the applicant has first made application to the kentucky division of water and received written approval from same for any construction for which a variance is being requested however approval from the kentucky division of water shall not guarantee approval of a request for variance from the appeals board d any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeals board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the henderson circuit court as provided in the kentucky revised statutes e variances may be issued for the reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section except for subsections 1316h1 and 4 provided the proposed reconstruction rehabilitation or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation f in passing upon such application the appeals board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  5 the necessity of the facility to a waterfront location in the case of a functionally dependent facility  6 the availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and the floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges f upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter the appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter g variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result h conditions for variances 1 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the appeals board need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the appeals board believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 2 in the instance of a historic structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure  3 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship  and c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined above or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 4 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation  5 the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variance to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request 6 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections 1316ak are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance i variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county court clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land by means of a land use restriction 3 the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to fema j historic structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure exh a 1813 article v  provisions for flood hazard reduction general construction standards in all areas
