entertainment establishment seminole county florida matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to this chapter and other matters and documents relating to all of the above  the city council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses further there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this chapter engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate areas booths or cubicles for viewing films videos live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers 4 offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 1985 and 253448  and the number of people in the united states living with an aids diagnosis as of february 2012 is 479161 8 as of  there have been 51838 reported cases of aids in the state 9 from 1981 to june 199 the number of living persons testing positive for the hiv antibody with aids symptoms has risen to 73217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported in 2011 was 321849 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in subsections b1 15 of this section and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order health safety and welfare of its patrons and workers as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business and adult entertainment establishments where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 24 commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central florida where adult entertainment material is possessed displayed exhibited distributed andor sold for commercial purposes in the form of books magazines periodicals or other printed material or photographs films motion pictures prints videotapes slides computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings or recordings or other audio matter or instruments novelties devices or paraphernalia which depict illustrate describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas 25 commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in the state where adult entertainment and sexually oriented commercial activities in the form of nude seminude or topless dancers entertainers performers or other individuals who for commercial gain perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers 26 commercial sexually oriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in the state where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact escort services and other services providing sexual encounters the workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in the state engage in physical contact or touching with customers including but not limited to acts of prostitution or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness 27 the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and as such are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order health safety economy property values morals and general welfare of the people businesses and industries of the city a major industry which is important to the communitys economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit the city who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes 28 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses other activities which are illegal unsafe or unhealthful tend to accompany them concentrate around them and be aggravated by them such other activities include but are not limited to prostitution pandering solicitation for prostitution lewd and lascivious behavior exposing minors to harmful materials possession distribution and transportation of obscene materials sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property 29 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients blight neighborhoods adversely affect neighboring businesses lower real property values promote the particular crimes described above and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations 30 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline 31 the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity unsafe activity and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life commerce and community environment 32 physical contact or touching within sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases 33 in order to preserve and safeguard the good order health morals safety and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners managers operators agents workers entertainers performers and customers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments 34 the potential dangers to the good order morals health safety and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate 35 requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments 36 prohibiting sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments from operating within set distances of educational institutions religious institutions residences areas zoned or designated for residential use and parks at which minors are customarily found will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses 37 straddle dancing unregulated private performances and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression 38 workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses including but not limited to a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of fs ch 796 operation without business tax receipts and illegal and unlicensed massage 39 physical contact or touching between workers of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmissible diseases 40 the practice of not paying or underpaying workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers 41 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments involve some activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health good order morals welfare and safety of the community 42 requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist in facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur 43 the general welfare health good order morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter c intent it is the intent of this chapter to protect and preserve the good order health peace morals safety and welfare of the citizens of the city this

compatible contemporary designs that are harmonious with the exterior architectural and landscape features of neighboring buildings and streetscapes the salient points of these standards are as follows a a property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment b the historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved the removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided c each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time place and use changes that create a false sense of historical development such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other

historic places shall be regulated by the historic preservation board l visual compatibility within historic districts improvements to buildings structures and appurtenances within a designated historic district shall be visually compatible visual compatibility is defined in terms of the following criteria 1 height the height of proposed buildings or modifications shall be visually compatible in comparison or relation to the height of existing structures and buildings the goal of this consideration is to seek a visual harmony so that no one element stands out in contrast to the collective character of the whole 2 primary facade proportion the front facade of each building or structure or in the case of corner or isolated buildings multiple facades shall be visually compatible with and in direct relationship to the width of the building and to the height of the primary elevation of other adjacent or adjoining buildings within a historic district visual compatibility is measured by the absence of elements that stand out as intrusions to the general character of the streetscape 3 proportion of openings windows and doors the openings of any building within a historic district shall be visually compatible with the openings exemplified by the prevailing historic architectural styles within the district the relationship of the width of windows and doors to the height of windows and doors among buildings within the district will be visually compatible frequently a geometry is created along a streetscape by the dimensions of the openings within a buildings mass the objective of this design consideration is to maintain that geometry 4 rhythm of solids to voids of front facades the relationship of solids to voids in the front facade of a building or structure shall be visually compatible with the front facades of historic buildings or structures within the district 5 rhythm of buildings on streets the relationship of buildings to open space between it or them and adjoining buildings shall be visually compatible with the relationship between historic sites buildings and structures within a historic district this consideration

a building shall be visually compatible with the prevalent architectural styles of entrances and porch projections on historic sites buildings and structures within a historic district this consideration again references the operation of geometry in its establishment of visual continuity along a streetscape 7 relationship to materials and texture the relationship of materials and texture of the facade of a building shall be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in the historic sites buildings and structures within a historic district in other words a district that is predominantly composed of wood frame houses would not benefit from the introduction of a masonry material 8 roof shapes the roof shape of a building or structure shall be visually compatible with the roof shape of a historic site building or structure within a historic district 9 walls of continuity appearances of a building or structure such as walls wrought iron fences evergreen landscape masses or building facades shall form cohesive walls of enclosure along a street to ensure visual compatibility of the building to historic buildings structures or sites to which it is visually related the objective here is to maintain the perimeter of the historic district by maintaining a relationship between the height and material used to frame a property boundary 10 scale of building the size of a building the building mass in relation to open spaces windows door openings balconies and porches shall be visually compatible with the building size and building mass of historic sites buildings and structures within a historic district 11 directional expression of primary elevation a building shall be visually compatible with the buildings structures and sites in its directional character

promulgate rules and regulations for governing its parks and recreation department including but not limited to rules and regulations governing the use of cityowned or controlled public parks and public facilities  2 the city has decided for the betterment of the public health safety and welfare to amend this chapter to revise and amplify the rules governing the use of cityowned or controlled parks and facilities and to change the name of the department to the parks and recreation department  3 the city encourages use of cityowned or controlled parks by city residents in a safe sanitary and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere  4 unregulated large group feeding in public parks owned or controlled by the city has resulted in litter on park grounds and surrounding rightsofway such as food food containers and other food wrappings creating hazards to the health safety and welfare of citizens birds and animals and is detrimental to the aesthetic atmosphere of parks  5 large group feedings in public parks owned or controlled by the city require provision of adequate trash receptors and additional park personnel for inspection and cleanup of park grounds which would be more manageable by advance notice and regulation of large group feedings permit system  6 the city is experiencing a steady and significant increase in residential and other growth and a corresponding competition for park space and usage by citizens  7 excessive use of parks and park facilities in cityowned or controlled parks for large group feedings by single persons or groups denies that park or facility space for use by other citizens which placement of reasonable time place and manner restrictions on use for large group feedings would resolve  8 testimony before city council has demonstrated that fear intimidation and criminal acts have accompanied or followed some large group feedings in some parks owned or controlled by the city which has affected the health safety and welfare of city residents  9 the city is committed to and has provided for and set aside reasonable ample alternative land space within parks owned or controlled by the city for large group feedings by religious and other organizations  10 the current parks and park facilities owned or controlled by the city and future parks owned or controlled by the city are particularly affected by all the foregoing conditions and confining large group feedings to only a few parks owned or controlled by the city without adequate time place and manner regulations as provided for by this ordinance would continue to adversely

general secs 5015013  reserved article ii  stormwater utility findings and purpose a the city council finds that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city further the city council finds more specifically as follows 1 stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into receiving bodies thereby degrading water quality 2 the increase in nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving water bodies thereby adversely affecting flora and fauna 3 improperly channeling water increases the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation 4 construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion 5 siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases the capacity of said water bodies to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna 6 impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge 7 improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidents of flooding and the level of floods which occur thereby endangering property and human life 8 improperly managed stormwater runoff may interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas thereby disrupting biological productivity 9 substantial economic losses may result from such adverse impacts upon the waters of the city ecosystem 10 sound stormwater utility management practices result in the avoidance of future problems concerning the development of land and the maintenance of the quality of the city environment b the purpose of this article is to protect maintain and enhance both the immediate and the longterm health safety and general welfare of the citizens residents and inhabitants of melbourne florida in order to effectuate

throughout the city  5 to encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between humanity and nature  6 to protect restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of community waters  7 to prevent individuals business organizations and governments from causing harm to the community by activities which adversely affect water resources  8 to encourage the construction of drainage systems which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems  9 to encourage the protection of natural systems and the use of such natural systems in ways which do not impair their beneficial functioning  10 to encourage the use of drainage systems which minimize the consumption of electrical energy or petroleum fuels in order to move water remove pollutants and maintain said systems  11 to minimize the transport of pollutants to community waters  12 to maintain or restore groundwater levels  13 to protect maintain or to restore natural salinity levels in estuarine areas  14 to minimize erosion and sedimentation  15 to prevent damage to wetlands  16 to reduce damage from flooding while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial  17 to protect restore and maintain the habitat of fish and wildlife  18 to ensure the attainment of these objectives by requiring the approval and implementation of a stormwater management program for all

stormwater management plan short title this article shall be known and may be cited as the city of melbourne stormwater management  231   findings of fact the city council finds that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the health safety and welfare of the community more specifically 1 stormwater runoff can carry pollutants into receiving water bodies degrading water quality 2 the increase in nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters adversely affecting flora and fauna 3 improperly channeling water increases the velocity of runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation 4 construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion 5 siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna 6 impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge 7 improperly managed stormwater runoff can increase the incidence of flooding and the level of floods which occur endangering property and human life 8 improperly managed stormwater runoff can interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas thereby disrupting the biological productivity 9 substantial economic losses result from these adverse impacts on community waters 10 many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff management practices 232   objectives in order to protect maintain and enhance both the immediate and the long term health safety and general welfare of the

standards a pretreatment standards specifying quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which have the potential to be discharged in accordance with 40 cfr 4036 as of  to a wwf by existing or new industrial users in specific industrial subcategories are established as separate federal regulations under the appropriate subpart of 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405 which have been incorporated by reference in fac 62 these standards are hereby adopted and incorporated herein these pretreatment standards unless specifically noted otherwise shall be in addition to all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements set forth in sections 58279 b where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the coordinator may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with subsection e of this section c when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the coordinator may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users d when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the coordinator shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with fac 626 e when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the coordinator the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsection e1 of this section 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 1 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must i maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  ii continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  iii continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the coordinator whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in subsection e1c of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the coordinator will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and iv continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection e1a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 2 when developing equivalent mass limits the coordinator i will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  ii upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and iii may retain the same equivalent mass limits in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 58285 the industrial user must also be in compliance with section 58334 regarding the prohibition of bypass f the coordinator may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for the purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the coordinator g once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived h many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation i any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the coordinator within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the coordinator of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the longterm average production rate    10121999   12132011 pretreatment standards  local

michael a mcnees city manager ____________ alison dawley city attorney ____________ cathleen a wysor city clerk preface this volume ii contains the land development regulations of the city and the franchises and constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the city of melbourne florida source materials used in the preparation of the the 1984 as supplemented  and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof the absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume the reader can locate any section of the 1984 as supplemented and any subsequent ordinance included herein the appendices comprising the land development regulations have been conveniently arranged and designated and the various sections within each appendix have been catchlined to facilitate usage notes which tie related sections of the appendix together and which refer to relevant state law have been included a table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the appendix is included at the back of this volume system the section numbering system used in each appendix of the land development regulations is a numerical system beginning with section 1 and in the case of the land development code appendix d is a decimal system under this system each section is identified with its numerical position and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments for example if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 1 and 2 is desired to be added such new section would be numbered 15 new articles and new divisions may be included in the same way the next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division page numbering system the page numbering system used in this volume is a prefix system the letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume the number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion in the case of a page in the chapter of the appendix d the land development the number to the left of the colon indicates the appendix and the number of the chapter the following are typical parts of codes of ordinances which may or may not appear in this this time and their corresponding prefixes

300 feet within four nautical miles a height of 400 feet within five nautical miles of such airport or elsewhere at a height of 500 feet above the ground at the site of the proposed structure unless it can be shown 1 that notice of proposed construction or alteration has been given as required by of the federal aviation regulations 2 that the proposed structure will not raise the federal aviation administration established minimum descent altitude or decision height for an instrument approach to any runway or cause the minimum obstruction clearance altitude or minimum en route altitude to be increased on any federal airway 3 that the structure does not otherwise constitute an obstruction to air navigation use restrictions in addition to any land use restrictions contained in these regulations it shall be unlawful to make any use of land or water within any airport zone established by this regulation in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals

commitments to complete structures or deliver title thereto or occupancy thereof and the dates of and amounts of money involved in said commitment 8 whether prior to the date the comprehensive plan or land development regulation became pending the applicant incurred financial obligations to a lending institution which the applicant will be unable to meet and whether it would be inequitable and unjust to require the applicant to meet the new regulations and therefore should be permitted to proceed with the previously permitted type density or intensity of development 9 whether enforcement of the terms of the currently effective comprehensive plan or any land development regulation claimed to defeat the applicants right to develop a parcel of land will expose the applicant to substantial monetary liability to third persons or will leave the applicant completely unable after thorough review of alternative solutions to earn a reasonable return on his investment in the parcel of land 10 whether the applicant has a vested right to commence and complete only a portion of a proposed development on all or a portion of the applicants parcel of land 11 that the applicant owned an interest

proposed for the parcel of land was lawful and permitted at that time 12 whether the applicant has continuously owned the parcel of land since the date of the change in the comprehensive plan or land development regulation until the date of the public hearing before the city council on the special permit application 13 whether requiring that the applicants parcel of land be developed in accordance

included in the calculation of the applicants investment a expenditures for professional services that are unrelated to the design or construction of the improvements proposed for the type density or intensity of development claimed by the applicant to be vested b expenditures for taxes except for any increases in tax expenditures which result from issuance of development order which would now be contrary to the currently existing city comprehensive plan or relevant land development regulation c expenditures which the applicant has allocated to the particular proposed development but which the applicant would have been obligated to incur as an ordinary and necessary business expense for example employees salaries equipment rental chattel mortgage payments had the plan for the particular development not been formulated or a development order not been issued for the type density or intensity of development now claimed by the applicant to be vested 14 any other information relevant to discerning the applicants claim to vested rights to develop its parcel of land in a particular manner that may be pertinent under florida or federal law including the existence of an imminent peril to the public health safety welfare economic property general order aesthetics or appearance which should preclude approval of a vested rights special permit c vested rights the right of the applicant to

upon the applicants vested right to develop the subject parcel of land 2 by application of the considerations set out in subsection b hereof the applicant in good faith upon some act or omission of the city has made such a substantial change in position or has an investmentbacked expectation that would make it inequitable and unjust to destroy the right of the applicant to commence or complete a certain type density or intensity of development upon all or a portion of the applicants parcel of land 3 the fact that the parcel of land has been or is in a particular zoning or comprehensive planning land use district or classification under the currently effective or any prior city comprehensive plan or land development regulation shall not in and of itself establish that an applicants

option a purpose and intent the intent of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors to be known as the proportionate fairshare program as required by and in a manner consistent with fs  16 b findings 1 the melbourne city council finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and the city proportionate fairshare program a provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors  b allows developers to proceed under certain conditions notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency by contributing their proportionate fairshare of the cost of a transportation facility  c contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion  d maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth and may in certain circumstances allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements element cie  and e is consistent with fs  16 and supports the goals objectives and policies contained in the melbourne comprehensive plan as they relate to concurrency management and capital improvements planning and programming c applicability the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to all developments in the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the city concurrency management system cms including transportation facilities maintained by the florida department of transportation or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations pursuant to the requirements of subsection d the proportionate fairshare program does

fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the cie or longterm schedule of capital improvements for an adopted longterm cms no later than the next regularly scheduled update to qualify for consideration under this section the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city council and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to fs  16b1 consistent with the comprehensive plan and in compliance with the provisions of this ordinance financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities b if the funds allocated for the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the city cie are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the cms the city may still enter into a binding proportionate fairshare agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fairshare is calculated if the proportionate fairshare amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities significantly benefit the impacted transportation system the improvement or improvements funded by the

make a payment in lieu of providing the required mobility improvements this process is described in section  of this article b issuance and compliance of development order the citys mobility districts are identified on map iii9 of the transportation element within the melbourne comprehensive plan no development order will be issued for a proposed project within a mobility district that violates this standard all development order applications submitted subsequent to  must comply with the standards established in this section c exceptions building permits for developments approved before  will be required to provide any transportation improvements modifications mitigation or impact fees required as part of a previous development plan approval such projects will not be required to provide mobility standards as set forth in chapter 3 of this code building permits approved before  will also be required to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements as established in appendix

alternative modes of transportation by providing contextappropriate sidewalks bikeways transit facilities parking management or appropriate roadway improvements that will contribute to specific and identified mobility needs within the city these standards promote sustainable development patterns and livable neighborhoods while supporting the formation of complete streets all proposed mobility improvements will require prior city staff approval b requirements development and redevelopment projects issued a final development order after  within mobility districts must provide mobility improvements to enhance the functionality of the transportation system the number of required mobility improvements will be determined by the amount of new motor vehicle trips generated by the development or redevelopment project mobility improvements will be provided at the developers or property owners expense based on the developments trip generation and proportional impact on roadway facilities a traffic analysis impact study as defined in section 302 appendix d of city code must be prepared and submitted to the city at the developersproperty owners expense to determine the
