defined as solar collector means a device used to collect direct sunlight to heat or cool a structure heat domestic hot water or swimming pools or to generate electricity solar energy conversion system means equipment and wiring needed to collect store and convert solar energy into a useable form active solar systems rely upon mechanical means to collect light andor heat from the sun and convert it into useable energy passive systems use natural nonmechanical techniques to obtain energy from the sun including daylighting southfacing windows natural shading and ventilation and building materials to absorb heat from the sun and slowly photovoltaic cells means extremely thin solar energy collection cells usually made of silicon that collect solar energy and convert it to direct current dc electricity release it solar greenhouse means a solar collector that is a structure or part of a structure using glass or similar glazing material to collect direct sunlight for space heating purposes 9022 generally 1 all solar collectors shall comply with the adopted building code and shall require a building permit 2 all solar collectors shall comply with the renewable energy

installation may be permitted even if it exceeds the height limit established in the zoning district if the following conditions are met a there is no feasible alternative to placing the collectors on the roof  b the collectors are located so as to minimize view blockage for surrounding properties and shading of property to the north while still providing adequate solar access for the collectors  c
