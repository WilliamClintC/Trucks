wetlands are areas designated by the current us army corps of engineers delineation manual and any regional supplements or manual revisions and are areas inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support and under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions wetlands generally include swamps marshes bogs and similar areas and those transitional lands between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is at or near the surface or the lands are covered by shallow water wetland mitigation plans are required and shall be done in accordance with this code  3 credit for private open space and recreation areas when subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services depending on the sites of the development a portion of the park and recreation in subdivision or planned unit developments may at the option of the planning and zoning board and upon agreement of the park district be provided in the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space the extent of same shall be determined by the planning and zoning board based on the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land plan adopted by the park district for general use and approved by the village board   amd  in general a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities including equipment by developer as part of his obligation detailed plans of such areas including specifications of facilities to be installed must be submitted to the park district and before any credit is given for private recreation areas the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents private swimming clubs are included in the provision when an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted it will be necessary to complete the total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given however in no case shall private recreational facilities constitute more than seventy five percent 75% of the total requirement the park district shall either approve or disapprove said plans within thirty 30 days after submittal to it by the subdivider or developer approval by the park district is a condition precedent to allowance of credit for private open space c criteria for requiring contribution in lieu of park and school sites where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical or when available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site the village shall require the subdividerdeveloper to pay cash contribution in lieu of land dedication required this cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be collected by the village for the park district solely for the acquisition of park area recreation land as hereinbefore was classified which will be available to serve the immediate

lieu of school sites shall be collected by the village for the school district to be used solely for the acquisition by the school district of a school site to serve the immediate andor future needs of children from the proposed subdivision or pud or for the improvement including without limitation the construction of new buildings and building additions and improvements of any existing school

pursuant to this section for which such contribution was made  sterling codifiers inc  328498 1 fair market value the cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the improved land as determined by an mai appraisal of the total acreage included in the proposed development exclusive of wetlands as defined herein the present fair market value of such land shall be determined by the following four 4 factors a the average cost of one acre of unimproved unannexed land  b the cost per acre for specified improvements including but not limited to streets water and sanitary sewer service stormwater installation streetlights curbs and gutters  c the cost of mass grading of the subdivision  and d the average cost for extension of the sanitary sewer and water service in the event the park district or school district contest the valuation established in said mai appraisal said park district or school district shall have the option of obtaining their own mai appraisal the final determination of said fair market value per acre of such improved land shall be made by the corporate authorities of the village based upon the values established in the mai appraisal or appraisals for purposes of this section the term fair market value shall be deemed to mean no less than eighty three thousand dollars $8300000 per acre as such figure may be changed upward or downward from time to time by amendment to this chapter 2 criteria for requiring a dedication and fee there will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when a only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park or school site that portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated b a major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site the remaining portions shall be required by dedication and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required d density formula the table of population density set forth in subsection j of this section is generally indicative of current projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed hereto by the subdivider or developer in the event a subdivider files a written objection to the table of estimated ultimate population listed herein he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or

excessively large motor vehicles and certain motor vehicles that by virtue of their design type or characteristics are not customary and incidental to the use or occupancy of residential property has a detrimental and blighting impact upon the residential quality and character of such neighborhoods and that more than one such vehicle upon a lot compounds the blighting impact the village board finds that these vehicles intrude upon the aesthetics and visual peace and quiet of a residential neighborhood that they can impair the free flow of traffic on residential streets and by their size
