hazards  c disruption of commerce and governmental services  d extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection  and e impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by structures in flood hazard areas which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities 3 local government units have the primary responsibility for planning adopting and enforcing land use regulations to accomplish proper floodplain management c statement of purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life health and property  2 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water purification and sewage treatment plants water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  3 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas  4 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  5 minimize the need for rescue and emergency services associated with flooding generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  6 minimize prolonged business interruptions  7 ensure potential buyers are notified the property is in an area of special flood hazard  and 8 ensure those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions d objectives and methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purpose this chapter

protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands  5 preserve and restore natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which carry and store

increasing and excessive demands upon the public facilities c the revenues generated from new residential and nonresidential growth and development often does not generate sufficient funds to provide

public facilities and infrastructure e the city has planned for the improvement of the public facilities in the capital improvements element of the city of mountain home comprehensive plan f the creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the city to impose a proportionate share of the costs of needed improvements to the public facilities to accommodate new development and would assist the city in implementing the capital improvements element of the comprehensive plan g impact fees shall be assessed against new growth and development that increases the service area or places a demand on available service units requiring a capital expenditure by the city to maintain the current level of service to the existing or new service area h in order to implement an equitable impact fee system for the public facilities the city has prepared an impact fee study for these types of facilities which may be updated from time to time or at least every ten 10 years the impact fee study is on file in the office of the city clerk of the city of mountain home i the impact fee study is consistent with the capital improvements element of the city of mountain home comprehensive plan and uses the levels of service set forth in the comprehensive plan for these public facilities j the impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for determining the impacts of various types of new development on the public facilities and determines the cost of acquiring or constructing the improvements necessary to meet the demands for such public facilities created by new growth and development k the impact fee study uses a calculation methodology in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles this chapter shall not be deemed invalid because payment of an impact fee may result in an incidental benefit to others within the service area other than the fee payer the impact fee study uses a calculation methodology in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that is a net of credits for the present value of revenues that will be generated by new growth and development based on historical funding patterns and that are reasonably anticipated to be available to pay for system improvements including user fees debt service payments taxes assessments intergovernmental transfers and all other available sources of funding such system and includes consideration of the following factors 1 the cost of existing system improvements within the service area or areas  2 the means by which existing system improvements have been financed  3 the extent to which the new development will contribute to the cost of system improvements assessment or developer or landowner contributions or has previously contributed to the cost of system improvements or landowner contributions  4 the extent to which the new development is required to contribute to the cost of existing system improvements in the future  5 the extent to which the new development should be credited for providing system improvements without charge to other properties within the service area or areas   sterling codifiers inc  143258 6 extraordinary costs if any

revenue l the impact fees described in this chapter are based on the impact fee study and do not exceed the costs of system improvements for the public facilities to serve new development that will pay the impact fees m the police fire parks and streets public facilities included in the calculation of impact fees in the impact fee study will benefit all new development throughout the city and it is therefore appropriate to treat all areas of the city as a single service area for purposes of calculating collecting and spending the impact fees collected n there is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development impacts created by each type of development covered by this chapter and the impact fees that such development will be required to pay o this chapter

of small wind energy systems installed to reduce the on site consumption of utility supplied electricity and to do so in a manner that is consistent with prudent planning and the existing city ordinances b findings 1 the city of mountain home finds that wind energy is an abundant renewable and nonpolluting energy resource and that its conversion to electricity will reduce our dependence on nonrenewable energy resources and decrease the air and water pollution that results from the use of conventional energy sources  however wind energy systems must meet zoning and land use requirements as well as address issues related to their use in an urban environment evenly distributed small wind energy systems will also enhance the reliability and power quality of the power  sterling codifiers inc  195258 grid reduce peak power demands and help diversify the states energy supply portfolio when located properly small wind systems also make the electricity supply market more competitive by promoting customer choice 2 the state of idaho and the federal government have enacted a number of laws and programs to encourage the use of small scale renewable energy systems including rebates tax exemptions and net metering however many existing zoning ordinances contain restrictions which while not intended to discourage the installation of small wind turbines can substantially increase the time and costs required to obtain necessary construction permits therefore the city of mountain home finds that it is necessary to standardize and streamline the proper issuance of building permits for small wind energy systems so that this clean renewable energy resource can be utilized in a cost effective and timely manner c definitions small wind energy system a wind energy conversion system consisting of a wind turbine a tower and associated control or conversion electronics which has a rated capacity of not more than one hundred 100 kilowatts and which is intended to primarily reduce on
