the valley center kansas municipal originally published by book publishing company in 197 has been kept current by regular supplementation by matthew bender & company inc its successor in interest beginning with supplement no 5 municipal will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation during original codification the ordinances were compiled edited and indexed by the editorial staff of book publishing company under the direction of ronald h rogg city attorney the code is organized by subject matter under an expandable threefactor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions each section number designates in sequence the numbers of the title chapter and section thus located in of title 2 in most instances sections are numbered by tens 010 020 030 etc leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions similarly chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion in parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section this legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table following the text of the code listing by number all ordinances their subjects and where they appear in the codification  and beginning with supplement no 5 legislation can be tracked using the table and disposition list a subjectmatter index with complete crossreferencing locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers this supplement

officials city employees and private citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this system the numbering system is the backbone of a ordinances  municipal uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty definitions the titles in this separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable

systems wecs in the city of valley center and the surrounding three mile jurisdiction area subject to reasonable restrictions which will promote the conversion of wind energy to electricity while preserving the public health and safety b findings valley center finds that wind energy is an abundant renewable and nonpolluting energy resource and that its conversion to electricity will help to reduce dependence on nonrenewable energy resources and thereby decrease the air and water pollution that results from the use of conventional energy sources wind energy systems also enhance the reliability and power quality of the power grid reduce peak power demands and help diversify the states energy supply portfolio it is also recognized that issues related to aesthetics safety noise and effects on nearby property values are important in the siting and installation of wecs in valley center and the surrounding area therefore it is necessary to standardize and streamline the proper

nonconformities and exemptions see nonconformities and  for exemptions a purpose registration of nonconformities and exemptions among other purposes is to provide a property owner with a record of their nonconformity or exemption which may be in effect for many years such a record is very desirable since most nonconformities or exemptions are established in the past and the availability of personal witnesses and written documentation to confirm their status becomes more difficult due to the passage of time this is particularly important since the person claiming the nonconformity or exemption has the burden to prove their claim by the preponderance of the evidence registration can be especially useful to property owners who may have a nonconformity or exemption created by changing their zoning status from the unincorporated area of sedgwick county to the city zoning regulations b rights conditioned a lawfully established nonconformity including exemptions is a vested right protected by due process which is sometimes referred to as being grandfatheredin in order to establish such a right it is essential that it be created or commenced prior to the enactment of the regulations which restricted its establishment a nonconformity or exemption which violated the zoning regulations at its inception has no lawful right to continue once the validity of the nonconformity or exemption has been determined it has the right to be sold inherited transferred or assigned unless restricted by a condition attached to a special or conditional use certain limitations however may be placed on the expansion repair maintenance and continuance of such nonconformities or exemption as may be determined by the provisions of in these regulations for example continuance may be subjected to abandonment or limited amortization of certain uses c registration process the zoning administrator shall establish a process for registration of nonconformities and

provisions of these regulations in b2 and 3 it is the intent of these regulations to encourage the installation of public water supplies and public sewage disposal systems wherever feasible in order to determine such feasibility the planning commission may require the subdivider to provide certain basic engineering data and cost estimates on which to base such a decision furthermore if onlot water supply and sewage disposal installations are used additional lot area may be required if the area to be subdivided has a high water table is periodically flooded with water or if the soil conditions prove to be unsuitable based on percolations test which may be required of the subdivider when the alternative wastewater treatment system is used for sewage disposal the edge of the alternative wastewater treatment system must not be less than 300 feet from any existing offpremises dwelling or 100 feet from the nearest property line c in those areas where there may be municipaltype water andor sanitary sewer facilities anticipated in the foreseeable future but which are not yet available the planning commission may require that lots be so designed and arranged that they may readily be converted to urban type building sites without replatting when such a condition prevails land should be subdivided into lots so that by combining lots a building site is created initially with an area of not less than that required for onlot wells andor sewage treatment systems the creation of such a building site of multiple groups of lots shall be contingent upon the establishment for record of restrictive covenants satisfactory to the legal counsel of the planning commission providing that no more than one dwelling unit shall be built on   note all public
