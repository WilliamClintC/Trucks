citizens please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code numbering system the numbering system is the backbone of a code of ordinances  matthew bender & company inc uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this code it is based on three tiers beginning with title then chapter and ending with section each part is represented in the code section number for example in of title 2 title a title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled this code contains about 15 to 20 titles for example the first title is title 1 general provisions which may contain ordinances about the general penalty code adoption and definitions the titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference some titles are reserved for later use deal with more specific subjects and are often derived from one ordinance all of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title the chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information at the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title in addition each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections respectively note at the end of each code section you will find an ordinance history note which lists the underlying ordinances for that section the ordinances are listed by number section if applicable and year example  1992 this note will be updated by matthew bender & company inc as each section is amended with the most recent amendment added to the beginning the notation part is used when the code section contains only part of the ordinance or section of the ordinance specified  this indicates that there are other areas of the code affected by the same ordinance or section of the ordinance if the code section was derived from an earlier codification the last entry in the note indicates the old or prior code section number statutory references the statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality as the statutes are revised these references will be updated by matthew bender & company inc crossreference table when a code is based on an earlier codification the crossreference table will help users find older or prior code references in the new code the crossreference table is located near the end of the code under the tabbed divider tables this table lists the prior code section in the column labeled prior  and the new code section in the column labeled herein this table will be updated as prior code sections are renumbered or repealed disposition table to find a specific ordinance in the code turn to the section called tables for the disposition table this very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed by matthew bender & company inc the table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance if the ordinance is codified the chapter or chapters will be indicated example 204 612 904 if the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified such as budgets taxes annexations or rezones the disposition will be special if the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code usually at the direction of the municipality the disposition will be not codified when an ordinance is repealed the disposition will be changed by matthew bender & company inc to repealed by  with the appropriate ordinance number other dispositions sometimes used are tabled pending number not used or missing index if youre not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code start with the index this is an alphabetical multitier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference and crossreferences where necessary look for the main heading of the subject you need then the appropriate subheadings business license see also business tax fee  required when  the index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended insertion guide each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an insertion guide this guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement it will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current page numbers when originally published this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers as it is amended new material may require the insertion of new pages that are

neighborhood increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas therefore the limitation of nude conduct in establishments licensed to sell

article represents a balancing of competing interests reduced criminal activity and protection of neighborhoods regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons b findings based on the experience of other urban counties and municipalities including but not limited to atlanta and fulton county georgia  dekalb county georgia  augustarichmond county georgia  indianapolis indiana  athensclarke county georgia  marietta georgia  gwinnett county georgia  warner robins georgia  rome georgia  carrollton georgia  and smyrna georgia  which experiences we believe are relevant to the issues faced by the city of metter georgia the mayor and city council take note of the notorious and selfevident conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country moreover it is the findings of the mayor and city council that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct prostitution and drug trafficking and use among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood  increased expenditures for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order  increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior herein above described  and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas therefore the limitation of nude or partially nude conduct in establishments affects the public welfare  and it is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments that allow andor encourage nudity based on these findings this article is adopted to regulate certain types of businesses and to establish where such activity may or may not be conducted    definitions as used herein the following words or phrases shall have the following meanings

general provisions general provisions title this title shall be known and may be cited as the development agreement  of the city of metter    findings the need for a development agreement arises in instances where a landowner generally wishes to guarantee that a local governments land use regulations will remain fixed during the life of a prospective land development on a subject parcel the local government on the other hand seeks as many concessions and land development conditions as possible beyond what it could reasonably require regulations under the normal exercise of its authority or police power developers have an incentive to voluntarily enter into a development agreement with the city that will limit the property uses because the prospects exist that the local government will adopt and apply land use restrictions to said property in the future hence a development agreement would benefit a developer by locking in the development regulations that apply to a particular development even if the local government subsequently adopts land use regulations developers also have an incentive to voluntarily enter into a development agreement with the city for two other important reasons even if no land use regulations currently apply to a proposed development first the developer may need the cooperation of the city in extending infrastructure eg water and sewer lines drainage facilities roads utilities etc and such cooperation may not be forthcoming in the absence of concessions voluntarily submitted to by the developer in the form of a development agreement second knowledge of a pending development may stir citizen controversy and even if the city has no land use regulations the development agreement becomes a flexible negotiating instrument whereby the developer can submit to certain concessions ie limits on land uses that will satisfy neighborhood concerns the city similarly has interests in voluntarily entering into a development agreement in certain instances as just noted the city may have an interest in limiting land uses in a given area because of citizen opposition without the mechanism of a voluntary development agreement and in the absence of land use regulations the city has virtually no control over the quality extent and location of a proposed development the city will also support entering into development agreements in cases where infrastructure is needed to serve the development but no existing regulation exists to require such improvements the mayor and city council of the city of metter georgia therefore finds that a negotiated development agreement voluntarily submitted by a development applicant and involving infrastructure improvements and limits on land use regulations can be in the best interests of the city and the development community and within the proper scope of the citys police powers    purpose the purpose of a development agreement is to vest certain development rights in the landownerdeveloper in exchange for construction and dedication of public improvements certain restrictions on land uses and other concessions on the part of developer a development agreement allows a developer who needs additional discretionary approval now or in the future to acquire longterm project approval regardless of any local regulations that may be subsequently adopted development agreements will provide assurances to the applicant for a particular development project that upon approval of the project the applicant may proceed with the project in accordance with all applicable local statues ordinances resolutions rules and policies in existence at the time the development agreement is executed and that the project will not be restricted or prohibited by the citys subsequent enactment or adoption of laws ordinances resolutions rules or policies public benefits derived from development agreements may include but are not limited to restrictions on land uses limits on development intensity and location affordable housing design standards and on and offsite infrastructure and other improvements the local government needs a mechanism for negotiating such benefits in return for the vesting of development rights for a specific period it is therefore the specific purpose of this chapter to authorize the local governing body to exercise its police powers to enter into individual development agreements and to specify the content and procedures for such development agreements    authority to enter into development agreements the mayor and city council of the city of metter georgia hereby exercises its police powers to negotiate and enter into a voluntary development agreement upon application of a developer the procedure for entering into a development
