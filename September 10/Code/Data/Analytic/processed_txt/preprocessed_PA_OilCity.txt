control the adverse secondary effects of adultoriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens  protect the citizens property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of blight 2 the city has determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adultoriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 3 the city does not intend this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a contentneutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects of adultoriented businesses it is not the intent of the city enacting this legislation to deny any person their rights of speech protected by the constitution of the united states or the constitution of the commonwealth of pennsylvania or both nor is it the intent of the city to impose by this chapter any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials including sexually oriented films videotapes books and other materials further by enacting this chapter the city does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view or both any sexually oriented materials or conduct protected by the constitution of the united states or the constitution of commonwealth of pennsylvania or both nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors may have to sell distribute or exhibit these sexually oriented materials b legislative judicial and research findings the city finds 1 law enforcement personnel have determined and statistics and studies performed in a substantial number of communities in this commonwealth and in the united states have indicated that adultoriented businesses have adverse secondary effects including those specified and recognized at 68 pacsa  5501a which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the publics health safety and welfare these secondary effects include but are not limited to the spread of communicable diseases  the performance of sexual acts in public places  the presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on public and private property  sexual harassment  obscenity prostitution and other illegal sexual activities  crime  decreased property values and neighborhood deterioration 2 based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adultoriented businesses on the community as presented a in depositions and hearings conducted by the united states district  841 oil city code  841  court for the middle district of pennsylvania and the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania  b on findings incorporated in the following cases city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426 us 41 1976 and barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991  c from studies and reports from other cities throughout the country including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  biloxi mississippi  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and d on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota  the city finds a adultoriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments and there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises b certain employees of adultoriented businesses as defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidences of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than other employees of other establishments c sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at adultoriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows furthermore adult bookstores tend to attract homosexual men who engage in unprotected highrisk sexual activities offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions d persons frequent adult theaters adult arcades and other adultoriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such adultoriented businesses e at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adultoriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a and non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections f the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to the newborn  841 general provisions  841  g according to the best scientific evidence available aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts h sanitary conditions in some adultoriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain their facilities i numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in areas of adultoriented businesses where persons view adultoriented films j numerous studies have indicated that adultoriented businesses have a substantial negative impact on property values and cause neighborhood blight k the findings noted in 2a j raise substantial governmental concerns 3 adultoriented businesses have adverse secondary effects in the nature of creating a public nuisance which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare of the general public 4 adultoriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial government concerns 5 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of the adultoriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that their adultoriented businesses are run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adultoriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 6 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises that have adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters and bookstores 7 requiring licensees of adultoriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidences of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential  841 oil city code  841   842 definitions as used in this chapter the following word and phrases shall have the meanings indicated unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning adult arcade  any place in which the public is permitted or invited wherein coinoperated slugoperated or for any form of consideration witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 8 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the adultoriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexuallytransmitted diseases 9 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 10 the fact that an applicant for an adultorientedbusinessuse license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in the breach of the provisions of this chapter the barring of such individuals from the ownership andor management of adultoriented businesses in the city serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 11 the limitation of operating hours of adultoriented businesses from  am to  pm monday closure of such businesses on sunday and holidays reduces the adverse secondary effects of such businesses including in particular latenight noise levels crime sexually offensive materials and activities in public areas as well as promoting the public health safety and welfare 12 the reasonable regulation and supervision of adultoriented businesses tends to discourage sexual acts and prostitution and thereby promotes the health safety and welfare of patrons clients and customers of these businesses 13 the continued unregulated operation of such adultoriented businesses would be detrimental to the general health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city 14 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter

short title this chapter shall be known and may be cited as the city of oil city stormwater management   2742 statement of findings the governing body of the city of oil city finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpointsource pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the city of oil city and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  2741 general provisions  2743   2743 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote health safety and welfare within the city of oil city venango county by minimizing the

regulations at 25 pa to protect maintain reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the commonwealth b manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems c preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible d maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources e maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses f preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams and prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds g manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source with a minimum of structures and a maximum use of natural processes h provide procedures
