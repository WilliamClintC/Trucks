follow the guidelines contained in section 12501 word usage and section 12502 abbreviations administrators judicial figures and other persons shall interpret this chapter based on an understanding of the purposes intended by the town of davie town council as noted in this chapter and in the comprehensive plan the intent of the standards and supporting definitions is to protect both individual property owners and the general public from adverse impacts which might otherwise be the result of a proposed land use to this end those called upon to interpret this chapter shall proceed as follows a determine the public purposes of the standards with respect to which an interpretation is required commentary before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit identification of the purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable negative impact or potential a sound interpretation of any such standard cannot be ensured without a careful analysis of the end to which the regulation is directed b determine the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design but prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public commentary there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in this chapter design freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of standards is to be prohibited c determine that the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal commentary if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution which is more flexible albeit slightly different from the one expressly stated  and if it would result in no less a degree of protection to any affected party either the adjoining landowners the public at large or the property owner such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in an identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this chapter similarly any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this chapter any interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted should only be made when the party interpreting this chapter has the power to impose additional restrictions or conditions to protect the public and exercises this power d this chapter has been carefully designed by the town of davie town council to avoid regulations that either sacrifice legitimate public goals including the protection of adjoining property owners or require undue limitations on the ability of property owners to use their land in manners consistent with the goals of the comprehensive plan for the town great care has been taken to both balance the rights of competing groups and achieve maximum protection with flexibility and a range of use options  22190  exh a 12512 secs 1261219  reserved article ii

division 1  consistency and concurrency determinations generally a purpose it is the purpose of this section to implement the local government comprehensive planning and land development regulations act of 198 which requires that local governments adopt and maintain land development regulations that are consistent with and implement the adopted comprehensive plan florida statutes this section will describe requirements and procedures for determination of consistency of proposed development projects with the town of davies comprehensive plan hereinafter referred to as the comprehensive plan including meeting concurrency requirements of the plan b intent it is intended that no land development activity be approved unless it is found that such development activity is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable development regulations  further that such development activity shall not degrade the level of service los standards established in the comprehensive plan for roads sanitary sewer potable water drainage solid waste and recreational facilities this section is designed to ensure that adequate facilities are in place concurrent with the impact of the new development c determining consistency with the davie comprehensive plan if a development proposal is found to meet all the requirements of this chapter it shall be presumed to be consistent with the comprehensive plan the director of development services shall verify the consistency of a development proposal with the comprehensive plan prior to issuance of a development permit  22190 concurrency management a generally the following method of ensuring concurrency shall be known as the system for the management of concurrency symcon the symcon is based upon the comprehensive plan and level of service standards adopted herein the system is designed to ensure that the cumulative effects of proposed development activity will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services the symcon also includes a monitoring system for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards all applications for plat site plan or building permit approval shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the town notwithstanding the foregoing the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met b determination of available capacity for purposes of these regulations the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by 1 calculating the total design capacity of existing and proposed facilities operating at the required level of service and available concurrent with the impact of the proposed development 2 subtracting from that number the sum of the capacity demand for the service created by existing or previously approved development and the new capacity demand for the service that will be created concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development a plat site plan or building permit subject to an adequacy determination shall be approvable only if one or more of the following is shown i the facilities necessary to provide adequate levels of service are in place at the time the impacts of development occur ii construction of the new facilities necessary to provide adequate levels of service is under way at the time of development approval iii the necessary facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities to be constructed within a period of time as stipulated in the contract or for the provision of services at the time the development permit is issued iv the necessary facilities have been funded in the current fiscal year budget of the town county or state capital improvement program v the necessary facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development agreement an enforceable development agreement may include but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to florida statutes or an agreement or development order pursuant to florida statutes such facilities must be consistent with the capital improvements element of the towncounty comprehensive plan and approved by the town vi the developer has contributed funds to the towncounty necessary to provide the necessary facilities consistent with the capital improvements element of the towncounty comprehensive plan commitment that the facilities will be built must be evidenced by an appropriate budget amendment and appropriation by the towncounty or other applicable governmental entity c burden of showing compliance on developer the burden of showing compliance with adopted levels of service standards shall be that of the developer in order to be approvable applications for development approval shall provide sufficient and verifiable information showing compliance with these standards the development services department shall supply concurrency management forms to be

the town of davie generally bordered by university drive i595 floridas turnpike and the c11 canal adjacent to griffin road the total area designated regional activity center on the land use plan map exceeds two thousand two hundred 2200 acres of which more than seven hundred fifty 750 acres are part of the south florida education center sfec the sfec is a collection of educational institutions located in proximity to one another and sometimes sharing campus space the purpose of creating the regional activity center land use plan designation was to enable the town to comprehensively plan for the area as one 1 mixeduse unit thereby coordinating land use with transit opportunities and capitalizing on the potential of the sfec to grow creating spinoff research and product development as well as housing opportunities in areas designated for redevelopment both of which would contribute to the economic feasibility of redeveloping downtown davie several years later the metropolitan planning organization mpo working with the federal transit administration fta and florida department of transportation fdot began planning the preliminary design for eastwest rapid transit along the interstate 595 corridor the sfec was seen as a major contributor to potential ridership the town of davie subsequently contracted with a multidisciplinary team to complete a yearlong master plan study of the entire regional activity center the master plan targets urbanscale redevelopment of community and regional significance that is keyed to a longterm mass transit strategy of developing transit corridors peripheral parking facilities and greenways that are coordinated with a proposed central broward eastwest transit station location at the northern terminus of college avenue the master plan adopted in 2006 by the town serves as a blueprint for creating an eastern mixeduse village premised upon the unique collaborative opportunities for redevelopment and economic development related to the sfec as a resource and transit and other modes of mobility as the other vital component that would facilitate the area known as the regional activity center in fulfilling its land use designation as a redevelopment of regional significance these land development regulations and design standards are intended to implement the adopted master plan the entire report on these phases of work can be

encourages significant regional redevelopment the districts have an opportunity to integrate the unique educational culture of the sfec to create an unparalleled location to live work and play the rac districts promote the development of a pedestrian and transitoriented mixeduse community vertical mixing of uses transitsupportive intensities and the shaping of urban form in order to account for the large scale and varying conditions of the rac districts it is imperative that priorities and flexibility be built into regulating the redevelopment of the area understanding the intent for each district is important as redevelopment occurs therefore the principles that implement the intent for each district are listed for review flexibility has been built into the regulations in the form of the design adjustment process see section 1243823 the principles listed throughout these regulations serve as performance criteria used to evaluate site plans permits and requests for design adjustment it is the intent of these regulations to encourage redevelopment by providing certainty and predictability in the development review process certain direction as to the desired development outcome it is also the intent of these regulations to encourage redevelopment consistent with certain objectives of these regulations as outlined in section 124389f by substantially expediting the standard site plan review process and by providing intensity andor financial incentives  by replacing the variance hardship process with a designoriented variation process that offers more flexibility and predictability  and by requiring fewer offstreet parking spaces and providing for flexible parking location the adopted rac master plan established several objectives that the rac district regulations are intended to implement as follows it is important that these regulations be evaluated periodically to ensure that all necessary steps are being taken to implement the rac master plan transitoriented development a a parkonce philosophy  shared privatepublic structured or interim surface parking is encouraged at strategic locations with connecting shuttle service b achieve a reduction in roadway congestion abovereferenced peripheral shared parking opportunities as well as convenient and enticing pedestrian ways and convenient transit service c establish onstreet parking throughout the rac districts in order that a larger proportion of private property can be developed reliance on offstreet parking  and to enhance the walkability of streets by slowing the speed of traffic and buffering sidewalks from vehicular traffic d establish a core area of regional transitsupportive uses and intensity transitoriented development shall be a key component e strongly encourage buildout to the highest permissible density and intensity within onehalf 12 mile of the proposed eastwest regional transit station at the college avenue and sr 84 intersection open space and connectivity f encourage the provision of areawide water retention via curvilinear canals and water bodies with adjacent pedestrian ways to transform surface drainage features into greenways where areawide drainage infrastructure is not available encourage the use of underground stormwater vaults for retention g gradually create a systematic and interconnected openpublic space component that serves the functions of greenspace relief from an urban environment recreation and a conduit for pedestrian and bicycle travel h achieve a street network that offers alternative routes via parallel streets i encourage a variety of pedestrian bicycle and vehicular routes that provide appropriate connections to surrounding roadways j provide pedestrian and bicycle amenities to encourage these modes of mobility establish regionally significant uses with links to sfec k provide flexibility in the permitted uses of land while not precluding reuse for the primary intended uses nor precluding infill of urban intensity examples include allowing several uses within a building that is designed to ultimately house a research and product development use or future ground floor retail that may not be supported by current market conditions l whenever a site is developed at a relatively low intensity relative to the maximum permitted intensity the site and improvements thereon should be designed and constructed to enable buildout of the site at the maximum allowable intensity at some future time without the need for substantial demolition known as beginning with the end in mind this approach may for example involve designing and constructing buildings to accommodate vertical expansion and designing surface parking lots to eventually accommodate a parking structure housing and residential density m allow and encourage a variety of housing types and price points maximum densities creative dwelling configurations mixing of uses incentives and accessory dwellings n to the extent that comprehensive plan density and rac future land use plan category provisions permit the number of dwelling units that can be constructed on a lot shall be governed by building and site design and not a maximum density calculation urban form o encourage visual interest by ensuring the building and visual landscapes are accented rather than their parking facilities p bring buildings to the roadway ensure proper proportioning and require continuous building facades to enclose designated streets in order to help create a lively and visually appealing environment that invites people to live locate businesses and spend time shopping dining and interacting with others q require the location of onsite parking facilities in the rear yard accessed when possible alleys or side streets

cases wide sidewalks and buildings placed close to the street and built to the side lot lines in order to provide a sense of enclosure to the street corridor 2 transitoriented streets are primarily located within a five 5 minute walk from existing or planned regional transit stops the south florida education center or downtown davie 3 transitoriented development is encouraged along these streets in order that a sufficient mix and intensity of uses exists to support transit use and minimize the need for private automobile travel for those working shopping getting an education andor living on or near such a street 4 retail restaurant and entertainment uses are encouraged on the ground floor but are not required residential development on upper floors is encouraged 5 the mix of these uses is needed to ignite a vibrant street experience and offer a mix in shopping destinations 6 buildings along transitoriented streets should be architecturally interesting 7 transitoriented streets should be framed by urban blocks the characteristics of urban blocks are identified in section 124388 components of place  streets and blocks 8 the intersection of sw 30th street and university drive is located directly on the trunk line transit network and should be considered an urban transitoriented node additional planning and urban design should occur for this area to ensure an efficient location of the transit stop park and ride facilities center of activity residential areas secondary areas and new connectors and local streets where necessary 9 the following intersections are located on a local feeder bus line within ten 10 minutes travel time from a trunk transit line additional planning and urban design should occur for the area around these intersections to ensure an

frontage on such streets shall be structurally designed to accommodate firststory nonresidential use minimum floortoceiling ground floor height and must contain at least two 2 stories additionally buildings that will have at least fifty 50 percent of their street frontage situated within four hundred 400 feet of the center of the intersection of any two 2 transitoriented streets are required to have a minimum of two 2 use types as classified on table 124387c ex retail and office retail and residential etc ground floor street frontage on all transitoriented streets shall consist of

124389e intensity of use standards and table 1243810c site development standards regulate developments fronting transit oriented streets separately from development within the same zoning district but not fronting a transitoriented street for example a property fronting nova drive a transitoriented street is regulated in the listed tables under the column transitoriented street and not under the

area and open space such regulation shall control over the corresponding zoning district regulations for the entirety of the building and lot with frontage on the transitoriented street except as provided in b below b it is the intent of these regulations that lots fronting transitoriented streets be part of urban blocks as characterized in section 124388 components of place  streets and blocks however this urban block requirement as it applies to lot and block depth is not mandatory in the raced racrtw and racrte districts which contain some large parcels in excess of one hundred 100 acres and which may or may not be subdivided into numerous smaller frontage blocks and lots to the extent that the transitoriented street frontage of very large parcels is not divided into blocks consistent with the dimensions in section 124388 for example a 50acre campustype development with only one 1 access road onto a transitoriented street the regulations applicable to development fronting transitoriented streets shall be applied to each entire block fronting a transitoriented street or the first six hundred 600 feet of lot depth a basic block depth dimension measured inward

college avenue  east davie road  west sw 71 st terrace 2 district intent and character it is the intent of this district to promote regionally significant development that includes research and product development r&d facilities that compliment the education and research institutions of the sfec and offer the possibility of adaptive reuse of existing warehouse buildings new developments must be sensitive to the existing cemetery key multimodal connections along college avenue and davie road are vital to the overall success of this district the potential for regional eastwest transit along interstate 595 calls for highintensity residential and employment development and public parking facilities to serve the entire regional activity center proximate to this potential transit alignment centered near the northern terminus of college avenue at sr 84 3 development pattern it is the intent of this district that the existing street network of northsouth and eastwest streets be maintained and enhanced by infilling the existing superblocks see figure 5062 below with additional streets created as the area redevelops over time a master street plan should be developed that determines approximately where new and extended streets should occur to substantially improve eastwest connectivity within this district and where midblock alleys are feasible and should be provided it is further intended that buildings will be placed close to and oriented towards perimeter streets in order to contribute to pedestrian activity on the streets and the attendant viability of retail and service establishments accordingly parking should be internalized within a block behind the buildings given the existing superblock pattern it is expected that some blocks will continue to exceed the ideal dimensions identified in section 124388 components of place  streets and blocks after dedications are made within superblocks it is permissible for there to be considerable internal building orientation provided that perimeter buildings must still engage edgeperimeter streets  that parking is located behind the buildings  and that pedestrian connections within and external to the development are provided figure 5062 below illustrates the superblock pattern that consists of large blocks with a considerable number of internal buildings oriented to parking facilities the superblock is contrasted in the graphic with a basic urban block representative of a future condition in the ractc district where all buildings front and engage the street and rear access is often provided via alleys for parking and loading functions the only autooriented street is sr 84 which is characterized by high speeds and few traffic lights in contrast to the remainder of the district properties fronting sr 84 are required to provide a landscaped separation from the roadway 4 principles and objectives a shared structured parking proximate to the proposed i595 and college avenue transit station with connecting shuttle service b the college avenue davie road and nova drive corridors should support and compliment the functions of the sfec by providing residential opportunities and supporting retail and service opportunities c reuse or redevelopment of industrial parcels for r&d technology businesses and other university support uses as well as residences and neighborhood

road alignment to the south floridas turnpike to the east and davie road to the west 2 district intent and character high potential for immediate development is the focus for this district it is the intent of this district to promote regionally significant development that includes largescale commercial development and r&d that is complimentary to the educational and research institutions of the sfec more than one hundred 100 acres of lake can potentially be filled and developed it is recognized that commercial or r&d use of these properties will likely serve as a catalyst for urban infill and redevelopment of the rac mixing of retail and office uses with residential is encouraged 3 development pattern there is no established street pattern within this district which is comprised of large parcels and water the regulations governing development within this district allow for flexible use of land provided that key multimodal connections are provided as shown on the adopted rac master plan consisting of the proposed oakes road extension west over floridas turnpike to davie road and the extension of reese road south to oakes road the master plan also encourages the creation of an additional eastwest corridor in the vicinity of nova drive or to its north that will connect davie road with reese road reese road is considered an autooriented street where it parallels 84 and floridas turnpike 4 principles and objectives a development of wellplanned largescale commercial office entertainment lodging r&d and technology uses with a residential component b catalyzing redevelopment of davies regional activity center and serving as a major draw of people to the area c provide additional tax base for the town in an appropriate location 5 requirements a permitted uses

west college avenue in the southern portion of the raced and the southerly extension of sw 71 terrace in the northern portion of the raced encompassing the university of florida agricultural field station 2 district intent and character this district is unique to the others in that it is primarily occupied by educational entities including broward county school district  broward county community college  florida atlantic university  university of florida ifas  mc fatter vocational center  and nova southeastern university together these schools are known as the south florida education center sfec the focus of this district is to reduce vehicular impact on area roads as well as maximize land available for educational purposes for the car to no longer dominate the landscape on these campuses mobility alternatives must be provided and parking should be centralized and structured with connections to transit surface lots should be infilled with shared parking garages and education facilities strong multimodal connections throughout the campuses are also vital along college drive and davie road key pedestrian connections to the library and performing arts center centrally located in the district are encouraged 3 development pattern the district is mainly comprised of educational campuses characterized by a minimal number of roadways and general lack of interconnectivity but also characterized as relatively cohesive and master planned developments on large parcels with focal and centralized open spaces and a pedestrian network that can be further enhanced the campuses are characterized by outlying onsite parking facilities with a parkonce philosophy it is the intent of this district to further develop the parkonce philosophy by locating the parking offcampus proximate to the proposed eastwest regional transit along the interstate 595 corridor with connecting northsouth local transit achievement of this objective has the potential to reduce traffic congestion in and around the campuses and to increase developable land on the campuses by reducing the amount of campus space that is occupied or planned for parking facilities 4 principles and objectives a reduction of surface parking replaced by structured parking and new buildings with ground floor retail and service uses oriented towards college avenue and nova drive b offcampus parking on the perimeter of the rac with transit connections to the sfec campuses c the college avenue davie road and nova drive corridors should support and compliment the functions of the sfec by providing residential opportunities and supporting retail and service opportunities for this to occur the colleges would need to eliminate much of the existing surface parking along college avenue and replace it with structured parking and intervening buildings that front college avenue 5 requirements a permitted uses for this district can be found in table 124387c b intensity standards

fulfill the ultimate possibility for this district 3 development pattern the existing street network is a modified grid characterized by missing street segments and large water body interruptions to the grid the network should be modified where possible to most closely approach an urban grid pattern for improved mobility within the neighborhood 4 principles and objectives a establish onstreet parking and rear alleys serving rearyard parking where possible to create more walkable streets b new and remodeled dwellings should be located closer to the street and utilize front porch design c the focus of redevelopment should be to maintain the singlefamily character of the neighborhood but to allow higher densities in the form of duplexes townhomes and even multiplefamily structures provided the building design and architectural characteristics are consistent with those of either attached or detached singlefamily homes including but not limited to scale mass proportions strategic use of entryways roof design and facade design and articulation the illustrations that follow demonstrate the use of one 1 exterior entrance to serve two 2 or more dwelling units from an interior foyer the first two 2 illustrations appear to be singlefamily detached dwellings because of both the internalization of some unit entrances and a single cohesive building design that lacks the repeating elements that would visually identify each dwelling unit within the building as is typically seen in duplexes and townhomes figure 5064 figure 5064 these buildings each contain three 3

architectural detail in streetscape amenities and building facades to increase interest appearance and richness in the pedestrian experience f provide views to intriguing vistas to help entice people to walk longer distances g design intersections to reduce crossing distances provide clearly marked crosswalks that are aligned with sidewalks and provide automatic crosswalk signals 3 alternate parallel paths of travel enhance all modes of mobility and reduce reliance on single multilane and highspeed arterials and collectors that inhibit pedestrian and bicycle activity this in turn enables multilane roadways to incorporate onstreet parking and wider sidewalks both of which enhance retail and pedestrian activity the creation of new and extended streets where shown on the adopted rac master plan and conceptualized within the district development pattern provisions of section 124386 will enhance overall connectivity within the rac three 3 major road connections include oakes road between sr 7 and davie road the extension of reese road to oakes road and the creation of an additional eastwest street in the vicinity of nova drive or north 4 symbols of the community defining a character for each street type allows visitors to be more aware of the function of the street street scale and symbols along the street improves way finding ability and creates a unique sense of place

area where a building faces the street and meets with the sidewalk is generally referred to as the building frontage it is here that the interaction occurs between people on the sidewalk and businesses in the buildings there are three 3 main reasons for controlling building frontage 1 to define the edge of each street corridor thereby establishing a sense of enclosure 2 to ensure a high level of pedestrian interest visually interesting facades close to the sidewalk and interactive facades allowing the pedestrian to view inside and those inside to monitor the sidewalk and street 3 to increase commerce by supporting a high level of activity along the street therefore buildings should align their facades along the build to line street level restaurants shops stores and offices are all accessed at that line and the more continuous it is the greater possibility for success they will all experience gaps in between buildings will create areas of low activity and low commercial potential in the same way a vacant lot will and should be avoided wherever possible building frontages are controlled by buildtolines and minimum and maximum setbacks which are regulated by the types of streets that they front which often correlate to a given rac district b all buildings on lots with transitoriented street frontage shall have their principal frontage ie main entrance and

the maximum permitted height within a district exceeds the greater of four 4 stories or sixty five 65 feet allowable building heights shall stepup from the facade facing arterial and collector streets these height contours shall allow additional height on a  vertical to horizontal basis until the district maximum is reached except as provided below for example to achieve a building height of ninety 90 feet that portion of the building exceeding sixtyfive 65 feet would have to be set back an additional twentyfive 25 feet from the building face along the collector or arterial street this can be accomplished in as many increments as desired see figure 5121 below no such stepup shall be required adjacent to floridas turnpike or the i595sr 84 corridor including reese road frontage figure 5121 2 buildings exceeding either three 3 stories or thirtyfive 35 feet in height shall employ one 1 or more of the following techniques for ensuring compatibility with an abutting conforming singlefamily detached residence as deemed acceptable and effective by the town a reduce the perceived mass of the building and the height differential by stepping the building down on the sides abutting the singlefamily detached residence b provide adequate separation between buildings to minimize the perceived height difference and lower the lineofsight from the taller building to the singlefamily property c use appropriate landscape materials and buffering techniques to screen the taller building from the singlefamily residence and obstruct the line of sight between the buildings d for upper story windows use glass block low awnings or high windows to obstruct line of sight to the singlefamily property andor the strategic location of building functions and windows to maximize privacy for the singlefamily lot e use green landscaped terraces to obstruct lineofsite to the singlefamily property figure 5122 figure 5122 illustrates a combination of techniques including the use of stepdowns in height to reduce mass and height differential trees and landscaped terraces to block line of site and provide a buffer varying the horizontal plane of the facade and using color variations also reduces the apparent mass of the building figure 5123 figure 5124 these are examples of green terraces that can be employed to afford privacy between buildings and soften the impact of larger taller buildings such use of landscaping can also assist with stormwater capture and building energy efficiency 3 frontage on a transitoriented street can be developed to six 6 stories and ninetyfive 95 feet without any horizontal stepping if at least onehalf 12 of the lots street frontage is located within two hundred and fifty 250 feet of the center of the intersection of any two 2 transitoriented

rightofway should be envisioned as a primary place of activity using and invigorating the rightofway along the streets is the single most important element to redeveloping a pedestrianfriendly multimodal community the rightofway will incorporate vehicular pedestrian and bicycle improvements the town and the private developer should work together to make sure there is a seamless relationship between building entrances plazas sidewalks and crosswalks a continuous attractive and enjoyable experience is the goal for the pedestrian the public rightofway will serve the community by offering places for activities such as sidewalk seating people watching waiting on transit small gatherings and street vendor opportunities in order for a safe and comfortable pedestrian experience to be achieved shelter from sun and rain is encouragedthrough continuous awnings covered walks landscape and umbrella coverage of the sidewalk b principles 1 pedestrian experience and amenities should be the priority when allocating funds for rightofway improvements  no longer should rightofway improvements be solely focused on the automobile 2 building occupants are encouraged to add elements such as decorative pots cafe seating and awnings in areas of the sidewalk approved by the town 3 pervious pavers and extensive plant beds added to the public use areas are encouraged to reduce storm water

variation in surface plane such as brise soleil balconies building projections etc repetitive moderations are discouraged b the first thirtyfive 35 feet of the exterior facade vertical plane should enhance the pedestrian environment by incorporating appropriate architectural features such features include cornice molding stringcourses ornamentations changes in material or color and other sculpting of the architectural surface which add special interest and are compatible with public sector site elements 2 pedestrian bridges extending over public rightofway may be permitted providing those connections have secured legitimate air rights over the public corridor and meet all applicable codes the location of pedestrian bridges should be limited to building complexes where buildings share common needsuses or when the interaction between users of the buildings is important for the success of the use a connection over sr 84 to future eastwest rapid transit is considered a necessity once the transit infrastructure is in place all over street connections should be of exceptional design which enhance the visual and functional quality of the streetscape and should be compatible with

requirements a intent and applicability this section is intended to minimize both the actual and perceived presence and dominance of parking facilities within designated corridors by prescribing the location of and access to parking facilities via the rear of properties away from the street and by minimizing the potential for overparking which occurs when there is an oversupply of parking spaces it is also the intent of these regulations to encourage the provision of strategically centralized public parking with transit connections and onstreet parking that further reduces the amount of offstreet parking that must be provided the parking paradigm used in this section reflects an urbanizing but not yet urban area where alternate modes of transportation and shared parking facilities begin to reduce demand for parking spaces as strategically located centralized public parking is provided and multimodal infrastructure and service improves over time the parking space requirements should be adjusted to reflect the modal shift that is expected to occur parking and loading requirements and vehicular use area design geometrics shall comply with except as provided in this section b

these regulations require buildings to occupy the entire width of a lot offstreet parking facilities must be provided in the rear yard accessed by a side street or an alley or contiguous rear parking areas with access that together function like an alley if no such infrastructure exists driveway access is permitted as follows however it is required that new development be designed in a way to create opportunity for these connections to be made when adjacent lots are redeveloped in the future 1 when vehicular access is necessary within the street frontage it will be limited to a single curb cut for access in and out provided two 2 oneway drives may be permitted if necessary for parking facility circulation 2 additional driveways may be permitted for lots where sufficiently high trip

crossaccess easements 5 as redevelopment occurs connections shall be made between rear parking lots on neighboring lots this connectivity will reduce the need for curb cuts along the street and allow opportunity for those driveways to be redeveloped for building frontage paseos or outdoor building space 6 in order to encourage existing developed lots to connect their rear parking facilities to those of adjoining lots up to five 5 percent of the required parking may be eliminated if logistically necessary to provide said connections parking facilities that are nonconforming as to required number of spaces by five 5 percent or more shall not qualify c alleys few blocks in the rac are bisected by alleys the benefit of rear alleys are that they allow for a continuous building frontage and fewer vehiclepedestrian conflicts alleys may be incorporated into rear parking lots as standard drive aisles d throughblock pathways paseos throughblock pathways refer to interior onsite pedestrian walkways that are not located within a public right of way but may be located on public property the alignment of these pathways where required shall take into account pedestrian connections shown in the comprehensive plan proposed and existing buildings and to the extent possible property lines to enhance the pedestrian environment and connections to adjacent property paseos shall be designed to enhance the surrounding buildings and to provide community amenities e parking placement and design the intent of parking placement regulations is to deemphasize parking lots from the public streetscape and to provide an environment conducive to pedestrian activity by locating parking lots and their access away from street frontages where the following provisions shall apply strategically located peripheral public parking facilities with transit bicycle and pedestrian connections are specifically encouraged 1 no surface parking shall be located within twentyfive 25 feet of any street

authorized by a level one 1 adjustment 12 where no onstreet parking exists along transitoriented street frontages the town may allow up to one 1 double loaded corridor in front of buildings designed for retail and entertainment uses if crossaccess to other frontyard parking facilities exists or will be provided such that the parking connections will allow for continuous circulation without utilizing the street the required pedestrian zone and buildtoline shall be established at the back edge of the parking facility as if it were the frontage line intent parking in front of a retailtype uses is a proven necessity for the success of such businesses 13 offsite parking facilities are permitted within the rac districts if the offsite parking facility is more than one thousand two hundred fifty 1250 feet from the development site seeking to utilize the offsite spaces transit service with a maximum fifteen 15 minute headway between the parking facility and development site must exist or be planned with committed funding within five 5 years of issuance of a building permit for the development site the owner of the offsite parking facility shall enter into written arrangement with the town whereby the land providing the parking area shall never be sold or disposed of except in conjunction with the sale of the building the parking area serves so long as the offsite parking

sense of green these planting areas will contribute immeasurably to the districts visual pleasure especially in the enjoyment of natural outdoor amenities in addition to these a consideration to preserve the natural materials should be given as well as attempt to utilize indigenous materials when adding to the planting the following guidelines offer both functional as well as aesthetic information 2 ground plane materials shrub materials in their wide variety of forms colors and textures provide the basis for visual interest and spatial definition below eye level when properly used masses of shrub material can become the unifying element in the landscape bringing diverse landscape elements into overall harmony through contrasting variations in form and texture seasonal color displays ground plane materials also contribute much to the variety and interest of the landscape 3 upper story materials upper story materials will provide aesthetic and functional value to the

sites will be the provision of shade and relief from the summer heat especially in open areas of high pedestrian usage maximum impact of the sun will usually occur to the west and southwest of tall structures tree materials are excellent shade producing elements but different tree types are useful in different circumstances trees with large leaves and a dense canopy produce heavy shade under their crown single trees will provide islands of shade while groups of trees spaced either formally or informally at intervals can form a bosque effect which can make large areas useful for daytime activities since consistent shade may hinder growth of other plants beneath such trees it is recommended that bosques only occur in predominately paved areas or else care is taken to under plant with shade tolerant species while shrubs and ground cover do not produce shade directly useful to humans they are highly beneficial in reducing ground temperatures and evaporation from the soil and in moderating reflection and glare in the design of areas for maximum daily use the dynamics of solar movement must be understood so that trees may be located for maximum shade advantage sun angles and altitudes determine the best location for trees in relation to use areas whenever public spaces adjoin private development the shade provided by buildings should be utilized beyond the building shadow however canopy trees can effectively extend the total amount of comfortable surface area available smaller less formal areas such as tot lots may require only intermediate sized trees due to the reduced scale of the space small intimate spaces such as unit terraces may be successfully shaded with a single small tree shade trees bauhinia spp orchid tree bursera simaruba gumbo limbo calophyllum

laurel oak quercus virginiana live oak 7 screening a second consideration in the use of plant materials relates to their adaptability in the screening of use areas and to protect and enhance project elements dense planting along streets and drives can soften vehicle noise as well as aid in the filtration of dust from the air all levels of planting contribute to the screening of streets and parking areas proper placement of under story plant materials can eliminate headlight glare from approaching vehicles planting can be introduced to take advantage of cooling breezes as well as to mitigate the effects of major winds considered undesirable project elements proper species selection and plant placement can funnel breezes to desired areas plant materials are highly useful in the visual screening of unsightly views such as exposed utilities storage areas loading areas or parking lots efforts should be made to identify areas which are potentially distractive to the visual environment and employ screening with plant materials through deliberate placement plant materials especially trees can direct a persons view to an important area in the same way planting can enclose a view when planting along public streets consider the door swing of vehicle stopped at the curb avoid situations where plant materials will interfere with easy door opening or ingressegress of the driver if there is a conflict the plant materials will eventually become damaged screening coccooloba uvifera sea grape eugenia foetida spanish stopper ficus rubiginosa rusty fig podocarpus macrophyllus podocarpus treatment of the area below a tree should consider the variety and the amount of area surrounding the tree heavily used areas should use a tree grate softer materials can be used in less intense situations nearly every vehicle has an overhang it is necessary to remember this when landscaping around streets parking lots etc the overhang can occur at either end of the vehicle often oil can drip from the vehicles this can damage plant materials placed to close to the vehicles 8 design simplicity a natural plant association may contain thousands of plants and these may have many diverse forms and space relations nevertheless there exists even in nature the strict unity of one 1 governing element that links the parts in any plant composition there should be a predominance of material color or texture to give needed unity accent material should then be introduced to play against the dominant material creating the needed contrast a complicated planting scheme except in unique situations is seldom as successful as simple masses with a predominant species to provide unity and a few individual accent plants these principles apply to all scales of development with masses and accents occurring in greater size and number but retaining the same proportional philosophical approach simplicity and strength should describe the rac development district planting plant material should be clustered to create a feeling of mass at the same time there needs to be enough variety of plant material to suggest richness equal attention needs to be paid to the ground plane ground cover plants need to be selected with as much care as trees and shrubs careful selection of groundcovers can add exciting colors and textures to the ground plane whenever possible use ground covers in lieu of grass once established ground covers will require less constant maintenance 9 color the use of blooming plants will be a major objective of all areas of the rac development district it should be an aesthetic goal of all public sector development to utilize flowering material throughout rac development district the use of perennial plants to anchor planting massing and annual blooming plants should provide a rotation of seasonal color permanently planted materials should occur in large bold masses of unified color with consideration given to their textural scale and compatibility with adjacent materials during periods when they are not in bloom the use of temporary blooming plants can be accomplished in ground and container grown plant material

encouraged to submit for conceptual approval prior to finalizing and submitting a formal site plan application conceptual approval offers the developer an immediate opportunity to obtain feedback from the towns planning professionals and town council as to the project design architecture application for incentive bonuses and if necessary design variations see 1243823 below the conceptual approval process submittal requirements application fee and schedules shall be established administratively  1exh a  exh a 12 12512   variations in design  administrative relief a intent and purpose the rac districts differ from many other zoning districts within the town because of its emphasis on design principles and because it seeks to combine different use types within buildings and development sites rather than separate them and to encourage an urban intensity of development and form in order to accomplish this several areas of the rac districts have specific prescribed development standards rather than minimums and maximums to define the urban form of future development given this level of specificity throughout an area as large in breadth as the rac districts requests for variation from the standards and requirements can occasionally be expected in order to account for the variation in conditions within the rac districts and the difficulty of accounting for them in a designspecific regulation requests for variation can also be expected to facilitate design interpretations and alternatives that work as well or better than the prescribed standard finally some aspects of site development and design have not been prescribed or because the sheer size and variation of conditions and objectives within the rac districts made this prohibitive in some such cases the intent of the regulations may be executed with slight variation based on the specifics of the site adjacent street and uses and development proposal for all of these reasons the variance process of section 12309 has been supplanted by a designbased variation process that shifts the focus of review from hardship to design and logistics issues however variances still apply to code provisions not specific to the rac districts and to the intensity standards of the rac districts b procedure 1 the town council is authorized to approve variations to the standards and requirements of this division provided that variations from the intensity standards of this division are subject to the variance process 2 design variations associated with site plan and site plan modifications shall be considered as part of such site plan or modification applications 3 submittal requirements shall be established administratively 4 the town council shall evaluate each request for design variation based upon the criteria set forth in this section and may approve approve with conditions or deny such request after conducting an advertised quasijudicial public hearing pursuant to the requirements applicable to site plan approval c standard of review for design variations the town use the following criteria to base decisions to approve approve with conditions or deny requests for design variation 1 whether the request is for a reasonable accommodation of design flexibility that results in overall superior development and design consistent with the intent and principles of this division that govern the standard for which variation is requested  or 2 whether the variation is appropriate to accommodate site conditions not anticipated in these regulations or to reconcile conflicting requirements provided the request is generally consistent with the intent and principles of the this division that govern the standard for which variation is requested  1exh a  exh a 12 12512   building design guidelines for areas designated western theme overlay district this section shall be superseded by the western theme development manual a architectural articulation architectural articulation describes the treatment of facades and building massing that ultimately form a significant part of the individual buildings expression and by extension the quality of the built environment overall 1 principles a increased articulation at ground level and at levels where people interact directly with the building promotes a more human scale b increased articulation at primary facades those on major thoroughfares is appropriate to provide a sense of hierarchy in the visual environment c individual buildings can have varied approaches to architectural articulation with respect to each other but should have a consistent approach within a single building in terms of proportion limited material mix etc d articulation should generally be arranged so to emphasize the vertical over the horizontal in proportion b architectural landmarks architectural landmarks are significant buildings that help anchor important public spaces they help create hierarchy within the built environment with respect to the open spaces that they define and create common points of focus and reference within the built environment 1 principles a architectural landmarks should be located in prominent locations and at the end of important vistas as they become reference points and anchors b architectural landmarks should have a building program that speaks to the community as a whole and is used by the broader public c architectural landmarks should have programs with frequent use and large numbers of people  they naturally become focuses of energy within a city d traditionally architectural landmarks have been city halls post offices religious facilities theaters and museums e private buildings can be considered for architectural landmark status based on the nature and quantity of use a significant campus building for instance would be an appropriate example f an approved landmark building is encouraged to create a unique architectural expression to help it stand out within the built context g the landscape andor plaza space in front and around an architectural landmark should also be of higher quality unique and take into consideration the larger space or sequence of spaces that it is anchoring h architectural landmarks typically are articulated with more monumental or larger scale architectural elements designed again to give prominence i architectural landmark buildings are encouraged to be in use for during as many different parts of the day and night as possible gathering and activity are recommended 2 requirements a a building program must be reviewed for confirmation of architectural landmark status by virtue of proposed position in master plan use and quality of proposed building b an approved landmark building should be given special consideration with respect to the zoning requirement that apply to typical buildings such allowances would be as follows 1 additional height if warranted not typical of landmarks 2 additional density 3 reduced setbacks 4 increased design flexibility styles and materials that might otherwise be considered based on the quality of design c fenestration fenestration refers to the building openings windows etc that provide natural light to the interior of the built environment and also form a significant part of a buildings architectural expression the treatment of the fenestration is critical in both defining visually the built form of buildings managing and providing natural light to the interior of spaces and effecting energy use as a product of heat gain by the sun 1 principles a there should be an orderly relationship among windows doors porches and roof forms b windows and openings should tend to be vertical in proportion c areas with large glazed surfaces should have additional articulation to both provide sufficient architectural detail to create a human scale and to provide shading on the heat gain intensive sides of buildings d clear glazing with low e coatings for heat gain are strongly preferred to reflective surfaces the life of the inside of the building should be visible from the exterior wherever possible e fenestrationlouvers at parking structures where exposed to side streets should be proportioned similar to the rest of the structure and be attractively treated f articulation around windowsopenings should be consistent and proportionate to the building expression as a whole so as to integrate the fenestration into the facade as a whole 2 requirements a windows will be required to be vertical in proportion and curtain wall areas will be required to affect a vertical proportion with the hierarchy of their members b storefronts will require vertical members at no greater than eight 8 feet to zero 0 inch intervals to create sufficient articulation at ground level c mirrored glazing or very dark shading glazing is prohibited along street frontages other than local street frontages within the racrtw and racrte districts d architectural lighting the treatment of architectural lighting is an important visual enhancement to the built environment it also is part of the overall illumination system which relates to safety at night 1 principles a lighting can either be concealed and indirect or can be provided by well designed quality fixtures that create enhancement to the architecture that they are attached to b step lights and bollards at a walking level enhance safety and provide attractive lighting that does not create visual glare c street lighting should be of an attractive and long lasting design that fits well into the overall design context and should have light apertures that focus the lighting on the street and away from buildings so as not to disrupt the residences d minimum light levels must be met from a safety point of view but excessive lighting and energy waste must also be avoided e natural light colors are preferred  high pressure sodium orange lighting is discouraged f ballast noisemaintenance is also an important consideration 2 requirements a all exterior steps and significant grade transitions must have light levels for safety per accepted industry standards b exterior exit ways parking lots and public areas around buildings must have sufficient light levels for safety per accepted industry standards c lighting designs will be reviewed by the town from the standpoint of energy efficiency color quality and aperturespread d high pressure sodium lighting will be limited to service areas and areas with limited public impact only e all outdoor lighting fixtures shall be consistent with the night sky regulations found in section 12262 e architectural materials architectural materials are the visually exposed portions of the built environment the long term quality and integrity of the materials and expression defines in the long term the built environment 1 principles a materials should be natural and authentic wherever possible where there is a high level of human contact with the building notably at the ground level b materials should be long lasting and consistent in their expression with limited maintenance particular attention to durability is essential at the ground level due to high trafficuse c a range of materials and expressions are encouraged in the overall built environment materials such as wood stone stucco metal etc d it is expected that the materials used are consistent with the building expression e in order to create an authentic mixed use environment as a whole emphasis at the ground level is on the time honored materials and building traditions thus further promoting the human scale f simulated materials are acceptable if used in locations where they are not in direct contact with people and have qualities that do not make them stand out as obviously fake g where simulated materials are used eg vinyl siding to simulate wood siding materials with simpler details that look most convincing will be preferred h brick and stone veneers will be judged by both their finishes and the treatment at the corners full corner pieces should be used to conceal thinness of veneer treatment veneers over massed volumes vs single surfaces will also be preferred  1exh a   2409   9710  exh a 12 12512   additional design guidelines a site furnishings site furnishings play an important role in the overall visual quality and identity throughout the rac districts careful consideration must be given to the selection of the site furnishings such as benches trash receptacles drinking fountains bicycle racks etc site furnishings should be accessible and usable by the handicap whenever possible furnishing should be compatible with their surroundings and should maintain unity throughout the rac districts materials for site furnishings should be chosen for maximum strength durability and should require as little maintenance as possible surface finishes should weather and age gracefully accents in the form of hardware etc may require additional maintenance beyond the recommended minimum recommended materials include  cultural andor artistic metals  aluminumcast aluminum  stainless steel  concrete  granite  keystone  specialty hardwoods  cast iron finished with an epoxy based paint capable of resisting the elements of south florida 1 bike racks bike racks will provide a safe and secure place for residents and visitors to lock bicycles and participate in civic activities the placement of bicycle racks will also invite residents and visitors to interact within the district recreationally a variety of bicycle rack designs is encouraged such racks may be architecturally treated as significant items or minimized relative to their visual impact bike racks may be integrated with light standards or with other site elements to reduce their visual impact 2 bollards bollards should be designed and implemented to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing they should be used to discourage vehicular intrusion into a pedestrian area bollard design should relate to adjacent architectural or streetscape elements the design of the bollards should reflect or enhance the theming of the district all bollards should be harmonious with the other site furnishings the incorporation of lighting into the bollard design is encouraged in special applications for emphasis and where vandalism is not considered a problem 3 flagpolesbanners flagpoles and banners present opportunities for the inclusion of color pattern and movement in the district they can be used both as temporary signage and as a seasonal display banners may include many items of various shapes such as windsocks and flags they can be hung from walls light fixtures or any other structural element of sufficient strength 4 seating seating is used for social interaction  people watching waiting and resting seating should occur in heavily used public areas and along main pedestrian corridors benches should be located in shaded areas as well as in open areas where a high volume of people could congregate in locations where longer stays are anticipated benches with backs should be used backless benches should be provided for shorter stays special care should be taken to locate and select benches that discourage overnight sleeping by vagrants special measures should be taken to ensure that the selection of benches will be ones that are comfortable year round and are not affected by the exposure to intense sun it should be noted that seat walls provide other opportunities for seating seat walls could be implemented at grade changes separate spaces and be decorative in nature 5 tree grates tree grates are used to expand the walkable surface of the pedestrian corridor while adding canopy tree shade to the pedestrian environment the tree grates need to have barrier free access for wheelchairs and carriages to carefully travel over them tree grates should be compatible with the character of the surrounding area 6 planters as special site elements planters and flowerpots can visually enhance a space and provide areas for landscape relief as well as reduce or accent an architectural mass planters should be designed very carefully in consideration of the plants to be used pots can be used singly or in a mass to accentuate a space with color and visual interest 7 trash receptacles trash receptacles shall be incorporated within a consistent system of color materials and style they shall compliment other furnishings and help unify the image of the rac university mixeduse district the major consideration when providing trash receptacles is their location receptacles are to be sited only where they will be both accessible and used they should be placed along major pedestrian corridors but shall not impede on pedestrian traffic they should also be located at portals pedestrian nodes intersections and seating areas trash receptacles shall be sited carefully to not obstruct views and to not transmit unpleasant odors trash receptacles must be waterproof and should contain a lid each receptacle shall have a sturdy removable liner for easy maintenance and be sized to accept standard trash bags maintenance vehicles shall have reasonable access on the promenade to the trash receptacles b special features 1 fountains fountains can be utilized as major elements in enhancing the image of the rac districts water in the fountains may be used in a variety of ways the movement of water can create excitement and life in the environment its sound can be used to drown out undesirable noises the design of fountains should take in to consideration the safety of plaza participants especially if the fountain is interactive the type of fountain spray should respond to the amount of wind action plaza area wind regulators should be used to minimize water spray on users and adjacent paving fountains should be designed using state of the art cost efficient equipment and finishes which will require minimal maintenance the color and materials used in and around fountains should be compatible with other streetscape and plaza elements fountains can be used as focal points in major plazas or as entry features table 124389f provides incentive credit for enhanced open space features such as fountains in conjunction with the open space standards of section 1243819 types of open spaces  principles and minimum standards 2 public art art in the urban landscape is perhaps the most intense form of design beyond visual and hopefully spiritual inspiration it reflects the attitude and character of the community towards culture there are several notable programs to bring art into the city beyond individual homes or businesses they include chicago public art program kansas city and broward county art in public places a public fine arts collection is encouraged throughout the newly developed areas the idea of creating a space and featuring areas for public art differentiate this district as a community dedicated to the enjoyment of fine art as mentioned before these types of programs have been established across the country in more that two hundred 200 states counties and municipalities the object of these programs is to present fine art as opposed to contextual art for public places it may include sculpture mosaics frescoes etc its location may be permanent or temporarymobile in the display of fine art in public spaces the area exhibits its ability to appreciate new ways of seeing life its cultural pride and its unique image c public sector signage and graphics 1 intent and purpose signage and graphics will affect the overall character of the rac districts in addition to serving the functional purpose of informing and directing pedestrianvehicular traffic welldesigned signs establish a visual identity for an area to be truly effective all signs must contribute to the cohesiveness of a project with this in mind it is imperative that the design quality of public sector signs be in the highest of quality the visual appearance of public signs will set the standard for private developers to follow before considering the design of public sector signs it is necessary to fully understand who will be needing signs and why the rac districts will be serving a broad spectrum of people ranging from tourists visitors and shoppers to residents some will be walking or riding a bicycle while others driving vehicles public and private sign design must relate to all of these various users in light of the broad range of public users the design of signs and graphics needs to be flexible it is essential that the sign design have the ability to expand and serve new areas within the public sector the development of the rac development district will undoubtedly require several years the graphic design of the signs must be a high quality must be timeless and must tie into the theme of the rac districts design and selection of materials for the sign idea and sign standard must be readily available over a period of several years requests for additional public signs will be made even after the completion of the final project phase signs must be reproducible without undue costs the ease of replacing damaged signs must also be considered the size of signs should vary depending on how they are viewed ie their size should be considerably larger if they are seen from a moving auto as opposed to a pedestrian on foot the introduction of a larger than necessary sign within the context of a pedestrian area can negate its original purpose within pedestrian areas signs which are located at an excessive height will be relatively ineffective many styles of standards can be selected for freestanding public signs each standard has a slightly different visual appearance standards can be complicated or simple the final selection of a standard design should in part be determined by its adaptability to the various types of signs needed in the project 2 applicability a directional to emphasize the character of the rac districts and the cohesiveness of its various components a series of signs directing vehicles and pedestrians throughout the area is recommended since a directional sign usually includes a list of nearby functions and businesses it serves as a directory of what can be found the hierarchy of information on directional signs should be as follows  major public action nodes  major public attractions  major commercial attractions  individual businesses there are two 2 types of directional signs  motor vehicles and pedestrianscyclists in many cases messages for both groups will be combined only in areas where the pedestrians are far removed from vehicular traffic are separate signs necessary b informational this type of signage will provide important information within the rac districts to identify focal areas including but are not limited to  transit stops public plaza entrances and other focal areas informational kiosks should be located near busy site elements and may display a variety of temporary civic local information for the resident or visitor informational signage could also include street identification signs therefore having a consistent street identification standard c regulatory regulatory signage within the rac districts will be used to define emergency access service vehicle areas bicycle only paths handicapped areas etc it is meant to define specific points that are limited to overall use d entrygateway entrygateway statement pertains to vehicular traffic and involves largescale elements their purpose is to designate the point of transition from one 1 area to another which in this case is to designate the rac districts from the outside and to announce major destinations within the districts elements that should be incorporated into the entry statement include  special paving  masses of plant material  focal elements  special lighting  banners  signage  water features d lighting a wellcoordinated lighting system is an effective means of establishing a sense of security and unity throughout the rac districts although the primary function of site lighting is to provide nighttime orientation and security light fixtures become a very visible site element and are essential elements in creating the image of the rac districts therefore careful consideration should be taken not only to technically efficient systems but also to visually acceptable fixtures and standards lighting should only be directed at the selected element over flow of light must not exist all outdoor lighting fixtures shall be consistent with the night sky regulations found in section 12262 1 scale proportion and hierarchy consideration should be taken to the proper relation between the scale of a fixture and the scale of the area in which it will be implemented in general the larger the scale of the use the higher the mounting light the size of the fixture should also be in proportion to the height of its pole to avoid awkward proportions different uses require varying types of lighting this section deals with the different types and scale of fixtures as well as light levels footcandles and light sources acceptable for each anticipated use see section 1243715 for all lighting requirements 2 light levels the following minimum average maintained footcandle levels shall be provided for the rac districts approach roadways 10 fc side streets 08 fc parking fc promenades 10 fc sidewalks 06 fc landscape lighting varies 3 light source several different light sources are available for site lighting with characteristic advantages and disadvantages to each the following general guidelines are included for selection of an appropriate light source a high pressure sodium because of high efficiency and long lamp life highpressure sodium should be the predominant light source throughout the rac districts it should be used on all streets and parking lots because of its somewhat poor color rendition qualities however it should be avoided or supplemented in areas of high pedestrian use b metal hallide although not as efficient as highpressure sodium metal halide is much more pleasant in high pedestrian areas because it illuminates with very true colors it should be considered for larger scale people gathering spaces such as plazas and along people streets c color corrected mercury vapor mercury vapor is also a pleasant light source for pedestrian areas but it is less efficient than metal halide it should be used only in low voltage situations where efficiency is not critical or to accent landscape material because of its ability to emphasize green foliage d incandescent incandescent light while pleasant for people environments is very inefficient and has a short lamp life it should only be used in lowlevel pedestrian scale fixtures where special effects are necessary and where regular maintenance is possible such as building entries small courtyards etc 4 light location streetscape lighting arterial and collector roads wherever possible existing fixtures and poles illuminating the rac districts should be retained repaired and or replaced to maintain the consistency and efficiency of the current street light system as necessary individual poles should be relocated to resolve conflicts with proposed streetscape elements and pedestrian flow where supplemental or future street lights are proposed they shall match the existing fixturespoles all poles shall be located a minimum of four 4 feet to zero 0 inches 40 from the curb face and maintained plumb and secure the placement of poles should not create undesirable obstructions in pedestrian ways light poles in high pedestrian traffic areas can be outfitted for specialty banners 5 local street aka side street lighting wherever possible existing fixtures and concrete poles illuminating side streets should be retained repaired and replaced to maintain consistency with the current street lighting system as necessary individual concrete poles should be relocated to resolve conflicts with proposed streetscape elements and pedestrian flow fixtures along side streets shall be located approximately one hundred 100 feet on centers all poles shall be located a minimum of four 4 feet to zero 0 inches 40 from the curb face and maintained plumb and secure the placement of poles should not create undesirable obstructions in pedestrian ways light poles on designated people streets shall be outfitted for specialty banners 6 parking lot lighting lighting in offstreet parking lots should be designed to allow safe and secure night use of these facilities wherever possible existing poles illuminating parking lots should be retained and repaired with new fixtures added to provide a more efficient and consistent lighting system parking lot lights located interior to larger parking lots shall have a type v square distribution to ensure maximum coverage and to be spaced approximately one hundred and twenty +120 feet on centers parking lot lights located along the perimeter of parking lots shall have a type iii distribution to throw light towards the lot interior and minimize glare on adjacent facilities these fixturepoles shall be spaced one hundred +100 feet on centers lighting within parking areas must be closely coordinated with parking lot design poles should be located out of the way of vehicular and pedestrian circulation aisles and parking stalls they should be located at regular spacing within the landscaped area of center or side islands and protected by curbs or wheel stops 7 pedestrian lighting pedestrian lighting of the rac districts must serve a variety of functions this lighting must establish a safe and secure atmosphere for nighttime use and provide a distinct ambiance which differentiates pedestrian facilities from adjacent vehicular zones the fixtures poles and bollards must have a human scale and offer a visual appearance which complements the other streetscape elements in creating a unique image for the area 8 landscape lighting in many instances appropriate light levels and pleasant accent effects may be achieved use of landscape lighting accent spotlight fixtures directed upwards into tree or palm foliage provide low intensity but oftendramatic illumination of nearby pedestrian areas whereas up lighting provides a more selective result down lighting with fixtures attached to free standing poles or neighboring buildings is advantageous when more tha one 1 tree is to be lit or when a less concentrated effect is desired lighting trees is as much art as it is science for this reason it is impossible to give definitive guidelines regarding the quantity of illumination or exact placement of fixtures however desired effects usually require between onehalf 05 and one 1 ambient footcandles depending on design objectives color of foliage surrounding light levels etc when used landscape accent lights should be unobtrusive in appearance andor hidden from view all landscape lighting should be placed where beams are directed away from pedestrians viewpoint lights mounted directly in trees should be discouraged unless means of attaching the fixture and conduit are sensitively handled to protect the plants health and assure a pleasing appearance 9 materials light fixtures are available in many materials of these materials cast aluminum or cast bronze provides maintenance long life and pleasing aesthetics fixture fittings of cast aluminum fixtures should be stainless steel poles and bollards for lighting should be aluminum fiberglass decorative concrete or cast iron these poles provide a thin profile and require little maintenance depending on location and thematic considerations decorative poles may be chosen light poles in main public areas should aim to enhance the overall theme of the rac districts as a unique cultural hub 10 color and finish during daylight hours lighting fixtures should blend into the landscape and coordinate with other site furnishings the right color and finish of the lighting material will enhance the theme during daylight hours therefore making it a 24hour site detail finish should be bakedon powdered coatings that minimize maintenance  1exh a   2409  exh a 12 12512   green building a intent and purpose this section is an introduction to the elements of leed and green building recommended by the town of davie it is encouraged that the guidelines below are understood prior to submitting for this incentive based section of the regulations for more information please refer to united states green building councils usgbc wwwusgbcorgleed website 1 what is a green building  a sustainable building that emphasizes state of the art strategies for sustainable site development water savings energy efficiency materials selection and indoor environmental quality 2 who ranks the green buildings  united states green building councils usgbc leed ranking system which is a voluntary consensusbased national standard for developing highperformance sustainable buildings 3 how are green building principles used for developing the rac  the town of davie wants to encourage responsible development incentive program that will further enhance the area compatibility and will utilize environmental and sustainable building techniques  the incentives will allow flexibility in development regulations not currently allowable 4 what incentives are offered  flexible height allowances  flexible setback allowances  waving construction fees b green building and site plan benefits 1 economic benefits a reduces operating costs of building or business  tax credits and incentives  reduces energy use electricity use from hvac and lighting as much as seventy five 75 percent  freshwater consumption  wastewater output  solid waste generation  greater

deforestation e improves and increases wildlife or vegetative habitat  recreate or restore habitat on site  selecting products that have been produced sustainable f reduces urban heat island effect reflective or green roofs c green building and site plan components intent these are issues that developers will need to consider in becoming leed certified but are also strongly encouraged to be considered without certification these particular issues are addressed because they highlight the major issues that the town wishes to encourage use of incentives 1 building requirements a all buildings in the rac seeking leed certification will be required to meet the prerequisites listed below incentives will be offered incorporation of green building principals as developed by the united states green building council usgbc florida green building council fgbc & leadership in energy and environmental design leed b green building incentive programseven 7 main prerequisites 1 erosion and sedimentation control 2 fundamental building systems commissioning 3 minimum energy performance 4 cfc chlorofluorocarbons aka freon reduction in hvac & r heating ventilation air conditioning & refrigerant equipment 5 storage and collection of recyclables 6 minimum indoor air quality performance 7 environmental tobacco smoke control c amendments to the fgbc florida green building council and leed requirements will be enforced at the time of site plan review 2 reducing urban heat islands leed sustainable site credit 7 a an urban heat island uhi is a metropolitan area which is significantly warmer than its surroundings as population centers grow in size from village to town to city they tend to have a corresponding increase in average temperature traditional dark nonreflective surfaces for parking lots roofs walkways and other surfaces absorb solar radiation and radiate it back to surrounding areas the environmental protection agency says on hot summer days urban air can be between two 2 and ten 10 degrees fahrenheit 210f 26c hotter than the surrounding countryside this increases local hvac equipment cooling energy consumption this effect can be mitigated use of shading and the use of light colored materials that reflect the solar radiation b to achieve credit for reducing the urban heat island 1 use energy star compliant roofing highly reflective 2 use roofing with high emittance rating 3 install a green roof vegetated for at least fifty 50 percent of the roof area 3 light pollution leed sustainable site credit 8 a light pollution is light that has escaped the area intended for its use and instead lights an area that is better left undisturbed light pollution causes problems in reducing the visual access to the night sky disturbing the nocturnal environments and it causes substantial energy costs over the lifetime of a building that could be avoided the town has the right to override this for any needs of their own wayfinding signage safety security etc b to achieve credit for reducing light pollution 1 eliminate all unshielded fixtures 2 minimize up lighting 3 utilize down lighting 4 employ a lighting professional to assess the projects lighting needs 5 light only areas that require it 4 storm water management a the davie rac is part of a larger water management system called cbwcd central broward water control district many property owners within the rac live on property that is either adjacent to a community lake or one 1 of the districts secondary canals while these lakes and canals can lend a pleasant appearance to neighboring property it is important to remember that first and foremost they exist for the purposes of storm water storage and drainage b the goal of the town of davie is that new development will not disrupt any of the natural water flows but will increase onsite filtration and eliminate contaminants to achieve this objective the town new developments to utilize the benefits of 1 pervious materials as a substitute to concrete and asphalt  pervious paving vs impervious paving leed sustainable site credit 6  pervious materials are able to absorb surface water rather than shedding the water  pervious materials are cooler for the reducing surface heat radiation  pervious materials reduce the need for curbs and gutters as drainage structures 2 aquascaping areas of water runoff  serves to catch trap and filter pollutants within water runoff  aides in controlling erosion of water body banks and filter pollutants within water runoff areas 5 potable water conservation importance of watera community that can conserve water will be a positioned for adapting to the future water efficient landscapes native plantings buildings should employ the use of innovative wastewater technologies such as low flow fixtures and waterless fixtures where possible current codes do not allow for the use of greywater or blackwater systems lower water usage will result in lower water connection fees 6 reduced site disturbance leed sustainable site credit 5 the intent of this regulation is to conserve existing natural areas and restore damaged areas to provide habitat and promote biodiversity the requirements for this regulation involve reducing the development footprint defined as entire building footprint access roads and parking to exceed the local zonings open space requirement for the site by twentyfive 25 percent for areas with no local zoning requirements like the university campuses designate open space area adjacent to the building that is equal to the development footprint 7 alternative energy 8 alternative transportation leed sustainable site credit 4 a critical part of this plans long term success will be determined by how well new developments provide opportunity for people to use alternative modes of transportation proposed bus routes have been proposed in the rac master plan study these routes are encouraged to create a park once philosophy for those visiting the rac we also to encourage pedestrian links to bus routes and bicycle racks to allow persons to utilize as many modes of transportation as possible  1exh a  exh a 12 12512   definitions the

ethics and constitutional law jan 12 2000  and the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota  the town council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses as a category of commercial uses are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including but not limited to personal and property crimes prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on property values urban blight pornographic litter and sexual assault and exploitation 2 sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses and should be separated from other certain uses such as other sexually oriented businesses and establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent a concentration of sexually oriented businesses and such uses 3 each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the town has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating 4 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 5 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 6 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 7 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 8 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 9 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 8 raise substantial governmental concerns 10 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns and each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the town has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating 11 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 12 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 13 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 14 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 15 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this article  definitions the following words terms and phrases when used

prevention device which is operated by atmospheric pressure in combination with the force of gravity the unit is designed to work on a vertical plane only the one moving part consists of a poppet valve which must be carefully sized to slide in a guided chamber and effectively shut off the reverse flow of water when a negative pressure exists backflow the undesirable reversal of flow of nonpotable water or other liquids mixtures or substances under pressure into the water system from any source or sources other than its intended source backflow may take place cross connection and into the piping of a public water system or consumers potable water system there are two types of backflow backpressure and backsiphonage backpressure backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumers potable water system backpressure ie downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure can result from an increase in downstream pressure a reduction in the potable water supply pressure or a combination of both increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps temperature increases in boilers etc reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied such as during water line flushing fire fighting or breaks in water mains backsiphonage backflow caused by a negative pressure ie a vacuum or partial vacuum in a public water system or consumers potable water system the effect is similar to drinking

sewer and communication 4 the debris is determined by the town administrator or designee to be dangerous or hazardous 5 the debris prevents garbage collection thereby creating a public health hazard 6 the debris contains contaminants which have a reasonable likelihood of leeching into the soil andor aquifer 7 the debris has a substantial negative impact in preventing or adversely affecting emergency repairs to buildings andor property 8 the debris presents a reasonable danger of being transported by wind andor water into the surrounding areas of the town and thereby increasing the cost

impacts the towns recovery efforts 11 the debris significantly interferes with drainage or water runoff so as to be a significant hazard in the event of significant rainfall 12 the sheer volume of the debris is such that it is impractical and unreasonable to remove in an orderly and efficient manner absent action by the town 13 the type extent and nature of the debris is such that it would cause much greater damage if the debris was not removed immediately 14 debris removal in commercial or other specific areas will be cleared if in the opinion of the town administrator or designee the
