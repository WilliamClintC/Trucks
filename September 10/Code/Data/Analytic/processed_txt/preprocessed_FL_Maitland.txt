policies adopted in the conservation element of the city of maitlands comprehensive development plan it is the intent of the city of maitland to promote the health safety and welfare of existing and future residents property owners and visitors to the city by establishing minimum standards for the protection of natural plant communities along wetlands and shorelines and the installation and continued maintenance of wetland and waterfront vegetative areas within maitland the regulations in this chapter are created in order to achieve the following 1 improve environmental quality the regulations are designed to improve environmental quality by protecting vegetation in riparian and littoral zones such vegetation greatly benefits the environment by 1 slowing and filtering rainfall runoff thereby trapping and settling out sediments and pollutants and hence improving water quality  2 maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management and aquifer recharge  3 reducing and reversing air noise heat chemical and nutrient pollution  biological capacities of trees and other vegetation  4 providing habitat and cover and hence promoting wildlife conservation  5 binding soil particles and holding soils together against the effects of wind waves and water and hence reducing erosion caused by construction neglect trampling or overuse of shorelines and 6 providing food to microorganisms benthic organisms insects and fish and hence promoting biological productivity 2 promote water conservation the regulations are designed to promote conservation of potable and nonpotable water by encouraging the preservation of existing plant communities encouraging the planting of natural or uncultivated areas and encouraging the use of sitespecific plant materials wellsuited to soil moisture conditions 3 preserve existing vegetation the regulations are designed to preserve existing natural vegetation and incorporate native plants plant communities and ecosystems into landscape 4 removal of invasive species the regulations encourage the control of certain exotic plant species which have become nuisances due to their tendency to damage public and private works negatively affect the public health andor disrupt or destroy native ecosystems 5 human values the regulations provide direct and important physical psychological and economic benefits to human beings by regulating landscaping activities in order to ensure attractive landscapes maintain historic waterfront views break up the monotony and soften the harsher aspect of urban development improve water quality improve fisheries improve recreational opportunities and hence add value to homes and other waterfront property 6 aesthetics forested riparian areas and littoral zone vegetation add to the natural beauty of lakes wetlands and other water bodies as well as provide means for passive recreation such as fishing bird watching and other activities the regulations are designed to improve the aesthetic appearance of residential and nonresidential areas by providing for incorporation of natural and planned open space in ways that will harmonize and enhance the natural and artificial environment 7 improved administration and enforcement the requirements establish procedures and standards for the administration and enforcement of this chapter integrated and consistent

parcels located with the stormwater service area and the cost of measuring or verifying the impervious area for each individual small single family residence greatly exceeds any benefit to be derived from individual measurement or verification 2 the eru value of all small single family residence parcels is on average seventy 70 percent of that of a medium single family residence parcel and accordingly all small single family residence parcels are assigned an eru value of 07 c medium single family parcels the council hereby finds and determines as follows 1 medium single family residence parcels constitute a significant proportion of all parcels located with the stormwater service area and represent the most typical size singlefamily residence within the stormwater service area the

in condominium common area parcels when the allocable share of common area of residential condominium parcels is considered the average impervious area for each condominium unit is found to be within the range of such areas for small single family residence parcels and is assigned an eru value of 07 2 the classification of any new or modified condominium as small single family residential is subject to redetermination by the city manager or designee subject to the right of the condominium association to appeal to the council in the manner provided in subsection 20135e if as a result of such a redetermination the actual impervious area of such new or modified residential condominium prorated among the units of the condominium is found to be more than one hundred 100 percent of an eru 2532 square feet then the condominium units shall be assigned an eru value of 10 effective as of january 1 of the year following such redetermination 3 in determining the mitigation credit factor for residential condominium parcels any part of the impervious area of the condominium that is directly connected to the citys stormwater management system without onsite detention shall be subject to the stormwater utility fee without credit for mitigation f general parcels the eru value of each general parcel shall be determined by 1 dividing the impervious area of the general parcel by one eru 2532 square feet and 2 multiplying the result by the appropriate mitigation credit factor in determining the mitigation credit factor for general parcels any part of the impervious area of the parcel that is directly connected to the citys stormwater management system without onsite detention shall be subject to the stormwater utility fee without credit for mitigation g mitigation credit policy for private stormwater management facilities 1 the council recognizes the benefits provided by privately maintained stormwater management facilities developed parcels which provide private stormwater management facilities should be credited to the extent that such facilities advance the goals and objectives established from time to time in the stormwaterlakes management plan and the citys comprehensive plan the council hereby approves the initial mitigation credit policy attached as appendix a the policy may be modified by resolution of the city council at any time to conform to revisions in such goals and objectives  provided that such modification shall not apply retroactively to credits previously established under a preexisting credit policy 2 in order to receive a

such other reasonable requirements as may be necessary to demonstrate the relief of city stormwater facilities or advancement of the goals and objectives of the stormwaterlakes management plan and the citys comprehensive plan 3 no mitigation credit shall be applied to the stormwater fee for service provided to a developed parcel by a stormwater management facility constructed or maintained with public funds nevertheless a mitigation credit shall be available for stormwater utility service provided to a developed parcel by an approved and permitted regional stormwater management facility if

final determination as to whether a development is of residential scale and character shall be subject to the approval of the appropriate city of maitland board charged with reviewing the application for development a building shapes and form buildings with lengthy unbroken facades should be avoided as a general guide the maximum horizontal length of an unbroken facade plane should be fiftyfeet facade offsets should be incorporated to create shadow lines an essential character of residential scale is a traditional appearance of building walls and openings walls define the overall form of the building while openings give them human scale residential character building components include elements such as decks and balconies and roof configurations which reflect traditional residential features such as pitched hip or gable residential character can also include parapets and a combination of flat and pitched roofs height limitations or design preferences may dictate a flat roof b

building ornamentation  and architectural elements such as doorways archways arches and columns dormers and gables clearly defined entries facing the street should be provided features that visually reduce the height mass and scale of the structure such as clearly defining the base middle and cap of the building address residential scale and character c site organization may be used to establish residential character including clustering of buildings the manner in which buildings are organized on the site and building massing where special attention is made to its massing by the grouping of forms and spaces to reflect more of a human scale creating friendly pedestrian scaled exterior spaces by grouping of smaller structures as well as indenting or setting back some upper floors or portions of upper floors add an element of residential scale buildings should be located so that the front door faces the main street d building materials brick accents of brick stucco stone wood or natural materials are generally more reflective of residential character the scale of materials should be smaller and relate to a more finegrained character reflective of residential architecture ie using brick to create a smaller modular scale instead of large panels and using architectural detailing including trim framing fenestration and articulation is encouraged instead of creating continuous uniform surfaces onsite parking parking should be deemphasized as much as possible if possible parking should not be placed in the front of the building but if so located shall be screened

purpose and intent the function of the downtown maitland special district is to guide future development and redevelopment toward creating an attractive urban pattern that balances the pedestrian and traffic needs of residents and to encourage but not require mixeduse development by generally desiring residential use development to be provided above commercial andor office use while it protects and enhances the original pattern of development consistent with the goals of the citys comprehensive plan downtown master plan and the downtown maitland revitalization plan downtown maitland extends generally from maitland boulevard on the north to the csx railroad overpass on the south and includes three subdistricts referred to as the sawmill packwood and waterhouse districts the packwood district is the focal point of the downtown maitland revitalization area and includes the citys town center and core area the intent of the packwood district is to encourage economic viability by creating a mixture of public and private uses to promote walkability and activation of the retail core of the citys downtown the packwood district represents the heart of the city and is intended for a vigorous mixture of commercial and residential uses that create a magnetic gathering place for citizens it will contain a concentration of commercial civic and cultural uses interspersed with mixed use developments and urban open spaces buildings will be positioned close to the street to encourage pedestrian activity and to create a main street urban pattern design components central to the intent include clustering of buildings buildings with distinctive storefronts balconies and inviting entrances as well as outdoor seating and cafes that interact with the street buildings will have diverse architectural types which incorporate decorative elements and attractive roof elements the sawmill and waterhouse districts serve as the northern and southern entries to downtown maitland and are intended to achieve the vision of a pedestrianoriented mixeduse area the sawmill district represents the north gateway to the city and includes maitlands sunrail station the focus of this district is to create a transit supportive place the area will be based upon transit oriented principles such as a pedestrian and bicycle friendly environment with a compact and functional mix of uses design components central to the intent include a mix of residential employment and supporting retail and service uses high densitiesintensities around the transit station and compact development form grouping of buildings to allow for easy pedestrian access between buildings building architecture will include faade treatments that reduce building scale to include gables covered walks awnings storefront windows and building interaction with the sidewalk system the waterhouse district represents the southern gateway to the city the focus of the district is a safe compact pedestrianfriendly mixed use business district that serves neighborhoods within walking distance design components central to the intent include buildings with distinctive store fronts balconies and entrances that connect with the street buildings with decorative elements and roofs which encourage a variety of street views and diverse architectural styles additional criteria have been established for groundfloor residential development within the packwood sawmill and waterhouse districts to promote economic viability and to achieve a mixture of uses for downtown maitland refer to section 2121 planned development and  the location of groundfloor residential within each district will be evaluated based upon compatibility with surrounding uses the character of the surrounding areas street
