reserved division 5  stormwater utility findings the mayor and council of the city of college park make the following findings a stormwater management is needed throughout the city limits while specific service and system demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within city of college park is consistent with the present and future needs of the community b addressing the stormwater management needs in the city is essential to protecting the public health safety and welfare the provision of stormwater management programs and systems results in both service and benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of city of college park in a variety of ways c failure to effectively manage stormwater runoff can result in flooding stream bank and ditch erosion property damage and degradation of water quality aquatic habitat and biological communities failure to manage these impacts can put the citys ability to receive state and federal grants and permits at risk d the volume and quantity of stormwater generated by a development has been proven to be most closely associated with the amount of impervious surface on the property therefore the square footage of impervious surface is the most appropriate factor for calculating stormwater utility fees e the area of impervious surfaces on each property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services systems and facilities provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and that the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service charge f it is imperative that the proceeds from all service charges for stormwater management services systems and facilities together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services systems and facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes and directs that such proceeds of service charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes g the city of college park presently owns and operates stormwater management systems which have been developed over many years the future usefulness of the existing stormwater systems owned and operated by these entities and of additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the entities to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems in the city in concert with the management of other water resources in the county in order to do so there must be adequate and stable funding for the citys stormwater management programs operating needs and capital h the existence of privately owned and maintained onsite or offsite systems facilities activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the service charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit and that such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the city engineer reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems facilities activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the stormwater contribution from the property benefited by such systems i as a result the citys governing authority finds that a utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering storm water management services and the citys governing authority finds that a utility fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding storm water management services in the city  61807 definitions the following definitions shall apply to this division any

iv  conservation subdivisionopen space development footnotes  2  editors note formerly numbered as art vii and renumbered by  2 of adopted  purpose a to provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure  b to provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land  c to preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater floodplains wetlands streams steep slopes woodlands and wildlife habitat  d to permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure including paved surfaces and utility easements necessary for residential development  e to reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development  f to promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community  g to promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions  h to encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood  i to encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries  j to promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities businesses and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles  k to conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space  and l to preserve important historic and archaeological sites  101606 applicability this conservation subdivision option is available as a use by right in the zoning districts listed and referenced in the most recently adopted zoning

multiple ownership if held in multiple ownership however the site shall be developed according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility  101606 housing density determination the maximum number of lots in the conservation subdivision shall be determined by either of the following two 2 methods at the discretion of the city planner a calculation the maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning in making this calculation the following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel 1 slopes over twentyfive 25 percent of at least five thousand 5000 square feet contiguous area  2 the 100year floodplain  3 bodies of open water over five thousand 5000 square feet contiguous area  4 wetlands that meet the definition of the army corps of engineers pursuant to the clean water act  or 5 anticipated rightofway needs for roads and utilities b yield plan the maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision design plan prepared by the applicant in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible based on a minimum lot size of 6000 square feet the plan is not required to meet formal requirements for a site design plan but the design must be capable of being constructed given site features and all applicable regulations  101606 application requirements a site analysis map required concurrent with the submission of a site concept plan applicant shall prepare and submit a site analysis map

this article or set forth elsewhere in this ordinance when referring to this article are the regulations of the t transportation overlay district b purpose 1 the purpose of the transportation overlay district is to provide for the regulation of vehicle parking facilities which either serve as the primary use of a parcel of property or are unrelated to the primary use of such property these facilities include but are not limited to airport parking and shuttle services car rental agencies and offsite airport related employee parking college parks proximity to the airport as well as access provided by the transportation system make it a prime location for development of such enterprises in addition displacement of past uses of properties adjoining atlanta hartsfield jackson international airport have created large tracts of vacant land near the airport suitable to meet this market demand 2 proliferation of such facilities in an uncontrolled and unplanned manner is not in the best interest of the city of college park such facilities involve vast areas of pavement characterized by three unique features ie a visual sea of cars significant stormwater runoff and introduction of significant vehicle traffic improper location of such facilities results in negative impact on traffic patterns as well as a strong negative visual impact on surrounding development establishment of a transportation overlay district which will accommodate such facilities in a concentrated accessible location is preferred in order to ameliorate the negative effects of such uses accordingly this single purpose district is established to concentrate such facilities in specific locations to buffer such facilities by perimeter landscaping thereby minimizing the visual impact on the traveling public and surrounding development concentration of such facilities further allows economies in the provision of common stormwater detention facilities which might otherwise be constructed on individual sites 3 this district is intended as an overlay district allowing establishment of vehicle parking facilities within the configuration of the allowable tdistrict boundaries

separate offense nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent the department from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation of this appeals of decisions of the mayor and council appeals of decisions of mayor and council under this be by writ of certiorari to the superior court of fulton county  21819 article 8  tree preservation 81  intent it is the expressed intent of these tree protection standards that all site planning and design for development of land be undertaken with a survey of trees on the property and that the grading final placement of buildings structures and roads utilities and other features minimizes the removal of existing trees and insures their aesthetic distribution throughout the development on the property in support and furtherance of its findings and determination that 1 rampant growth and development in the region has resulted in the innumerable loss of trees tree roots hold soil in place and tree photosynthesis converts carbon dioxide to oxygen tree loss thus has contributed to dramatically increased soil erosion and sedimentation high growth areas where natural green spaces are diminishing have left fewer trees to transform into oxygen the carbon dioxide of ever increasing harmful vehicular and industrial emissions resulting in severe air quality degradation  2 integrated forest canopies reduce the costs of maintenance of other colocated parts of the urban infrastructure  3 well managed urban forest resources increase in value and provide benefits to all citizens of the community with respect to air quality water quality stormwater management temperature amelioration community aesthetics and general quality of life  4 these benefits are crucial to the long term health safety and welfare of the citizens of college park  5 the removal of forest canopy from urban areas of the state and its replacement with more intensive land uses exacts real costs upon the infrastructure which must be borne by all citizens of the community  6 community forests function to the benefit of the local citizenry as a part of the public infrastructure as much as streets utilities stormwater management structures and sewers  7 healthy community forests increase local commercial and residential property values  and 8 a tree conservation and landscaping ordinance is one part of a dedicated and integrated planning process dealing with land use impacts of impervious surface urban hydrology and water quality 82  applicability this article shall apply to any and all activity within the city of college park city which requires a landdisturbance permit or soil erosion and sediment control permit exemptions from this  removal of dead diseased or infested trees as determined by the georgia forestry commission proof of a certified arborists determination is required in order to avoid penalties for tree removal 2 the operation and maintenance of orchards and tree nurseries in active commercial operation 3 all property involved in a viable agricultural operation establishment cultivation or harvesting of fields andor livestock operation commercial forestry operations are allowed provided that valid forestry management plans have been submitted to and accepted by the city of college park 4 any lot within a subdivision zoned for single family residential uses where the lot has been purchased from the developer and a house has been built 83  specimen trees a specimen tree is any tree or grouping of trees which has been determined to be of high value because of its species size age location or historic value general criteria for the determination of specimen trees are as follows 1 any deciduous canopy tree whos dbh equals or exceeds twentysix 26 inches 2 any evergreen canopy tree whos dbh equals or exceeds twentytwo 22 inches 3 any understory tree whos dbh equals or exceeds eight 8 inches 4 any dogwood redbud or magnolia tree whos dbh equals or exceeds four 4 inches 5 any tree which has a significant historical value and can be documented records or otherwise 84  protected trees 1 no person shall cut destroy cause to be destroyed or remove any tree of eight 8 inches diameter breast height dbh twentyfiveinch circumference or larger or any dogwood redbud or magnolia tree with a trunk diameter of four 4 inches dbh or larger in preparation for anticipation of or in conjunction with any development activity until such removal has been approved as part of the overall site development approval process of this saving of existing trees less than the protected size is encouraged and may be utilized in some cases to meet the requirements for replacement of trees that are approved for removal 2 deforestation on nonexempt properties is strictly prohibited any person or entity who is responsible for the deforestation of a site shall be subject to the maximum penalties allowed under this any site which includes exempt and nonexempt properties that has been deforested shall not be eligible to apply for a development permit a building permit rezoning or annexation into the city for a period of thirtysix 36 months from the date that the deforestation occurred for purposes of this paragraph the last date of deforestation shall be the last day in which a forestry operation is conducted the property owner who conducts a forestry operation within the city shall be required within thirty 30 days of the last day of deforestation to deliver to the city manager a written notice setting forth the last date of deforestation and the identity and location of the property deforested upon a property owner failing to timely notify the city manager as provided above the engineering director shall establish the last day of deforestation based upon the best information available to himher which estimated date shall not be rebutable for purposes hereof forestry operation shall include but is not limited to the harvesting of forty 40 percent or more of the trees measuring eight 8 inches dbh and larger on any property or development site for purposes of this paragraph the term site shall encompass and include any and all property within the city without regard to any possible exemption 3 the sites of trees that have been identified to be saved on a tree protection plan see below and are subsequently removed must be replaced with an equal number of replacement tdus 85  tree protection plan tpp required a tree protection plan tpp must be submitted to the engineering director chief building inspector upon application for a landdisturbance permit the tpp shall be combined with a preliminary plat construction plans andor site plans whenever possible the tpp must be prepared by one 1 or more of the following professional registered in the state of georgia registered landscape architect urban forester arborist land surveyor or engineer the tpp must include 1 the location of all trees

may be outlined as a group with their size and species listed in a summary table 3 the species location and dbh of all trees proposed to be removed the engineering director may require additional information including but not limited to a certified arborists appraisal of the trees viability and anticipated life span a specimen tree may be removed if it is shown that at least one 1 of the following conditions are met a the location of the tree prevents the opening of necessary traffic lanes b the location of the tree prevents access to the property and that no alternative access exists c the tree is dead diseased or dying to the point that repair or restoration is not practical or the disease may be transmitted to other trees as determined by a certified arborist the city planner or hisher designee or georgia forestry commission d the construction of utility lines necessary for the project cannot be installed via directional boring i the boundaries of all required buffer areas ii the boundaries of all landscaped areas iii the boundaries of all proposed buildings iv the boundaries of all other impervious surfaces v the location depth and height of all utilities 4 upon submission of the tpp to the engineering director a preliminary review will be made by the engineering director or hisher designee the tpp will either be approved denied or returned to the applicant with recommended changes which must be made prior to the issuance of a landdisturbance permit or soil erosion and sediment control permit 86  site design all mf op c1 c2 hc bp li and hi properties must maintain forty 40 percent of the site as green space all dc and do properties must maintain twentyfive 25 percent of the site as green space while all types of trees are protected under these standards special emphasis is placed on preservation of large trees and certain significant and more valued species listed herein the highest site design priority shall be given to preservation of hardwood trees with a dbh of twentysix 26 inches or larger removal of these valued trees is highly discouraged and will only be approved upon the determination of the planning and zoning commission that all responsible design alternatives have been explored by the applicant and removal cannot be avoided the placement of grade changes and building pads shall respect existing significant trees under no circumstance shall a grade change be allowed to intrude upon the crz of a retained tree for development sites that do not contain any or very few of these significant trees design emphasis should be shifted to preserving other species present 87  tree and shrub density requirements 1 property subject to this have as a condition of approval a minimum average tree density of fifty 50 tree density units tdus per acre of disturbed area disturbed area is defined as the entire limits of the site project activity buildings roads parking areas stormwater management systems etc outside of the buffer area existing trees which will be retained will be given credit toward this requirement at the rate of one 1 tdu per caliper inch dbh replacement trees will be given credit toward this requirement using a trunk measurement which is no less than six 6 inches from the ground at rate of one 1 tdu per two 2 inches of trunk diameter replacement trees from twoinch caliper up to threeinch caliper are worth fifty 50 percent of the tdus for an existing tree replacement trees from threeinch caliper to fourinch caliper are equal to the tdus of an existing tree replacement trees fourinch caliper and over are worth one hundred fifty 150 percent of the tdus for an existing tree under no circumstances will the density be less than fifty 50 or greater than one hundred 100 tdus per acre of disturbed area tree density units per disturbed acre are in addition to any natural undisturbed watershed protection buffers or other environmental buffers required for development 2 single family residential lots being developed shall have proportional share of fifty 50 tdus per acre post development or portion thereof with a minimum of one 1 overstory tree per dwelling unit du located adjacent to the rightofway and spaced eighty 80 to one hundred 100 feet apart example one 1 acre lots shall have fifty 50 tdus  half 12 acre lots shall have twentyfive 25 tdus  onequarter 14 acre lots shall have 125 tdus  less than onequarter 14 acre lots shall have tdus at the same proportions as above 88  shrub density requirements 1 property subject to this have as a condition of approval a minimum average shrub density of one hundred 100 sdus per acre all sdus to be planted must be located outside any natural occurring vegetation 2 in order to encourage the protection of trees above and beyond the required 50 tdus shrub density requirements may be reduced by a similar area covered by the crz of the additional trees to be saved 3 as a healthy shrub eventually covers an area with a fivefoot diameter or 196 square feet the required sdus may be reduced by that area equal to 196 square feet or multiples thereof for example should a development save sixty 60 caliper inches of existing tree stock per acre the applicant would receive credit for the additional ten 10 inches this could be calculated as follows a determine the critical root zone crz of the tree to be saved a teninch tree would yield a fifteenfoot wide crz b square the crz two hundred twentyfive 225 square feet c multiply the product of step 2 by 314 p this determines the healthy growing area of the tree to be saved or 7065 square feet d divide the result of step 3 by 196   36 sdus e the number derived in step 4 is the allowable reduction in sdus 89  highway buffer 1 a landscaped highway buffer shall be established parallel to the entire front of the property along roosevelt highway outside of downtown college park on old national highway on godby road and on w fayetteville road the highway buffer is included in the fifty 50 tdu and one hundred 100 sdu per acre requirements 2 for existing lots of record with a total depth from the rightofway lines less than five hundred 500 feet the depth of the highway buffer will be measured at ten 10 percent of the depth of the lot for each fiftyfoot decrease from the five hundredfoot measure landscaping will be required according to the following table per every one hundred 100 feet of lot width depth of lot linear feet buffer depth linear feet tdus required per 100 linear feet sdus required per 100 linear feet area of buffer square feet 500

depth shall apply ie a depth measuring two hundred eightyfive 285 feet would be required to plant additional vegetation 4 if an existing lot measures less than two hundred fifty 250 feet in depth the minimum depth of the highway buffer shall be twentyfive 25 feet 5 this sliding scale provision for the highway buffer does not apply to any lot with a depth greater than five hundred 500 feet which would be required to provide for the fiftyfoot buffer 6 if due to site constraints and location of existing vegetation the number of total required landscaping materials cannot be reasonably placed within the highway buffer the individual plant materials are still required but may be placed elsewhere along the side buffers rear buffer or within the parking medians the planning and zoning commission shall have discretion over the alternate placing of materials 7 the buffer shall contain only vegetative landscaping materials except for the uses listed below a vehicular access drives

planned lines must run parallel to the rightofway an equivalent amount of buffer may be required beyond the fifty 50 feet if the character of the buffer is greatly disturbed to the extent possible such service lines should be consolidated with vehicular access routes g electrical telephone gas water supply sewage disposal and other utilities may be constructed within the required buffer area after installation of such services and to meet the requirements of this section the developer shall be required to restore the buffer area as approved by the city h drainage and stormwater detention areas where existing or created ponds and drainage swales will occupy a substantial portion of the highway buffer because of natural land forms or drainage patters additional buffer depth may be required to achieve the visual softening intent of this section 8 no tree six 6 inches in diameter at four 4 feet dbh diameter breast height or larger may be removed from the highway buffer except for access drives sight triangles and dead or diseased trees as approved by the planning and zoning commission 9 landscaping the purpose of this section is to protect and enhance any existing tree canopy understory trees and shrubbery coverage in order to soften the appearance of structures and parking lots visible from the highway it is also the purpose of this section to screen headlight glare on and off site and to mitigate commercial lighting as seen by neighboring properties and from the highway natural appearing landscape forms are encouraged a the plant materials designated in this be generally distributed along and throughout the buffer in order that there not be significant gaps without plantings except as required at sight triangles and road intersections b no more than one 1 in three 3 overstory trees shall be pine or conebearing c existing as well as installed vegetation may be included in meeting the requirement but if there is not sufficient distribution within the buffer then additional plantings will be required at the discretion of the planning and zoning commission d existing evergreen or deciduous understory trees may be counted for credit to meet the requirements e size caliper and height of trees shrubs or plants shall meet requirements of citys general landscape ordinance f trees and shrubs shall not be pruned in any manner that would significantly diminish the desired softening character of the buffer except in accordance with standard horticultural practice trees shall not be limbedup from the ground more than six 6 feet to the lowest branches except as required within sight triangles at intersections or to provide adequate light for understory plantings 810  other buffer and landscaping standards a perimeter buffers landscaped buffers at least ten 10 feet in width shall be maintained along the side and rear property boundaries these buffers may be penetrated for vehicular and pedestrian passageways linking adjoining properties provided the passageways are placed approximately perpendicular to these buffers b foundation buffers a landscaped buffer at least six 6 feet wide shall be maintained between any structure and any parking or driving area except for loading areas and areas where driveare utilized this space is to be reserved for plant material either existing or planned sidewalks and handicap ramps may be placed adjacent to the buffer on either side the buffer may be penetrated to provide for access to the building c opaque walls and fences any opaque or partially opaque walls or fences installed along the front of the property including those used for screening of parking areas must be softened with landscaping materials d parking lot requirements parking lots shall include landscaped strips and landscaped islands as follows e landscaped strip shrubs andor trees shall be installed in the landscaped strip to provide for semicontinuous planting along the landscaped strip shrubs shall be at least one 1 foot in height at installation and reasonably projected to grow at least two 2 feet in height within three 3 years f landscaped island each landscaped island shall contain one 1 broadleaved overstory tree with a minimum size of two 2 caliper inches at dbh and a minimum height of ten 10 feet 811  tree protection requirements tree protection best management practices bmps will be mandatory to insure the survival of existing trees and stands of trees during and after construction sometimes it is more feasible to save stands of trees than it is to save single trees which are scattered throughout a site a tree protection area shall be maintained around all trees and stands of trees to be retained in most cases this tree protection area is the same as the critical root zone crz in some instances a larger area may have to be designated as a tree protection area as determined by the georgia forestry commission or the engineering director the tree protection area shall be marked with standard tree protection fencing orange as well as with tree protection area signs attached to the tree protection fencing stakes the construction and grading process can cause damages such as direct physical root damage indirect root damage and trunkcrown damage due to this no landdisturbance construction process or storage of equipment or materials will be allowed to take place within the tree protection area and the following will be adhered to 1 all individual trees to be retained must be marked with orange engineering tape tied around the trunk of the tree at a height of five 5 feet above the predevelopment grade 2 the tree protection area crz of individual trees and stands of trees will be marked with standard tree protection fencing orange at least two 2 tree protection area signs two 2 square feet each shall be posted at each individual tree protection area at least four 4 tree protection area signs shall be posted at stand of trees to be protected signs shall not be nailed or affixed to trees but shall be attached to stakes supporting the tree protection fencing 3 no person engaged in the construction of any structures or improvements or any activity shall encroach or place solvents material construction machinery or temporary soil deposits within six 6 feet of the area outside the critical root zone as defined herein or any existing significant tree within a tree save area or buffer zone 4 during subdivision street construction landdisturbance allowed by a development permit shall be limited to areas needed for street rightofway drainage easements and utilities all other areas will be considered tree protection areas if utilities must be routed tree protection area and as a result encroach upon the crz of any tree to be saved the utility must be tunneled by directional bore technique at a minimum depth of twentyfour 24 inches 5 the tree protection area should be maintained in a naturally vegetated state the clearing of invasive nonnative plant materials such as kudzu shall be allowed 6 structures shall not be located closer to a specimen tree than the distance equal to the crz 7 roads and paved areas shall not be located closer to a specimen tree than the distance equal to the crz plus ten 10 feet without consent of the city 8 if irreparable damage has occurred to a tree or trees within a tree protection area as determined by the engineering director or the georgia forestry commission it shall be the responsibility of the developerbuilder to remove and replace tree or trees with an equal number of replacement tdus as the damaged trees and to guarantee survival of the tree or trees after the issuance of the certificate of occupancy 812  tree replacement requirements in some cases tree replacement will be necessary to fulfill the tree density requirement the following are guidelines for tree replacement to be followed after the construction process 1 all trees selected for replacement must be quality specimens free of disease injury or infestation and must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing area and planted in accordance with standards established by the international society of arboriculture 2 all new trees planted to fulfill the tree density requirements must be in place prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 3 new trees planted under the requirements of this do not survive for twentyfour 24 months after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy will be replaced as a condition of occupancy trees shall be bonded via a maintenance agreement bonds will be released after the twentyfourmonth period has passed and the health of the trees has been certified and accepted by the city 4 replacement overstory trees shall not be planted within twenty 20 feet of any structure or within ten 10 feet of any paved area replacement understory trees shall not be planted within ten 10 feet of any structure or within five 5 feet of any paved area 5 landscape islands and peninsulas in nonresidential and institutional parking areas must contain sufficient pervious surface area to accommodate the appropriate replacement tree in order to insure its longevity and shall be irrigated 6 at least seventyfive 75 percent of the replacement trees must be native trees as indicated in the list of suitable replacement trees 7 the minimum diameter for replacement trees shall be two 2 inches as measured six 6 inches above grade 8 vegetation shall be at least five 5 feet from fire hydrants and shall be maintained as such 9 residential lots shall have proportional share of tdus per acre or portion thereof with a minimum of one 1 overstory tree per dwelling unit du located adjacent to the rightofway and spaced eighty 80 to one hundred 100 feet apart 10 in order to prevent a monocrop urban forest which can be prone to disease no more than fifty 50 percent of the replacement trees may be of one 1 species the remaining replacement tree stock must be made up of two 2 additional species 11 where minimum tree density cannot be met due to natural site constraints or redevelopment status and not site design or size of the property the developerbuilder may seek permission from the city manager or designee city planner other to donate to the city of college park landscaping and reforestation fund to compensate for not meeting the requirements of the

the responsibility of the engineering director chief building inspector or hisher designees to conduct a final inspection for compliance with this section before a certificate of occupancy will be granted the engineering director chief building inspector or hisher designees have the authority to revoke suspend or void any landdisturbance permit or soil erosion and sediment control permit stop all work onsite or any portion thereof or withhold a certificate of occupancy when there has been a violation of any of the provisions of this bonding in order to insure the survival of required replacement trees and shrubs said plant materials may at the discretion of the city planner be bonded under the following circumstances 1 seasonal planting bond when the time of year is inappropriate for installation of required plant materials a seasonal planting bond may be utilized for a period of up to six 6 months this bond allows a project to receive a certificate of occupancy once all other requirements have been met the seasonal planting bond shall be equal to one hundred 100 percent of the total cost of materials and installation and will be released upon final inspection and compliance with the approved landscaping plan seasonal planting bonds shall be in the form of cash check money order or letter of credit 2 landscape survival bond all projects that require replacement plant materials shall be required to submit a landscape survival bond which shall be valid for a period of twentyfour 24 months from the date of the certificate of occupancy this bond allows for the replacement of plant materials that fail within the twentyfourmonth period the landscape survival bond shall be equal to one hundred 100 percent of the total cost of materials and installation for the

inspections department shall issue an immediate stopwork order 2 the city planner or hisher designee shall review the damage and determine the resulting effect upon the approved landscape plan the site adjoining properties and the city in general 3 a moratorium may be placed upon the development based upon the severity of the actions the moratorium will last for a period of up to six 6 months at the discretion of the city manager 4 upon request the developer shall submit a revised tree protection and landscaping plan for review and approval by the planning and zoning commission 5 once the moratorium has been lifted the revised tree protection and landscaping plan must be adhered to in order to avoid further penalty 817  appeals any applicant for a landdisturbance permit a soil erosion and sediment control permit or a certificate of occupancy who is aggrieved by any decision of the engineering director or city planner relating to the application of this have the right to appeal the board of zoning appeals as provided under of the city of college park zoning ordinance 818  landscaping and reforestation fund a purpose one 1 of the goals and purposes of the landscaping ordinance is to have each development site offset the impact on the environment of such development by means of providing the required landscaping and pervious surface on the site where such impact occurs where
