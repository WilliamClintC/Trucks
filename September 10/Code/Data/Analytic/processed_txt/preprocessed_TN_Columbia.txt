following factors i whether or not the applicant is subject to a national pretreatment standard containing discharge limitations more stringent than those in  18213 and grant an exception only if such exception may be granted within limitations of applicable federal regulations  ii whether or not the exception would apply to discharge of a substance classified as a toxic substance under regulations promulgated by the environmental protection agency under the provisions of section 307a of the act 33 usc 1317 and then grant an exception only if such exception may be granted with the limitations of applicable federal regulations  iii whether or not the granting of an exception would create conditions that would reduce the effectiveness of the change 7  1848 treatment works taking into consideration the concentration of said pollutant in the treatment works influent and the design capability of the treatment works  iv the cost of pretreatment or other types of control techniques which would be necessary for the user to achieve effluent reduction but prohibitive cost alone shall not be the basis for granting an exception  v the age of equipment and industrial facilities

defined a buffer is a specified land area located parallel to and within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel and extending to the lot or parcel boundary line together with the planting and landscaping required on the land a buffer may also contain or be required to contain a barrier such as a berm fence or wall or combination thereof where such additional screening is necessary to achieve the desired level of buffering between various land use activities a buffer is not intended to be commensurate with the term yard or the term stormwater management area  types of required buffers there are two types of required buffers that may occur on any given development site as follows street buffers  and acommentary generally a street buffer is located along the streets that border a development the buffer requires a modest amount of landscaping enhancing the public environment project boundary buffers bcommentary generally a project boundary buffer is located around the sides and rear of a development this buffer ensures an appropriate transition between uses  location buffers shall be located within the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel parallel to and extending to the alot or parcel boundary line buffers shall not be located on any portion of an existing dedicated or reserved public or private street or rightofway buffers may be constructed in any required yard

minimum 20dfoot wide travelway is maintained clear of vegetation and all clear sight triangles are met trees may be planted in easements for underground utilities with city approval provided the root estructure of the proposed tree is not anticipated to extend more than three feet below the ground shrubs may be planted provided they are only within the outer three feet of the easement where such trees and shrubs are planted the property owner shall be responsible for replacement of such required vegetation if maintenance or other utility requirements require their temporary removal a minimum

design variations are allowed and are calculated on the average depth of the buffer per 100 feet or portion thereof minimum depth of buffer in any case shall not be less than onehalf the required depth of the buffer chosen or less than five feet whichever is greater maximum depth for the purposes of installing required landscaping or receiving credit for existing vegetation shall not be more

additional measurement methodologies related to buffer depth and height are found in 5buffer width averaging  project boundary buffers commentary project boundary buffers ensure a landscaped transition between different types of uses andor zoning districts at first glance the following method may seem complicated in reality this is a fairly easy approach to implement a few simple steps will provide the total amount of plants that are required to be in a buffer as well as the buffer width this approach also addresses the following criticisms that are raised when a city requires buffers and landscaping 1 what about unusual site circumstances the table provides a number of alternative approaches to achieving the requirements 2 why do i have to put all the plants in the lot next to me is vacant this approach anticipates this type of situation the initial developer will have a reduced buffer requirement 3 what if i want to put in a narrower buffer the developer may select alternative 3 canopy and wall this will allow the developer to reduce the buffer width while still providing appropriate screening 4 there are already plants there why do i have to put in new plants credit is given for existing plants that meet a minimum size requirement on a oneforone basis required project boundary buffer table acommentary the requirements for project boundary buffers may create a tree canopy that is too thick to support the accent trees and shrubs below it over time this crowding out of understory is anticipated to occur and has been taken into account in the requirements for these buffers the intent is to achieve an immediate buffering effect based on the smaller species and a longterm effect based on growth of the canopy trees the buffer standards in the table below address the opacity of the buffer that is required on 1the property boundary between zoning districts and in some instances within a zoning district an opacity of 01 screens ten percent of an object and an opacity of 10 would fully screen 2the adjacent development during summer months after five years of growth how to read the buffer table 3 a the required opacity of project boundary buffers is represented in the table below by two numbers for example 35 b the second number represents the total required buffer opacity between any two properties c where the proposed project is located adjacent to vacant property the first number represents the projects required buffer opacity d where the adjacent property is already developed with no buffer the proposed project is responsible for providing the total required opacity the second number e where the adjacent property is already developed with a partial buffer the proposed project is responsible for providing the

columbia 151 arttiiclle 15 sign regulations whereas the specifications set forth in these sign regulations are designed to address aesthetic and traffic safety concerns for the benefit of the public health safety and welfare while allowing the use of signs as a medium for conveying messages  and whereas left unregulated the height sign face area number and location of signs can result in visual clutter confusion for drivers and interference with efforts to establish a desirable community identity  and whereas contextsensitive signage design a publication of the american planning association 2001 encourages the development of good sign regulations for both aesthetic and economic purposes providing as follows successful urban design involves the encouragement of projects that can enhance the physical setting streetscape enhancements including landscaping street furnishings public art and signage can be powerful in establishing a sense of place    taking a holistic approach to all aspects of the built environment results in a place that many people can benefit from in tangible ways when a place feels like it has been cared for people enjoy spending time there and purchasing goods and services by the same token businesses feel comfortable investing in such a location in this sense the issues of urban design in general and sign design in particular are not just aesthetic but economic as well the enhancement of pedestrian environments the creation of attractive gateways and the strengthening of the overall economic vitality and image of the community are all helped by adopting a good set of sign regulations whereas the city of columbia has recently experienced a great deal of development and growth and seeks to manage continued development and growth in an attractive manner  and whereas in establishing parameters for height area number location and other physical attributes of signs the city of columbia has examined the regulations of other cities which have been looked upon as examples of aesthetic quality and has sought input and assistance from area business persons the maury alliance and the sign industry  and conducted public hearings  and whereas visual comparisons of areas where signs have been uncontrolled to those in areas where signs have been controlled show the obvious advantages and aesthetic benefits of good sign regulations  august 2005 zoning city of columbia whereas the city has created a new interstate zoning district and finds it desirable to regulate signage at the newly created zone in a manner separate from the remaining zoning districts in the city so as to provide for larger signs in that zone while still protecting the aesthetics of the city  whereas for the reasons stated heretofore it is desirable to revise the citys sign regulations and reduce the allowable height size and number of signs within the city and to allow for larger signs only in the newly created interstate zoning district in the interest of pursuing aesthetic quality and relative uniformity of signs within the city now therefore be it ordained by the city of columbia as follows sign regulations findings purpose and effect

difficult subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility in that streets must be maintained and various public services must be provided the public health safety and welfare is

accel lane access entrance to or exit from land adjacent to a public road angle of twoway driveway the angle of deflection measured from the centerline of the nearest travel lane to the centerline of the driveway an angle of 90 degrees is desirable auxiliary lane the portion of the roadway adjoining the traveledway for parking speed change turning weaving truck climbing and other purposes supplementary to the traffic movement corner clearance the distance from an intersection of a public or private road to the nearest access along the highway system this distance is measured from the closest edge of pavement of the intersecting road to the closest edge of pavement of the access measured along the traveled way  curb cut an access or driveway providing ingress andor egress to or from the highway system along a curbed section of highway commercial driveway any private entrance exit ramp tunnel bridge side road or other vehicular passageway to any property used for commercial purposes except a farm or dwelling house not exceeding a fourfamily capacity and leading to or from any public road on the highway system deceleration lane a speedchange lane including tapered areas for the purpose of enabling a vehicle that is making an exit turn from a roadway to slow to a safe turning speed after it has left the mainstream of fastermoving traffic also called a decel lane  it denotes a right turn lane or a left turn lane into a development 6 driveway width the width of a driveway shall be measured perpendicular to centerline of the driveway within 5 feet of the rightofway from edge of pavement to edge of pavement or faceofcurb to faceofcurb where curb and gutter are installed directional median opening an opening in a restrictive median which provides for uturn only andor leftturn in movements directional median openings for two opposing left or uturn movements along one segment of road are considered one directional median opening fhwa the federal highway administration intersection an atgrade connection or crossing of a one road with another road island a device used to separate or direct traffic in order to facilitate the safe and orderly movement of vehicles an island may be a raised area that provides a physical barrier to channel traffic movements or a painted area median crossover an opening constructed in the median strip of a divided highway designed to allow traffic movements to cross from one side of the highway to the other in some cases the access management engineer may require the design to be such that some movements are physically prohibited residential driveway any private passageway to any property used for dwelling purposes however if a driveway provides access for more than four dwelling units it shall be considered a commercial driveway restrictive median the portion of a divided highway or divided driveway physically separating vehicular traffic traveling in opposite directions restrictive medians include physical barriers that prohibit movement of traffic across the median such as a concrete barrier a raised concrete curb andor island and a grassed or a depressed median rightofway row all land under the jurisdiction of and whose use is controlled by the city of columbia the tennessee department of transportation or another local government rightofway line a line that defines the limits of the row of a public road as it relates to adjacent property roadway the portion of a highway including shoulders for vehicle use sight distance refers to intersection sight distance which is the distance that can be seen along the main roadway by the driver of a vehicle on the driveway the distance is measured based on an eye 7 height of 35 and an object height of 35 sight distance should be determined to provide adequate time for an entering vehicle to accelerate to within 10 mph of posted speed limit prior to being overtaken by approaching vehicles refer to aashto green book stopping sight distance the sum of two distances the distance traversed by the vehicle from the instant the driver sights an object necessitating a stop to the instant the brakes are applied and the distance required to stop the vehicle from the instant brake application begins stopping sight distance is measured based on an eye height of 35 and an object height of 20 traveled way the portion of the roadway for the movement of vehicles exclusive of shoulders and auxiliary lanes urban conditions this document defines access and spacing criteria separately for urban and rural conditions urban conditions typically refer to roadways that have curb and gutter and sidewalks however urban standards also apply to other roads that may not have curb and gutter that are located within the boundaries of the following character areas from the connect columbia land use plan suburban neighborhood urban neighborhood suburban corridor urban corridor center interstate gateway and employment district state highway system shs the network of highways that have been functionally classified and which are under the jurisdiction of the state of tennessee as defined in state statutes rural conditions this document defines access and spacing criteria separately for urban and rural conditions urban conditions typically refer to roadways that have curb and gutter and sidewalks however urban standards also apply to other roads that may not have curb and gutter that are located within the boundaries of the following character areas from the connect columbia land use plan rural countryside and rural corridor 8 access management access management is a set of techniques to allow for the control of access to highways arterials collectors and other select streets within columbia the result is a more safe and efficient street network for users without access management the transportation network experiences an increase in traffic congestion and accidents throughout the overall transportation network importance of access management with less state and federal monies available for new transportation projects the need for effective transportation systems management strategies is greater than ever before by managing access the city aims to directly increase public safety extend the life of major roadways reduce traffic congestion and improve both the appearance and quality of the built environment without access management the function and character of major transportation corridors can deteriorate rapidly failure to manage access is associated with the following adverse social economic and environmental impacts  an increase in vehicular crashes  more collisions involving pedestrians and cyclists  accelerated reduction in roadway efficiency  unsightly commercial strip development  degradation of scenic landscapes  more cutin residential areas due to overburdened arterials  homes and businesses adversely impacted by a continuous cycle of widening roads  increased commute times fuel consumption and vehicular emissions as numerous driveways and traffic signals intensify congestion and delays along major roads poor access management comes with both direct and indirect costs direct costs include adverse impacts to businesses difficulty of customers entering and exiting businesses safely access to corner businesses may be blocked by queuing traffic customers begin to patronize businesses with safer more convenient access and avoid businesses in areas of poor access design gradually the older developed areas begin to deteriorate due to access and aesthetic problems and investment moves to newer bettermanaged corridors indirect costs include lost time due to increased traffic congestion after access problems have been created they are difficult to solve reconstructing an arterial street is costly and disruptive to the public and abutting homes and businesses the shallow property depth multiple owners and rightofway limitations common to older corridors generally preclude effective redesign of access and site circulation in some cases a new arterial or bypass must be built to replace the functionally obsolescent roadway and the process begins again in a new location access management programs can help stop this cycle of functional 9 obsolescence thereby protecting both public and private investment in major transportation corridors a safety research in the last 50 years has consistently shown that access management increases roadway safety as outlined in the access management manual of the transportation research board trb the reduction of traffic conflict points higher design standards for access points and increased awarenessresponse time for drivers has improved safety on the nations highways and arterials four key observations have come to the forefront 1 increasing the number of access points on a roadway will increase its crash rate 2 roads with medians are safer than undivided roads or roads with twoway left turn lanes twltl 3 it is safer for vehicles to make a uturn and a right turn than to make a direct left turn into or from a driveway 4 medians improve pedestrian safety ten principles of access management most if not all current access management policies are derived from the transportation research boards trb access management manual which was published in 2003 and updated in 2014 trb describes ten 10 principles of access management which were derived from the organizations expertise in transportation they include the following 1 provide a specialized roadway system design and manage roadways according to their primary functions 2 limit direct access to major roadways roadways that serve higher volumes of need more access control to preserve their function 3 promote intersection hierarchy an efficient transportation network provides appropriate transitions from one functional classification to another this results in a series of intersection types that range from the junction of two freeways or a freeway and a major arterial to a driveway connecting to a local street 4 locate signals to favor through movements long uniform spacing of intersections on major roadways enhances the ability to coordinate signals and to ensure continuous movement of traffic at the desired speed 5 preserve the functional area of intersections and interchanges the functional area of an intersection or interchange is the area that is critical to its safe and efficient operation access connections too close to these intersections or interchange ramps can cause serious traffic conflicts 6 limit the number of conflict points a less complex driving environment is accomplished by limiting the number and type of conflicts between vehicles vehicles and pedestrians and vehicles and bicyclists figure 1 7 separate conflict areas separating conflict areas helps to simplify the driving task and contributes to improved traffic operations and safety 8 remove turning vehicles from through traffic lanes turning lanes reduce the severity and duration of conflicts between turning vehicles and improves the safety and efficiency of intersections 9 use nontraversable medians to manage left turn movements nontraversable 10 medians and other techniques that minimize left turns are effective in improving roadway safety and efficiency figure 2 10 provide a supporting street and circulation system wellplanned communities provide a supporting network of local and collector streets to accommodate development as well as unified property access and circulation systems interconnected street and circulation systems support alternative modes of transportation and provide alternative routes for bicyclists pedestrians and drivers figure 1 typical points of conflict intersection source trb access management manual figure 2 illustration of directional median opening for left turn and uturn source trb access management manual these principles have been adopted and implemented by various states including the tennessee department of transportation tdot they have also been employed by numerous local jurisdictions within middle tennessee that face growth pressures including metro nashville franklin murfreesboro and mt juliet these principles provide the foundation for the strategies recommended in this ordinance 11 roadway functional class roadway facilities are each classified according to the amount of access and mobility they provide or how the roadway functions according to the federal highway administration fhwa functional classification is the process by which streets and highways are grouped into classes or systems according to the character of service they are intended to provide as land access increases traffic movement decreases on the lower classified roadways and vice versa  as land access decreases traffic movement increases along the higher classified roads the functional classification of existing facilities is significant because it specifies the desired amount of access control or locations where vehicles can enter or leave a roadway when there is no access control intersecting roads or driveways may connect to the mainline at any point typically local roads have no access control with partial control of access there is minimum spacing of access locations with full control of access connections are only allowed at major crossroads  such as interchanges along an interstate full or partial control of access helps reduce traffic conflicts the diagram below shows schematically how various street classifications relate to each other in terms of movement and access as land access increases traffic movement decreases on the lower classified roadways and vice versa  as land access decreases traffic movement increases along the higher classified roads figure 3 roadway functional class concept 12 a connect columbia transportation plan the citys transportation plan adopted date classifies the five major functional systems which is adopted as the framework for this ordinance as follows interstate and freeway classification interstates and freeways are limited access divided highways with grade separated junctions and without traffic lights or stop signs providing drivers with mobility is the highest priority on this type of facility with access provided only at interchanges spaced at least 12 miles apart interstate and freeway roadways in columbia  interstate 65  us 43 new lawrenceburg highway principal arterial classification the principal arterial system serves major centers of activity the highest traffic volume corridors and the longest trip destinations prior to the interstate system these roads functioned as the primary routes for longdistance travel and therefore emphasize mobility rather than access they still carry a substantial percentage of trips entering and leaving the urban area including thrumovements these roads link to the interstates and freeways in 201 congress passed federal legislation which also made all principal arterials part of the national highway system principal arterial roadways in columbia  us 31 nashville highwaynorth garden

collector classification the collector street system provides both access to land and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods commercial and industrial areas unlike arterial roads it is common for collector roads to pass neighborhoods to collect traffic from local neighborhood streets and channel it into the arterial system in the central business district and other areas of similar development and traffic density the collector system may include a street grid used for traffic circulation collector roadways in columbia  iron bridge road  mapleash road  mooresville pike  cayce

above local streets primary function is to provide direct access to properties and they are not intended for high speeds or heavy traffic volumes this segment of the classification contain all roads not otherwise named above or in the city major thoroughfare plan map as indicated in figure 4 a functional roadway system facilitates a progressive transition in the flow of traffic from the provision of access to the provision of movement interstate or freeways and arterial facilities primarily provide the function of moving vehicles while collector and local streets concentrate more on providing access to individual properties homes and businesses figure 4 roadway functional class system 14 access management regulations the following access management strategies will be utilized for roadways within the city of columbia tennessee driveways a general provisions i it shall be unlawful for any person to cut break or remove any curb along a street except as herein authorized ii this section

planning commission the city council andor city staff may cite noncompliance with the regulations herein as grounds for deferral or denial of any relative application b location of driveway access i application of the driveway access location and design policy requires identification of the functional classification of the street on which access is requested and then applying the appropriate spacing requirements streets are classified as follows 15 1 freeway  2 arterial  3 collector  and 4 local street ii freeway arterial and collector streets in columbia are indicated on the major

wherever feasible along the frontage andor between parking areas and the building site shall incorporate the following 1 a continuous service drive or cross access corridor extending the entire length of each block served to provide for driveway separation consistent with this access management ordinance 2 a design speed of 10 mph and sufficient width to accommodate twoway travel aisles designed to accommodate automobiles service vehicles and loading vehicles  3 stubouts and other design features to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide crossaccess via a service drive  4 a unified access and circulation system plan that includes coordinated or shared parking areas is encouraged wherever feasible 22 iii the development services department may reduce required separation distance of access points where they prove impractical provided all of the following requirements are met 1 joint access driveways and cross access easements are provided wherever feasible in accordance with this section 2 the site plan incorporates a unified access and circulation system in accordance with this section 3 the property owner enters into a written agreement with the city and records the agreement with the deed this agreement should at a minimum indicate that any preexisting non conforming driveway connections on the site will be closed and eliminated after construction of each side of the joint use driveway the development services department shall have leeway in directing the language of any agreement to fit the specific conditions of the site iv the development services department may modify or waive the requirements of this section where the characteristics or layout of abutting properties would make development of a unified or shared access and circulation system impractical v pursuant to this section property owners shall 1 record an easement with the deed allowing cross access to and from other properties served by the joint use driveways and cross access or service drive 2 record an agreement with the deed that remaining access rights along the thoroughfare will be dedicated to the city and preexisting nonconforming driveways will be closed and eliminated after construction of the jointuse driveway 3 record a joint maintenance agreement with the deed defining maintenance responsibilities of property owners medians a nontraversable medians with left turn lanes one of the most effective measures to improve safety on a roadway is to install a nontraversable median raised or grassy medians in the center of a road separate opposing lanes of traffic and restrict turning and crossing movements b continuous twoway leftturn lane twltl i a continuous twltl provides the most alternatives for vehicles to cross a median this roadway treatment provides accessibility when there are numerous curb cuts on an existing corridor 23 ii a twltl in the center of a roadway is safer than having no turning lane but is not as safe as a nontraversable median with directional openings engineering judgement should be taken to select the most appropriate option for any road segment iii in general a twltl functions well for roadways with moderate traffic volumes up to about 25000 vehicles per day and have many commercial driveways and a high percentage of turning movements they can also work well where there are multiple driveways but a low percentage of turning volumes like a major collector or minor arterial traversing a residential area vi twltls are less effective in highvolume situations more than 25000 vehicles per day and much more so in an area with commercial driveways too close together driveway spacing and density still need to be wellmanaged the center turn lane is also not recommended where there are more than two travel lanes in either direction v along transit corridors with twltl medians pedestrian median refuge islands would need to be added at transit stop locations to allow safer pedestrian crossings locations where a transit stop is located within 300 feet of a signalized intersection and safe pedestrian crossing accommodations are already provided at the intersection could be exempt from this requirement when opposing transit stops are located more than 300 feet from each other two separate pedestrian median refuge islands would be required c spacing of median crossovers i when the applicant is requesting a median crossover on a divided arterial highway with a nontraversable median the spacing standards shown in table 3 apply 24 table 3 spacing of median crossovers source transportation research board trb access manual ii other factors will also be considered such as distance to other median openings adjacent land use expected traffic volumes and the resulting volume of uturns that are likely to occur without the median opening meeting the spacing criteria is not in itself an indication that median openings will be allowed d median opening criteria i new median openings or turn bays shall be allowed to provide access to a city street or to provide access to a private development only where the opening or turn bay can be constructed to satisfy the design standards set forth in this article 1 in no case shall median openings be located within the taper or storage area for another median opening or intersection ii where a new median opening is proposed for construction a turn bay shall also be constructed unless the opening is designed to physically prohibit left turns from the divided roadway iii if a roadway project is pending or under construction at the time of approval of a request for a median opening or turn bay the approved median opening or turn note rural or urban condition refers to the functional classification of a roadway not whether that roadway lies within anurbanized area or rural area urbanized small urban and rural area boundaries indicate only population as designated bythe bureau of the census functional class refers to the group or system of the roadway according to the character of service it isintended to provide for mobility speed limit connectivity and access 25 bay shall be constructed to the standards for the approved or completed roadway  however in no case shall construction standards be less than standards set forth above and the person requesting the change shall pay any and all costs required to make the improvement the person or party requesting the median opening or turn bay if approved shall pay to the city the estimated costs associated with design and installation of the median opening prior to the construction of same if the estimate is insufficient to cover said costs the requesting party shall pay to the city any additional sums if the estimated costs exceed the actual cost the overage shall be paid on completion of the project to the requesting person or party vi if the requesting person or entity is to construct the median opening or turn bay the procedures and requirements for construction and public dedication of median openings and turn bays shall be as provided for in this ordinance v construction and materials shall be in accordance with the latest revisions of the tdot standard specifications for road and bridge construction e median openings across turn lanes i due to the danger of queues building up across a median opening turning lanes must also be avoided in median openings ii driveways shall not be located where it is necessary for left turning vehicles to cross an intersections leftturn lane or rightturn lane this problem is often exacerbated as queues build prompting wellmeaning good samaritans to allow the left turner only to crash with a vehicle moving freely in the separate rightturn lane figure 9 avoid median openings across left and right turn lanes 26 turn lanes a deceleration lanes i left turnright turn deceleration lanes may be required as determined by the city engineer at driveway accesses and designed in accordance with tdot and city of columbia regulations b rightturnacceleration lanes i rightturn  acceleration lanes shall be a minimum of 50 feet in length with an additional 100 foot long taper the length may be required to be increased by the city engineer if supported by a traffic impact study tis 1 rightturn  acceleration lanes are generally not provided on low speed highways acceleration lanes may be required at locations where grade sight distance or traffic is such that the development services department determines they are needed 2 a rightturn  acceleration lane and taper may be required at an access point under any one of the following conditions a a high traffic volume on the highway and lack of gaps in traffic make use of an acceleration lane necessary for vehicles to enter and merge with the highway traffic flow b the access location haswill have a high percentage of trucks using it c site specific conditions create the necessity for an acceleration lane for public safety or traffic operations as determined by a tis or by the city engineer 1 when operating speeds on the highway are 55 mph and above fullwidth acceleration lanes of sufficient length should be considered 2 on all driveways where a deceleration lane is provided a tapered acceleration lane should be considered the layout details of the acceleration lane taper are shown in figure 10 ii a rightturn acceleration lane and taper may also be required at signalized intersections if a free rightturn lane is needed to maintain an appropriate level of service iii the taper length will be included within the required acceleration length 27 figure 10 acceleration lane taper details b dual left turn lanes i dual left turn lanes are often needed to satisfy high volume demands capacity analysis shall be used to identify the need for dual left turn lanes ii dual left turn lanes are typically considered when the peak hour left turn volume is 300 vehicles or greater iii the decision to use dual left turn lanes should consider the offpeak periods as well as the peak periods the offpeak periods may be adversely affected since the use of dual left turn lanes typically precludes permissive left turns if dual left turn lanes are included in the design vi the decision to use dual left turn lanes should also consider pedestrian activity in the area pedestrians will have greater difficulty crossing an intersection with dual left turn lanes due to the increased width 28 corner clearance a general provisions i corner clearance for driveway access shall meet or exceed the minimum driveway spacing requirements for that roadway as showing in table 2 driveway spacing requirements 1 for streets classified as principal arterials the corner clearance shall be 440 feet for urban and suburban areas and shall be 660 feet for rural areas 2 for streets classified as minor arterials the corner clearance shall be at least 330 feet for urban areas and 440 feet for rural areas 3 for streets classified as collector roads the corner clearance shall meet the minimum requirements of 220 feet for urban areas and 330 feet for rural areas 4 local streets shall comply with table 2 depending on the land use ii all corner lots shall be of adequate size to provide reacquired corner clearance on street frontage and front yard setbacks iii when minimum spacing requirements cannot be met due to lack of frontage and all means to acquire shared access drives or cross access easements have been exhausted the following requirements shall apply 1 intersections of arterials with channelized rightturn lanes and yield control shall require a corner clearance distance for the first downstream driveway iv if the applicant for a driveway permit determines that a driveway could be appropriately located closer to an intersection than the corner clearance dictates the applicant shall submit a traffic study that using acceptable engineering standards concludes it is acceptable to place the driveway closer to the intersection 29 figure 11 corner clearance v no driveway approach may be located closer to the corner than the as shown in table 3 according to the distance listed in table 3 adapted from the 2015 manual for constructing driveway entrances on state highways table 3 corner clearance requirements classification of street to be accessed by driveway classification of intersecting street principal & minor arterials collectors local principal & minor arterials 200 feet  150 feet  100 feet  collectors 150 feet  100 feet  50 feet  local 125 feet  50 feet  50 feet  note functional classification are based on the city of columbias adopted transportation plan vi this measurement shall be taken from the edge of pavement to the centerline of the driveway when these requirements cannot be met due to lack of frontage the driveway may be located such that the radius will begin at the farthest property line dimensions shall be per table 3 street corner clearance 30 traffic signals a spacing i closely spaced or irregularly spaced traffic signals on arterial roadways result in frequent stops unnecessary delay increased fuel consumption excessive vehicular emissions and high crash rates ii planning ahead for long and uniform signal spacing enhances the ability to coordinate signals and to ensure continuous movement of traffic at the desired speed failure to carefully locate access connections or median openings that later become signalized can cause substantial increases in arterial travel times in addition poor signal placement may lead to delays that cannot be overcome by computerized signal timing systems iii optimal spacing depends on travel speed and cycle length research data indicate that as speed and cycle length increase so does desired spacing iv spacing between signalized intersections shall have a minimum separation as illustrated in table 4 table 4 spacing of signalized intersections v under certain conditions better operation may result from the introduction of signals with less spacing if the alternative forces high volumes of traffic to an adjacent intersection when the applicant can show traffic impact study that better operations can be achieved with less spacing an exception will be considered signal spacing shall be determined based upon corridor 31 performance rather than individual access requests vi effects of signal spacing 1 spacing of signals has a direct effect on roadway efficiency a 12mile signal spacing could reduce vehiclehours of delay by over 60% and vehiclehours of travel by over 50% compared with signals at 14mi intervals with full median openings between signals b a fourlane divided arterial having signals at uniform 12mi signal spacing could carry the same volume of traffic as a sixlane divided roadway with a 14mi signal spacing c each traffic signal per mile added to a roadway reduces speed 2 to 3 mph table 5 indicates percentage increases in travel times that can be expected as signal density increases using two traffic signals per mile as a base table 5 percentage increase in travel times as signalized density increases 2 the number of crashes and crash rates increases as the frequency of traffic signals increases vii signal spacing cycle length and progression 1 a uniform signal spacing of 12 mi provides for efficient signal progression at speeds of 35 mph to 45 mph along major suburban arterials at these speeds maximum flow rates are achieved and fuel consumption and emissions are kept to a minimum viii deviation from the adopted signal spacing interval 1 in many developed areas signal spacing has already been established by 32 the locations of intersecting streets in addition obtaining long uniform signalized intersection spacing is often difficult in practice when a there are severe natural or topographical constraints  b land ownership patterns were laid out by metes and bounds  and c the street pattern is irregular or the area is highly urban with short blocks 2 when a signalized intersection deviates from the selected uniform interval progression can be maintained by increasing the percentage of cycle length devoted to the major arterialwith a comparable decrease in green time for the intersecting street with short cycle lengths ie 60 s each 1% deviation in intersection spacing requires an increase in green time for the major street of 1% of the cycle length to maintain progression and a 1% decrease in green time for the minor street 3 for long cycles 120 s the green time to the major street and red time to the minor street would need to be increased by 2% of the cycle length for each 1% deviation this is a critical issue when considering arterialtoarterial spacing 4 desired progression efficiency for different roadway a as progression efficiency decreases fuel consumption delay at signalized intersections and vehicular emissions increase because of the volumes they carry and the intense traffic demand during peak periods a high level of progression efficiency is desirable on major urban arterials b lower levels of efficiency are acceptable on roadways of lesser importance and lower classification because of the lower volumes shorter trips served and driver expectancy therefore the magnitude of the deviation from an adopted or ideal uniform signal spacing interval may increase as the roadway functional classification decreases c conditions and criteria to be addressed in the evaluation of a potential signal location include the following i combinations of speed cycle length and minimum progression efficiency for both the peak and offpeak periods  ii computer software to be used  iii traffic volumes  iv development conditions  v length of roadway segment to be evaluated  and vi other relevant factors d alternatively the state code or local ordinance may specify minimum progression efficiency criteria for different functional classes of roadways and provide that the conditions combinations of speed and cycle length volumes length of roadway segment acceptable computer software and so forth will be specified for each individual case 33 b traffic signal timing i in all cases signal timing shall be coordinated to facilitate traffic flow for undeveloped sections of a corridor twomile spacing should be considered ii for frontage or service roads preference in traffic signal timing and operation shall be given to highways and crossstreets of a higher access category or function frontage roads a frontage road concepts i an effective treatment to consolidate the number of access points and therefore conflict points on an arterial highway can be achieved construction of a frontage road or a reverse frontage road these concepts are depicted in figure 15 ii a frontage road is a local street oneway or twoway that serves multiple land uses properties and provides one to two points of access onto the main roadway frontage roads are advantageous in commercial and retail environmental along arterials iii frontage roads have a place in serving commercial development as well as residential access needs when carefully designed to facilitate access and maintain signal operations frontage roads can be a viable access management technique for large commercial developments b guidelines for frontage and service roads i frontage roads have been observed to function successfully when they serve low density trip generation activities such as residential and small office areas ii frontage roads for retrofit situations should operate one way and should enter and leave the main lanes as merging and diverging maneuvers iii experience has shown that when a large separation is provided between the intersection of the major road and the crossroad and the intersection of the crossroad and the frontage road the minimum separation is suitable only where frontage road volumes will be very low iv on a twoway frontage road a separation of at least 300 feet  preferably more is necessary for efficient and safe operation and that the absolute minimum is 150 feet  v a minimum buffer width of 25 feet shall be required vi the reverse frontage design figures 13 and 14 results in a separation that allows the intersection of the frontage road and the crossroad to operate with little or 34 no adverse effect on the intersection of the major road with the crossroad figure 12 frontage roads concept figure 13 frontage roads in residential or light office areas can work well where they are one way and begin and end between major crossroads 35 figure 14 minimum separation between a frontage road and the major roadway vii pedestrian and bicycle traffic can be accommodated along the frontage road viii parking on the frontage road may be permitted in residential areas  all measurements shown in this figure are from edge of pavement 36 permitting and appeals general provisions projects applications or requests that require planning commission
