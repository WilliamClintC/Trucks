regulate sexually oriented adult entertainment establishment businesses referred to in this chapter as adultoriented establishments  to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city  to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city  to aid in the alleviation and prevention of the adverse and deleterious effects of criminal activity and disruption of the public peace associated with such establishments  to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the serious health hazards associated with unsafe and unsanitary conditions known to exist in such establishments  and to alleviate the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and other contagious diseases in such establishments b based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the city presented in hearings and in reports made available to the common council and findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1986  young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976  and barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1991  and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the common council finds 1 sexually oriented establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of such establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented establishments such as adult theaters and cabarets engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such establishments 6 at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented establishments including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b nona nonb amebiasis salmonella and shigella infections 7 since 1981 to the present time there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states 8 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen 9 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level 10 the surgeon general of the united states in hisher report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 11 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 12 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of such facilities to selfregulate such activities and maintain such facilities 13 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented establishments where persons view adultoriented films 14 the findings noted in subsections b1 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 15 sexually oriented establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect such substantial governmental concerns 16 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of such reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of sexually oriented establishments further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators of such establishments to ensure that the sexually oriented establishment is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented establishment and is fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring in such establishment 17 prohibiting booths private rooms and cubicles advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 18 requiring licensees of sexually oriented establishments to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 19 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented establishment where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 20 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 21 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexuallyrelated crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in such conduct in contravention of this chapter 22 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 23

suitability no land shall be subdivided for residential commercial or industrial use which is held unsuitable for such use by the common council upon the recommendation of the planning commission for reason of flooding inadequate drainage adverse soil or rock formation unfavorable topography or any other feature likely to be harmful to the health safety or welfare of the future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community the common council in applying the provisions of this section shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which it bases its conclusion that the land is not suitable for residential use and afford the subdivider an opportunity to present evidence regarding such unsuitability if heshe so desires thereafter the common council upon the recommendation of the planning commission may affirm modify or withdraw its determination of unsuitability b existing flora the subdivider shall make every effort to protect and retain all existing trees shrubbery vines and grasses not actually lying in public roadways drainageways building foundation sites private driveways soil absorption waste disposal areas paths and trails such trees are to be protected and preserved during construction in accordance with sound conservation practices possibly including the preservation of trees by well islands or retaining walls whenever abutting grades are altered pursuant to a landscaping plan filed by the subdivider prior    condominium developments a purpose 1 the common council finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of this title to condominium developments the state legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium 2 the factor that makes this title applicable to a condominium development is the creation of multiple distinct property entities at or near the ground surface subject to property taxation as separate parcels with each property entity having different ownership and management the city determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar both physically and in ownership from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership management and control 3 thus the common council finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which are characterized by division of land into lots these impacts include a additional population density  b possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the lands characteristics  c additional demands upon city area parks recreation areas utility facilities and schools  d additional traffic and street use b portions of title applicable to condominium developments the following sections shall apply to condominium developments 1 to land suitability and construction practices  2 relating to preliminary plat approval this stage of approval shall be the only approval required for a condominium development the technical requirements for preliminary plats set forth in not apply since condominiums have separate technical standards set forth in wis stats ch 703  3 relating to fees for review  4 relating to required improvements  5 relating to design standards for improvements  6 relating to dedication requirements c exceptions this section shall not apply to the following condominiums 1 any condominium plat recorded prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this title is derived  2 any conversion of a structure or structures in existence on the effective
