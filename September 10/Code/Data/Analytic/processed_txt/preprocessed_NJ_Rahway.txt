packaging requirements adopted 1291996 by   2176 findings and purpose the municipal council finds and declares as follows a solid waste management within the city of rahway is a fundamental concern of the municipal council due to the limited landfill space available rising costs of waste disposal and impacts on the environment b evidence available to the municipal council indicates that discarded packaging especially takeout food service packaging constitutes the single greatest category of waste within the waste stream of the city of rahway the single greatest source of litter within the city of rahway and is therefore a necessary focus of any effort to reduce the amount of solid waste as well as reducing the economic and environmental cost of waste management for the citizens of the city of rahway c single use nonrecyclable nondegradable packaging and plastic containers are considered to be a fundamental cause of problems associated with municipal waste disposal and litter d chemical composition and ability of a substance to degrade are meaningful and useful criteria to focus upon when establishing a public policy that is intended to improve the management and disposal of solid waste reduce the cumulative impact of litter encourage composting and other forms of recycling minimize the potential for toxic substances which form if solid waste is burned reduce the volume of ash byproducts that may be created by the burning of waste plastic packaging and otherwise anticipate environmental problems that may be caused by municipal solid waste disposal programs e the economic and environmental problems associated with nondegradable substances mixed with degradable substances in the waste stream are so severe that a program to modify the composition of the solid waste in the waste stream thereby reducing the environmental hazards and toxicity associated with solid waste incineration and encouraging the composting of putrescible biodegradable wastes and encouraging other forms of recycling of solid waste substances is hereby determined to be the policy of the city of rahway f that certain retail food establishments within the city of rahway are the points of origin for a significant volume of packaging waste and therefore are particularly susceptible to actions which have significant potential for modifying the composition of this portion of the city of rahways solid waste stream thereby improving solid waste management within this city  2176 drunkdrivingfree school zones  2176  g the widespread use of plastics especially polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride pose a threat to the environment by posing unnecessary taking of landfill space andor when incinerated by the possible introduction of toxic byproducts into the atmosphere h the waste stream within the city of rahway is so large and diverse that any program to establish policies and laws conductive to any waste management program in lieu of landfilling must identify and set new policy for those specific sources of waste packaging which originate in this city i the use of polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride for food packaging is problematical because neither of these plastics are readily recyclable  that their abundant commercial use in lieu of other plastics such as polyethylene or polypropylene unnecessarily complicates the chemical composition of the municipal waste and subtracts from the possible emergence of viable plastic recycling programs  and if burnt together polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride leave a relatively heavier and therefore more expensive ash residue to dispose of and evidence indicates that the burning of these products creates dioxin hydrochloric acid andor other toxic chemicals that could be admitted into the general environment of the city of rahway if incinerated j there are readily available plastic andor paper product substitutes for most of the polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride retail food packaging now being used in the city of rahway the use of which alternatives would be environmentally and economically advantageous to the citizens of the city of rahway k nondegradable plastic bags in the waste stream constitute an impediment to the development of an efficient waste separation recycling or other waste management program and are less desirable than paper bags because these plastic bags are neither recyclable nor compostable l the plastic bags used by retail establishments selling food constitutes a large source of the plastic bags in the waste stream m it is in the interest of the health safety and welfare of all of the citizens of the city of rahway who live work or do business in the city that the amount of nonrecyclable nondegradable packaging be reduced and that the amount of litter on the public streets parks and open spaces be reduced n therefore the purpose of this article is to the maximum extent practical to eliminate the use of nondegradable packaging originating at retail food establishments in the city of rahway in order to protect the air land and waters of the city of rahway from environmental contamination and degradation  2176 rahway code  2177   2177 definitions as

as follows  2132 findings of fact  2133 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed a the flood hazard areas of the city of rahway are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored causes damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business interruptions  e to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  f to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  g to insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  and  2131 yard waste collection  2133   2134 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for h to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions a restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  b requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c controlling the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel flood waters  d controlling filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and e preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas  2133 rahway code  2134  article ii
