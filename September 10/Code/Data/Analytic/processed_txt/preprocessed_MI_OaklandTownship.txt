ordinances article ix general provisions  25067 purpose  intent  findings a it is the purpose of this to carry out the provisions of the land division act public act no 288 of 1967 mcla   et seq by providing regulations governing the division of land and by providing regulations governing the use of parcels and tracts created by land division b it is the further purpose of this to provide regulations designed to minimize confusion among purchasers and potential purchasers of parcels and tracts of land created by the process of division and to promote the orderly development of the township c it is the intent of this to recognize that the land division act as effective upon adoption of this 1 authorizes the creation of parcels and tracts of record that may not be used as building sites or independent sites for residential use andor other uses 2 authorizes the creation of parcels and tracts of record that are landlocked and the creation of parcels and tracts which do not have adequate vehicular access as the township has as a matter of policy consistently required in order to ensure access by police fire and other emergency vehicles 3 provides incentive for the creation of new parcels intended to be building sites having driveways entering directly upon heavily traveled thoroughfares rather than promoting new building sites which do not create new driveways onto thoroughfares as implicitly found to be preferable under mcla  3a 4 requires a municipality to review and approve divisions based upon applications which do not require more than approximate dimensions of parcels and thus precludes meaningful determinations on the compliance of proposed parcels with applicable law and ordinance 5 does not permit a municipality to specify conditions applicable to a division of land which may be needed in order to protect the longand shortterm interest of the public health safety and general welfare including without limitation conditions designed for the preservation of important natural resources  the avoidance of drainage erosion and other problems resulting therefrom  assurance that the establishment of divisions does not create other  25067 general provisions  25067   25068 definitions the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed in this section and terms not expressly mentioned shall have meanings as provided by dictionary and common usage taking into consideration the context in which they appear and the rules applicable to the interpretation of legislation accessible  in reference to a parcel that the parcel meets one or both of the following requirements dangers or health and safety hazards due to steeply sloping topography  avoidance of parcels without adequate water and sanitary sewage disposal and the like  assurance that there will be adequate distances between improvements on parcels and adjoining rightsofway adjoining buildings and other adjoining uses  and the assurance that consumers in the market place are not financially harmed in connection with the purchase of parcels which may not be usable 6 appears to promote the preservation of open space and farmland however such appearance is illusory in actual practice thus creating confusion and unfounded expectations d thus it is found that there are provisions and authorizations in the land division act with regard to the creation of divisions that may result in confusion and otherwise permit actions or results the township board believes should be minimized in the interest of the public health safety and general welfare some of the potentially adverse actions and results have been identified in correspondence of governor john engler to the michigan legislature e it is the further intent of this to recognize the relative advantageous procedures contained in laws and ordinances applicable to plats and condominiums which contemplate more thorough review the creation of more reliable and usable endproducts for use by consumers and which do not have such potential for the creation of confusion and dispute specifically it is the intent of this to promote the creation of new parcels of land by way of the creation of subdivisions and condominiums which the township board finds and determines to be in the best interest of the present and future citizens and property owners in the township and in the best interest of clear understandable and orderly development and use of land f it is found by the township board that minimizing the creation of new parcels of property prior to the employment of subdivision and condominium regulations while concurrently recognizing that there are circumstances in which properties simply are not well adapted to subdivision or condominium application will serve to promote the public health safety and general welfare  25067 oakland code  25068  applicant  the person having the fee interest in the property which is the subject matter of the application under this or the

authorizing communication facilities needed to operate wireless communication systems however it is the further purpose and intent of the township to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of neighborhoods and the character property values and aesthetic quality of the community at large in fashioning and administering the provisions of this section attempt has been made to balance these potentially competing interests recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate wireless communication services and coverage it is the further purpose and intent of this section to a facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for wireless communication facilities b establish predetermined districts or zones of the number shape and in the location considered best for the establishment of wireless communication facilities subject to applicable standards and conditions c recognize that operation of a wireless communication system may require the establishment of facilities in locations not within the predetermined districts or zones in such cases it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse impact upon neighborhoods and areas within the township consequently more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review approval and use of such facilities d ensure that wireless

taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this section j the township board finds that the presence of numerous tower andor pole structures particularly if located within residential areas would decrease the attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the community this in turn may have an adverse impact upon property values therefore it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous tower andor pole structures having low architectural and other aesthetic appeal to most persons recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance and promotion of property values and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public health safety and welfare 1641602

wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures within the community and encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facility purposes consistent with the statement of purpose and intent set forth in l each licensed provider of a wireless communication facility must by law be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives promulgated by the united states congress however particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless communication facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of 199 it is the policy of the township that all users should colocate on attached wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section as stated above and as stated in  if a provider fails or refuses to permit colocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it where colocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be compelled in direct violation of and in direct contradiction to the basic policy intent and purpose of the township the provisions of this subsection are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with the policy of the township b feasibility of colocation district standards charter township of oakland iv36 zoning location shall be deemed to be feasible for purposes of this section where all of the following are met 1 the wireless communication provider entity under consideration for colocation will undertake to pay market rent or other market compensation for colocation for purposes of this standard and the demonstration required under c1 market rent or other market compensation means an amount andor form of compensation or consideration that represents the amount that knowledgeable persons acting in good faith after reasonable negotiations would agree upon 2 the site on which colocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility is able to provide structural support 3 the colocation being considered is technologically reasonable eg the colocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustments in relation to the structure antennas and the like 4 the height of the structure necessary for colocation will not be increased beyond a point deemed to be permissible by the township taking into consideration the intent and purpose of this section and the several standards contained in 06 c requirements for colocation 1 a special land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless communication facility shall not be granted unless and until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible colocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs in determining whether an applicant has undertaken to pay market rent or other market compensation for colocation consideration shall be given to whether the applicants claim is supported by the opinion award determination or recommendation of a qualified fully informed and disinterested third person such as an arbitrator or mediator with a rebuttable presumption that absent such support the applicant has not undertaken to pay market rent or other market compensation for colocation 2 all new and modified wireless communication facilities shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate colocation 3 the policy of the township is for colocation thus if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure so as to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible colocation such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect 4 if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to permit a feasible colocation and this requires the construction andor use of a new wireless communication support structure the party failing or refusing to permit a feasible colocation shall be deemed to be in direct violation and contradiction of the policy intent and purpose of the township and consequently such party shall take responsibility for the violation and shall be prohibited from receiving approval for a new wireless communication support structure within the township for a period of five district standards charter township of oakland iv37 zoning from the date of the failure or refusal to permit the colocation such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which in this context shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services d incentive review of an application for colocation and review of an application for a permit for use of a facility permitted under shall be expedited by
