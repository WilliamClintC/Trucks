this chapter provides for a relatively new concept of development control known as planned development these provisions are provided in recognition of the fact that standard zoning and subdivision controls are appropriate for the regulation of land development within established areas of the city but that such rigid controls can in some instances frustrate imaginative development in certain newly developing or redeveloping areas particularly for medium and largescale developments when planned development techniques are deemed appropriate rezoning of lands to a planned development district by council the set of use and dimensional specifications contained within the respective conventional zoning districts are herein replaced by an approval process in which an approved plan becomes the basis for both initial and continuing land use control these planned developments which modify the traditional forms of zoning permit a developer to secure advantages which can be passed on to the general public by virtue of more desirable and more economical development these provisions provide a controlled degree of flexibility in the placement of structures lot sizes and types of uses while maintaining adequate planning and development standards an important advantage of such provisions is that design flexibility the potentials of the site can be utilized more efficiently and

prostitution potential spread of disease lewdness public indecency obscenity illicit drug use and drug trafficking negative impacts on surrounding properties urban blight litter and sexual assault and

oriented businesses to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area 3each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing andor abating this substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects which is the
