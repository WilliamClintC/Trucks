stringent requirements may be imposed by the county and city or the applicant may present arguments to relax the requirements based on specific characteristics of the site 1buffer area a minimum distance of 1000 feet should be maintained between an existing residence and a rock sand or gravel operation except in those instances when the operator secures a waiver from the affected landowner 2hours of operation amonday 00 am to  pm saturday  am to  noon operations should not be conducted on legal holidays activities such as office or maintenance operations which produce no noise offsite should not be restricted by the hours of operation bblasting should be scheduled on weekdays at  noon there should be no blasting on legal holidays area residents should be notified of the date and time of each blast 3visual considerations aearth berms and vegetation should be employed to minimize visual impacts and reduce the effects of noise bthe need for and placement of berms should be determined by the orientation and position of the excavation site with respect to residences and roadways berms should be located in a way as to restrict the publics view of the property consideration should be given to placing the berms as close to the public point of view as practical generally berms should be six feet in height and seeded immediately after construction to avoid soil erosion berms should be maintained and kept reasonably free of weeds cthe operator should work with the county conservation district and county planning director to develop a planting program consideration should be given to planting one or more of the following evergreen russian olive ash caragana crab apple lilac and buffalo berry the plants should be properly cared for to ensure the highest survival rate and all dead plants replaced during the current planting season as a minimum the program should include trees of varying maturity the planting program should be reduced to writing and kept on file in the county planning department dat a minimum berms should be constructed prior to blasting or the extraction of rock sand or gravel 4blasting ground vibration and over pressure air blast should be monitored for each blast and not exceed guidelines established by the united states bureau of mines 5noise athe noise level produced from rock sand and gravel operations should not exceed an average of 55 decibels recorded over a tenminute period measured at the nearest existing residence to the extraction operation boffsite activities which contribute to background noise levels should be taken into consideration when monitoring an operation cblasting should not be recorded as part of the noise level 6air quality aair quality monitoring should be conducted at the operators expense when conditions warrant  bambient air quality total suspended particulate matter150 micrograms per cubic meter of air as a 24hour average not to be exceeded more than once per year and 60 micrograms per cubic meter of air as an arithmetic mean  pm10 ten micrometers or less in size consistent with the regulations of the state  cemploy techniques that minimize the release of particulate matter created by material stockpiles vehicular movement and process operations  and ddust control agents should be applied to township gravel roads designated as haul routes and all driving surfaces within the extraction area 7hydrology dewatering and drainage aexisting wells should be monitored at the operators expense to document changes in hydrologic conditions around extraction sites bdewatering of the extraction site should not result in downstream flooding cberms should not interrupt the natural drainage of the area unless the diversion is part of an approved drainage control system 8haul roads ain order to minimize the negative impact of truck traffic on area residents extraction operations should be located on or near existing hard surfaced roads consideration should be given to the number of residents located along gravel surfaced roads intended for use as haul roads  bidentify repair and maintenance responsibilities haul road agreement  and cconsider the potential impact on county highways to be used as haul routes 9operator surety aa surety performance bond may be required in an amount to be determined by the planning commissions to assure that sufficient funds will be

agreement with the township concerning repair of designated haul roads and if necessary decontamination of affected ground and surface waters bin lieu of the required surety the operator may deposit cash with the county in the amount equal to the required surety 10reclamation athe type and extent of reclamation should be based on the type of material extracted on the intended postmining land use but in all cases the reclamation procedures should result in the rehabilitation of affected land soil stabilization revegetation and other appropriate means so as to create the least amount of unsightliness and most appropriate future use of the reclaimed area bodies of water may be incorporated into an acceptable reclamation plan  bprovide maps including cross sections showing the existing natural topography and anticipated topographic conditions upon completion of reclamation  cgrading should achieve a contour that is most beneficial to the proposed future land use all berms should be removed where sand and gravel operations were conducted in most cases involving quarry operations the berms should remain in place unless their removal would serve a more useful purpose  dtopsoil should remain on site and be used during reclamation  ea seeding and revegetation plan should be developed for the affected area in consultation with the county conservation district  and fall required reclamation activities should be completed and a compliance inspection performed by the county planning director prior to the release of the surety 11additional considerations athe maximum height of a bench in a quarry should be 30 feet bthe property should be secured during nonworking hours by means of gates and fencing the property should continue to be secured until all required

given to placing the berms as close to the public point of view as practical generally berms should be six feet in height and seeded immediately after construction to avoid soil erosion berms should be maintained and kept reasonably free of weeds cthe operator should work with the county conservation district and county planning director to develop a planting program consideration should be given to planting one or more of the following evergreen russian olive ash caragana crab apple lilac and buffalo berry the plants should be properly cared for to ensure the highest survival rate and all dead plants replaced during the current planting season as a minimum the program should include trees of varying maturity the planting program should be reduced to writing and kept on file in the county planning department dat a minimum berms should be constructed prior to blasting or the extraction of rock sand or gravel 4blasting ground vibration and over pressure air blast should be monitored for each blast and not exceed guidelines established by the us bureau of mines 5noise athe noise level produced from rock sand and gravel operations should not exceed an average of 55 decibels recorded over a tenminute period measured at the nearest existing residence to the extraction operation boffsite activities which contribute to background noise levels should be taken into consideration when monitoring an operation blasting should not be recorded as part of the noise level 6air quality aair quality monitoring should be conducted at the operators expense when conditions warrant bambient air quality total suspended particulate matter150 micrograms per cubic meter of air as a 24hour average not to be exceeded more than once per year and 60 micrograms per cubic meter of air as an arithmetic mean  pm10 ten micrometers or less in size consistent with the regulations of the state cemploy techniques that minimize the release of particulate matter created by material stockpiles vehicular movement and process operations ddust control agents should be applied to township gravel roads designated as haul routes and all driving surfaces within the extraction area 7hydrology dewatering and drainage aexisting wells should be monitored at the operators expense to document changes in hydrologic conditions around extraction sites bdewatering of the extraction site should not result in downstream flooding cberms should not interrupt the natural drainage of the area unless the diversion is part of an approved drainage control system 8haul roads ain order to minimize the negative impact of truck traffic on area residents extraction operations should be located on or near existing hard surfaced roads consideration should be given to the number of residents located along gravel surfaced roads intended for use as haul roads bidentify repair and maintenance responsibilities haul road agreement cconsider the potential impact on county highways to be used as haul routes 9operator surety aa surety performance bond may be required in an amount to be determined by the planning commissions to assure that sufficient funds will be available to protect the county and city in the event the operator abandons a site without completing the conditions imposed by the conditional use permit including reclamation fulfillment of the agreement with the township concerning repair of designated haul roads and if necessary decontamination of affected ground and surface waters bin lieu of the required surety the operator may deposit cash with the county in the amount equal to the required surety 10reclamation athe type and extent of reclamation should be based on the type of material extracted on the intended postmining land use but in all cases the reclamation procedures should result in the rehabilitation of affected land soil stabilization revegetation and other appropriate means so as to create the least amount of unsightliness and most appropriate future use of the reclaimed area bodies of water may be incorporated into an acceptable reclamation plan bprovide maps including cross sections showing the existing natural topography and anticipated topographic conditions upon completion of reclamation cgrading should achieve a contour that is most beneficial to the proposed future land use all berms should be removed where sand and gravel operations were conducted in most cases involving quarry operations the berms should remain in place unless their removal would serve a more useful purpose dtopsoil should remain onsite and be used during reclamation ea seeding and revegetation plan should be developed for the affected area in consultation with the county conservation district fall required reclamation activities should be completed and a compliance inspection performed by the county planning director prior to the release of the surety 11additional considerations athe maximum height of a bench in a quarry should be 30 feet bthe property should be secured during nonworking hours by means of gates and fencing the property should continue to be secured until all required reclamation activities have been completed 1992
