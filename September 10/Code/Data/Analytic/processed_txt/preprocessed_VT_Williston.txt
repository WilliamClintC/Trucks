substantial change in the approved final plans for a development voids its vested rights minor changes may be allowed with the approval of the administrator as provided at wdb 56 23 specific authority the provisions of wdb 24 25 and 26 are specifically authorized by 24 vsa  44127 which requires all bylaws to define how nonconformities will addressed including standards for nonconforming uses nonconforming structures and nonconforming lots these provisions are also consistent with 24 vsa  44122 which limits municipal regulation of existing small lots 24 nonconforming is a nonconforming lot per 24 vsa  4303 13 nonconforming lots or parcels do not conform to the present bylaws covering dimensional requirements but were in conformance with all applicable laws ordinances and regulations prior to the enactment of the present bylaws including a lot or parcel improperly authorized as a result of error by the administrative officer usually a lot is nonconforming because it is too small to accommodate any use that is permitted in its zoning district also be nonconforming for other reasons including the lack of legal or safe access  must nonconforming lots be merged contiguous nonconforming lots that are under the same ownership are considered merged except as provided below 1 exception to merger contiguous nonconforming lots may be conveyed in their preexisting nonconforming configuration where on the effective date of this bylaw each lot  was connected to central water and sewer systems or developed with a water supply and wastewater disposal system that is functioning in an acceptable manner as verified in the field by a licensed designer or  had an allocation for a dwelling unit approved under any of the previous versions of the growth management system that is embodied in of this bylaw 2 easements required the instruments of conveyance for contiguous nonconforming lots that are not merged must create easements sufficient for the replacement and maintenance of water and wastewater systems on all lots involved what does it mean to merge lots merged for the purposes of this bylaw only they may still appear as separate in the land records or be subject to separate property tax bills merger means only that the lots are treated as one for the purposes of determining compliance with the standards of this bylaw adopted by the selectboard

added to adjoining lots using the boundary adjustment procedure established by of this bylaw 2 development a nonconforming lot may be developed for any of the uses permitted in the zoning district in which it is located provided that the proposed development complies with all other requirements of this bylaw if full compliance is not possible a variance may be approved using the nonconformity as a basis for the findings required by wdb  25 nonconforming uses  what is a nonconforming use per 24 vsa  430315 a nonconforming use is a use of land that does not conform to the present bylaws but did conform to all applicable laws ordinances and regulations prior to the enactment of the present bylaws including a use improperly authorized as a result of error by the administrative officer  can nonconforming uses continue yes but only with the limitations described in wdb  and   can a nonconforming use be changed no any change in use or in the nature or extent of use is subject to the requirements of this bylaw  what happens if a nonconforming use ceases to operate if a nonconforming use ceases operation for more than one year twelve months it may be replaced only with a conforming use 26 nonconforming structures  what is a nonconforming structure per 24 vsa  430314 a nonconforming structure is a structure or part of a structure that does not conform to the present bylaws but was in conformance with all applicable laws ordinances and regulations prior to the enactment of the present bylaws including a structure improperly authorized as a result of error by the administrative officer  can a nonconforming structure continue yes nonconforming structures can continue indefinitely in their present form unless they are determined to be dangerous buildings in accord with wdb 182 routine maintenance and repair of nonconforming structures is permitted  can a nonconforming structure be replaced yes with some limitations a nonconforming structure may be replaced with a new one as long as there is no change in the nature or extent of any nonconforming use if present and the degree of the structures nonconformity is not increased a nonconforming structure that is demolished or destroyed may only be replaced if a permit to replace the nonconforming structure is obtained no later than one year 12 months from the date when the nonconforming structure was destroyed  can a nonconforming structure be modified yes with some limitations a nonconforming structure may be modified or expanded as long as there is no change in the nature or extent of any nonconforming use if present and the degree of the structures nonconformity is not adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2  | 4 increased wdb 4 contains specific restrictions on the expansion of nonconforming structures in the lake iroquois shoreline protection area lispa is allowing the replacement or enlargement of a nonconforming structure good policy first remember that a conforming use can be housed in a nonconforming structure this means that the replacement or enlargement of a nonconforming structure may not result in a change in the nature or extent of a nonconforming use second refusing to allow the replacement of nonconforming structures often results in blight as these structures are not maintained allowing replacement may result in an improvement finally most nonconforming structures are not nonconforming in every dimension consider a building that is too close to a stream or a property line the side nearest the stream or property line is nonconforming but as long as that side doesnt change it may be possible to expand the building in another direction in full compliance with this bylaw this possibility gives the owner an asset instead of a building there is little incentive to maintain 27 nonconforming signs see wdb 259 28 correction of nonconformities the drb may require that nonconformities be corrected as a condition of approval of a discretionary permit for additional development on the same lot or on adjacent lots in the same ownership this power is limited to requiring work that is reasonably proportional to the scale of the proposed development 29 additional regulations for nonconformities  what if a nonconforming lot use or structure is in a watershed protection buffer 1 within sfhas as provided by wdb 28l6 and the requirements of the national flood insurance program nonconformities located in watershed protection buffers that are also special flood hazard areas may not be maintained repaired replaced or enlarged unless it has been demonstrated hydraulic analyses conducted in accordance with standard engineering practices and certified by a registered professional engineer that the proposed work will result in no increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood 2 outside sfhas nonconformities located in watershed protection buffers that are not also special flood hazards areas may be maintained repaired replaced and enlarged provided that the degree of nonconformity is not increased and that all exterior work is subject to the runoff and erosion control requirements of of this bylaw but no change that permits or expands the processing manufacture storage or handling of regulated hazardous materials or materials that could float and be dispersed downstream during a flood may be permitted  what if a nonconforming lot use or structure is in the village zoning district all exterior changes in the village zoning district must comply with the

parking loading facilities traffic noise lighting landscaping and screening of these developments however the statute then states that the town may not interfere with the intended functional use in order to clarify the local application of this language the town adopts the policy stated in wdb 8 8 policy on the regulation of partially exempted developments the town strongly discourages partially exempted development on sites that are not zoned for the proposed use in compliance with the statute cited above however the town will accept an application for a discretionary permit for a partially exempted development in any zoning district the drb will then apply all standards of this bylaw to the proposed development and impose any conditions it finds necessary to maximize compliance the

procedures for discretionary permits 61 overview  what are the steps in the discretionary permit procedure the principal steps in the review of a development for which a discretionary permit is required are  preapplication   for residential subdivisions only growth management review   submission of an application including a filing conference   public hearing notice   the public hearing   drb action   submission of final plans   final plan review  and  obtaining an administrative permits to authorize work minor exceptions to some of these steps are explained below remember that approval of a discretionary permit and final plan does not authorize development activity it authorizes the applicant to obtain an administrative permit or permits  what if i have questions before applying for a permit the towns staff can explain the requirements of this bylaw staff can also discuss proposed developments and make suggestions prior to the filing of an application staff cannot design your project or provide drawings if you need that type of assistance retain a qualified professional please make an appointment people who drop in to willistons planning department are often disappointed to find that the entire staff has other commitments making an appointment guarantees that a staff person can spend time with you 62 preapplication  when is preapplication review required preapplication review is required for all subdivisions and all other new development for which a discretionary permit is required by of this bylaw except for subdivisions that create no new development potential and changes in existing developments including accessory structures additions and remodels of multifamily adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified p a g e 6  | 2 commercial institutional and industrial properties for these developments an application for a discretionary permit may simply be filed as provided by wdb 64 applicants are however strongly encouraged to review plans with the administrator before filing an application  what is the purpose of preapplication review the purpose of preapplication review is to acquaint the drb and its advisors with a proposed development site and its possibilities without requiring the presentation of extensive surveying engineering or design data at this step in the review process plans for complex projects should be presented in an informal way that invites comment and the discussion of alternatives  how do i schedule a preapplication review preapplication review shall be scheduled by filing the appropriate form provided by the administrator and all additional information required by the preapplication checklist payment of a preapplication fee will also be required upon determining that it is complete the administrator will place the preapplication on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled drb meeting at which time will allow its consideration  will my neighbors be notified about the preapplication yes notice will be provided to adjoining property owners and the general public in the same way as required for a hearing on an application for a discretionary permit see wdb   how will my preapplication be reviewed preapplications will be referred to the conservation commission andor haac as relevant before they are reviewed by the drb the administrator may also provide comments  will site visits be required yes the administrator and members of the conservation commission haac and drb often need to visit the site of a proposed development the filing of a preapplication constitutes permission for a site visit at any time during regular business hours or as otherwise arranged with the applicant applicants must provide notice of hazardous conditions on a site and arrange a safe site visit at the administrators request  i only want to develop a portion of my land why does the preapplication checklist require me to cover it all town planning tries to ensure that the decisions individuals make in their own interest are consistent with the communitys interests as expressed in the town plan this means looking at how development proposals implement goals like connectivity and watershed health the requirement that concept plans present a proposed pattern of development for the entire contiguous holdings of the owner is necessary if the town is to do this well the pre application checklist allows the level of detail presented in a concept plan to vary and requires little more than a bubble diagram for areas that the applicant does not intend to include in the application for a discretionary permit actual development may proceed in phases as provided in wdb  and   what type of action is taken on a preapplication a preapplication is a basis for discussion it is neither approved nor rejected and creates no vested rights the drb will adopt written recommendations that should be reflected in the application for a discretionary permit the drb may also require that certain information be included in the application for a discretionary permit including 1  the wetlands delineation andor functional assessment that may be required by wdb   adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified p a g e 6  | 3 2  the shared parking study that may be required by wdb   andor 3  a traffic study where it is determined that existing studies do not provide sufficient information see wdb 138 4 other determinations preapplication review is also the time at which the drb may  exempt proposed infill developments in the rzd from open space development requirements  andor  authorize the transfer of development rights in a discretionary permit application  the drb may also recommend that the applicant prepare a specific plan before an application for a discretionary permit is filed  how will i be notified of the action taken on my preapplication the drbs recommendations will be sent to the applicant and other interested parties by

application of this bylaw when certain findings can be made it also explains how this bylaw can be amended 81 variances  is it possible to obtain a variance from the requirements of this bylaw yes but not easily a variance may be granted only where the drb can make the findings required by wdb  or if applicable wdb   how would i apply for a variance an application for a variance is treated as an application for a discretionary permit it will be combined with such an application where the variance would permit development for which a discretionary permit is required where only an administrative permit would ordinarily be required a development for which a variance is needed will be treated as if a discretionary permit was required  what findings are required for the drb to approve a variance the drb must as required by 24 vsa 4469 make the following findings 1 there are unique physical circumstances or conditions including irregularity narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that unnecessary hardship is due to these conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this bylaw in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located 2 because of these physical circumstances or conditions there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this bylaw and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property the bottom line on variances if the property has been or can be developed for a conforming use the town cannot allow a variance see wdb  for a narrow exception to this rule for renewable energy resource structures 3  the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant or hisher predecessors in interest 4  the variance if authorized will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property reduce access to renewable energy resources or be detrimental to the public welfare and 5  the variance if authorized will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and will represent the least deviation possible from the bylaw and the town plan 6 for nonconformities a variance may be approved to permit the reasonable use of a nonconforming lot but only in the limited situations that are made possible by wdb 1 and 2 adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 8  | 2  isnt it easier to obtain a variance for renewable energy resource structures a little as provided by 24 vsa  4469b a variance for a proposed renewable energy resource structure may be approved where the drb finds that it is unusually difficult or unduly expensive for the applicant to build a suitable renewable energy resource structure in conformance with this bylaw and can also make the findings of wdb 3 2 amendments this section is based on 24 vsa  4441 which provides the statutory requirements for bylaw

creative evolution of development in williston consistent with the vision and objectives of the town plan and as specifically called for by  of that plan to do this it sets up a procedure by which landowners work cooperatively with the planning commission and public to draft and propose amendments to the town plan and this bylaw 91 purpose  definition  authority  what is the purpose of the specific plan option the 20162024 town plan called for the use of the specific plan as a tool that replaces the pudprd provisions of the bylaws as they then existed the availability of this tool will encourage and permit the creative redesign and redevelopment of commercial areas the specific plan option may also be used in other areas where it would help realize the objectives of the town plan the two principal advantages of the specific plan option are explained below 1 a specific commitment conventional zoning makes it impossible for a community to change zoning for a specific use that provides substantial public benefits without the risk that the desirable use will not materialize and the zoning change will permit less desirable ones a specific plan remedies this by providing detailed performance standards for development in the area it includes its adoption permits only the specific types of changes proposed by the applicants if the specific changes proposed by the applicants are not made the standards will continue to apply until changed by another specific plan or an amendment proposed by the planning commission and adopted as provided in of this bylaw 2 but not spot zoning the specific plan avoids claims of spot zoning because it is not a deal between a community and an individual landowner a specific plan must go same process required for adoption of the town plan and bylaws this ensures that while it will as all land use changes do serve private interests it will also provide substantial public benefits the specific plan process cannot begin without a finding by the planning commission that substantial public benefits could result  what is a specific plan a specific plan is a set of amendments to the towns comprehensive plan and this bylaw that has been developed by one or more landowners working with the planning commission and the public at the landowners expense the contents of a specific plan will vary with the type and complexity of the development or redevelopment it would permit see wdb   is the specific plan option permitted by vermont law yes because a specific plan is a set of amendments to the town plan and bylaws it is adopted using the procedures set forth in 24 vsa  43844385 for the amendment of plans and 24 vsa  44414442 for the amendment of bylaws as well as the additional procedures established here adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 9  | 2  could a specific plan also be a master plan as permitted by vermonts growth centers law possibly 24 vsa  2793ci5 provides for master plan applications to district environmental commissions 92 use of the specific plan option  when is use of the specific plan option permitted the specific plan option may be used only where the planning commission determines that a substantial benefit to the town could result  what is a substantial benefit a substantial benefit is an action or actions to be taken by the applicants at their expense which implements the town towns comprehensive plan by 1 open space conserving one or more open space assets identified in the towns comprehensive plan or another open space asset acceptable to the conservation and planning commissions open space assets potential open space acquisitions are identified in open space & working landscapes 2 housing providing a substantial number of perpetually affordable entrylevel or employee housing units as called for by the towns comprehensive plan affordable housing the need for more affordable housing is addressed in of the 20162024 town plan see 52  housing opportunities 3 infrastructure providing a major infrastructure asset the need for which is identified in the towns comprehensive plan major infrastructure assets major infrastructure assets that could be provided as part of a specific plan include development of the park north of the allen brook school as described in the open space plan any of the major transportation improvements listed in of the 20162024 town plan  andor any of the improvements listed in of that plan including construction of a new town shop in a suitable location and major sewer and water system improvements 4 town center making a major contribution to the public infrastructure required for the development of a pedestrianfriendly designconscious mixeduse town center consistent with the vision and objectives of the towns comprehensive plan town center development see chapters 3 and 4 of the 20162024 town plan specifically 33 taft corners 42 commercial design and 43 mixed use see also the vision presented in willistons successful application for growth center designation 5 jobs providing significant job retention or expansion in a basic industry may also be considered a substantial benefit but only when combined with at least one of the other substantial public benefits listed above what is a basic industry a basic industry is one that exports goods services andor information from the region while williston is a regional shopping hub retailing and personal services are not considered basic adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 9  | 3 6 transit where transit is available any development permitted by a specific plan that will employee 100 or more people must provide discount bus passes to its employees and otherwise participate in the available transportation demand management programs 7 consultation in making its determination of substantial benefit the planning commission shall consult as appropriate with the conservation commission the historic and architectural advisory committee the dpw and other town boards and officials 8 mere compliance is not a substantial public benefit compliance with the requirements of this bylaw is a minimum expectation not a substantial benefit to the community substantial benefits must be actions above and beyond what an applicant would be required to take to comply with this bylaw 93 specific plan procedure  how does the specific plan process begin development of a specific plan begins with an application from one or more landowners to the planning commission this application shall be submitted on the form provided by the administrator and accompanied by all of the materials required on the specific plan application checklist  how does the planning commission respond to an application to create a specific plan the planning commission will review the application at a regularly scheduled meeting if the commission tentatively determines that a substantial benefit may result from adoption of the proposed specific plan it will schedule public review of the application  how will the public be involved in reviewing a proposed specific plan the review process will always end with public hearings before the planning commission and the selectboard but will begin with a community meeting and in most cases the appointment of a citizens advisory committee 1 community meeting notice the planning commission will schedule a community meeting regarding the proposed specific plan this informal meeting will be preceded by at least 15 days written notice to all owners of adjoining properties and potentially affected public service providers and agencies notice will also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in williston and provided by such other means as the applicants and commission agree notice will be provided by the applicants at their expense failure to provide timely notice will end the process 2 community meeting procedure the community meeting on a proposed specific plan will be informal the applicants will present their proposal for discussion following that discussion the planning commission will  decide not to continue the process having determined that no substantial community benefit is likely result  or  determine in written findings that substantial community benefits could result and appoint a citizen advisory committee to work with the applicants to develop the specific plan adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 9  | 4  the planning commission may also determine again in written findings that the proposed specific plan provides a substantial benefits without having the potential of adverse impacts on neighboring properties the towns infrastructure or the environment and direct the applicants to work with staff to complete the specific plan and schedule a public hearing 3 advisory committee composition advisory committees will vary with the nature of the proposed plan but should include  at least one planning commission member   one or more representatives of other town boards as they may be affected or involved  one or more representatives of the affected neighborhood   representatives from adjoining municipalities and state agencies as they may be affected or involved or offer special expertise   members representing the community at large  and  independent experts qualified to contribute to and evaluate the work of the applicants as the specific plan is developed who may serve as ex officio members the goal is to create a committee that is both broadly representative of those whose interests may be affected by the proposed specific plan and wellqualified 4 deadline the planning commission shall impose a reasonable deadline on the work of a specific plan advisory committee  how will the specific plan be developed the applicants will work with the advisory committee andor staff to develop a specific plan within the deadline established by the planning commission the applicants will be responsible for the costs of this process including scheduling and conducting meetings which must be public meetings and providing the services of attorneys designers facilitators and planners as needed  what will the specific plan include a specific plan is a detailed guideline for the development or redevelopment of a given site or sites presented in the form of proposed amendments to the towns comprehensive plan and this bylaw a specific plan also includes a plan

upon completing their work present the proposed specific plan to the planning commission at the next regularly scheduled meeting at which time will allow its consideration 94 adoption of a specific plan adoption of a specific plan will follow the procedures established at 24 vsa  43844385 for the amendment of plans and the procedures established at 24 vsa  44414442 and in of this bylaw for the amendment of this bylaw adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 0  | 1 boundary adjustments this chapter provides for the administrative approval of boundary adjustments where no new building lots are created and there is no adverse impact on roads other public facilities or neighboring uses 101 definition  authority  limitations  what is a boundary adjustment a boundary adjustment is any revision to property lines including revisions to a plat that has been legally filed with the town which moves property lines but creates no new separate lots or parcels and has no adverse impact on access the provision of public services and utilities or neighboring uses a boundary adjustment may occur between two or more adjacent parcels because a boundary adjustment is not a subdivision it may be approved by the administrator  what gives the administrator the authority to approve boundary adjustments this power is delegated to the administrator as authorized by 24 vsa  4464c  are there any limitations on administrative boundary adjustments if the total acreage that would be transferred from one lot or parcel to another as a result of the boundary adjustment would be large enough to subdivide based on the average density permitted in its zoning district which will be taken as a minimum lot size for this purpose the proposed boundary adjustment will be treated as a subdivision for which a discretionary permit is required there are two possible exceptions to this rule 1 drb waiver the administrator may ask the drb to authorize administrative approval of a larger boundary adjustment where an absence of public road access difficult terrain or other physical characteristics of the land involved allow the drb to find that there is no significant potential for future subdivision 2 land conservation boundary adjustments that expand the holdings of the town or other public agencies for land conservation purposes may be of any size 102 administrative boundary adjustment procedure the boundary adjustment procedure begins with the submission of a preliminary sketch for review by the administrator if the administrator finds that the proposed boundary adjustment complies with this bylaw an application form checklist fee and plat must be filed  how does the boundary adjustment process begin the applicant should having first made an appointment visit the administrators office with a preliminary sketch of the proposed boundary adjustment for the administrators review this sketch need not be professionally drawn  what will the administrator look for before authorizing a proposed boundary adjustment the administrator shall determine that 1  no new lot is being created  2  no lot will made nonconforming or more nonconforming  and adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 0  | 2 3  the proposed boundary adjustment will have no adverse impact on access the provision of public services and utilities or neighboring uses  what happens next if the administrator approves my proposed boundary adjustment you must prepare a plat of the proposed boundary adjustment and submit it to the administrator for recording in the towns land records a plat is a legal drawing made by a registered land surveyor it must include all information required by the boundary adjustment application checklist and and be accompanied by the boundary adjustment application form provided by the administrator plats of boundary adjustments must also comply with the surveying standards established by of this bylaw the application must also be accompanied by draft deed documents that include language reflecting the proposed boundary line changes to the affected properties  how do i get the plat of my proposed boundary adjustment recorded the administrator will act on the plat within 15 working days of its receipt if it complies with all requirements of the boundary adjustment application checklist the administrator will sign the plat and submit it for recording in the land records if the plat fails to comply the administrator will return it to the applicant with a list of deficiencies that must be corrected before it can be recorded  can the administrators decision on a proposed boundary adjustment be appealed yes an appeal may be made using the procedure provided by wdb 54 adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 1  | 1 growth management this chapter establishes a competitive growth management system for residential subdivisions the policy basis for this system appears in of the towns comprehensive plan readers are encouraged to read that material first as background for understanding the procedure established here 111 purpose  authority  why does williston limit the pace of residential development the purposes of growth management review are to 1  ensure that residential growth does not exceed the capacity of the towns existing infrastructure and support planning for the expansion of municipal facilities and services  and 2  given the limited capacity of the towns infrastructure to encourage residential subdivisions that successfully implement the goals of the town plan 3 more specifically the residential growth management system adopted here supports the development of a compact pedestrianfriendly mixeduse center in the taft corners growth center by encouraging housing construction in close proximity to that center while also rewarding the protection of open space resources the provision of trails energy conservation and other actions residential developers can take to help implement the town plan  what gives the town authority to limit the rate of development limiting the pace of development to avoid or mitigate any undue impact on existing or planned community facilities or services is specifically authorized by 24 vsa  4422 112 applicability  which developments are subject to growth management review growth management review is required before a proposed residential subdivision or the residential portion of a proposed mixeduse development may apply for a discretionary permit  are there any exceptions to growth management review there is a full exemption for the construction of a single dwelling on certain existing undeveloped parcels the drb has authority but is not required to provide a partial exemption for proposed minor residential subdivisions 1 existing dwelling may be constructed on any undeveloped parcel on which dwellings are permitted by this bylaw that was and has continued to be in separate ownership since the town adopted its first growth management system in 1990 it is important to review the lot merger requirements of this bylaw see wdb 24 before determining that an existing parcel qualifies for this exception adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 1  | 2 2 minor subdivisions the drb may after having evaluated and ranked all proposed residential subdivisions as provided in this chapter allocate as many as four dwelling units each fiscal year to proposed minor residential subdivisions regardless of their score on the evaluation standards established in wdb 116 117 or 118 the parent parcels of residential subdivisions must have a base lot area of the parent parcel of less than 10 acres and the applicant must be requesting no more than two units of allocation to be considered as a minor subdivision why is there a minor subdivision exception this exception is needed to allow the town to adopt evaluation standards that are stringent enough to encourage positive performance by larger subdivisions without penalizing landowners who wish to create only one or two lots from a relatively small parcel 3 affordable housing dwellings meeting the towns requirements as perpetually affordable at 80% or less than the area median income ami as defined in wdb  may receive all of their required allocation separate from the number of allocation units specified by the residential growth target provided in wdb 113 for units proposed in the sewer service area the discretionary permit must include a finding that adequate sewer treatment capacity is available pursuant to wdb 6 for units proposed outside of the sewer service area projects must meet the onsite sewage disposal requirements of wdb 15 l7 113 residential growth target  what is the towns annual residential growth target the town plan sets a residential growth target of 80 dwelling unit equivalents as defined in wdb  per fiscal year  how is a dwelling unit equivalent defined for the purposes of this chapter and for calculating density under wdb one dwelling equivalent is defined as a dwelling unit containing 2 or more bedrooms a dwelling containing only one bedroom or less studio is counted as 05 of a dwelling unit equivalent  is there a geographic component to the growth target yes the town plan provides for 80 dwelling unit equivalents which will be distributed as follows 1  in the sewer service area in the designated growth center 50 dwelling unit equivalents  2  in the sewer service area outside the designated growth center 20 dwelling unit equivalents and 3  outside the sewer service area 10 dwelling unit equivalents 4 shift to the growth center the drb may shift available units from areas outside the growth center to proposed residential and mixeduse developments within the designated growth center 5 accessory dwellings accessory dwellings permitted by wdb 201 are not dwelling unit equivalents for the purposes of this chapter adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 1  | 3  how does affordable housing affect the growth target residential developments that include affordable units as some portion of the dwellings proposed shall be given priority in making allocation decisions in the evaluation criteria of residential developments of the 80 dwellings available for allocation each fiscal year a minimum of 25% of those dwelling units in each allocation area shall be reserved expressly for perpetually affordable housing as defined in wdb  units that are proposed to be perpetually affordable at 80% or less of the area median income may be approved outside of the growth target as provided in wdb 3

subdivisions that have cleared preapplication review on or before december 31 of any year shall be subject to growth management review in the following year except as otherwise exempted if a proposed residential subdivision has not cleared preapplication review by december 31 of a given year it will not be reviewed during the following year  how is growth management review conducted 1 notice to eligible applicants all applicants whose proposed subdivisions qualify for growth management review shall be notified of the date of the drbs growth management hearing see wdb 2 and provided with a growth management questionnaire by january 15 2 growth management questionnaires applicants must return their completed growth management questionnaires by march 1 all representations made on a growth management questionnaire are binding and must be reflected in the application for a discretionary permit if the proposed residential subdivision receives an allocation of dwelling units 3 public hearing the drb shall in march of each year hold a public hearing at which it reviews all proposed residential subdivisions that cleared preapplication review during the preceding year this hearing shall follow the procedures prescribed in for the review of applications for discretionary permits 4 evaluation and ranking following the public hearing required by wdb 3 the drb shall evaluate and rank the proposed residential subdivisions using the evaluation criteria established in this chapter these criteria guide the drb in awarding points to proposed residential subdivisions based on their

provided by wdb 2 2 number of units the drb may allocate only the number of dwelling unit equivalents allowed by the residential growth target adopted in the town plan this does not mean that the drb allocates 80 dwelling unit equivalents each fiscal year it does not the number of dwelling unit equivalents previously allocated is deducted from the growth target for each fiscal year in which those allocations were made ensuring that an average of no more than 80 dwelling units per fiscal year are allocated whats left a chart showing the number of allocations that remain available in each fiscal year may be obtained from williston planning 3 rolling allocation the drb will make allocations based on a 10year timeframe that begins with the upcoming fiscal year any allocation that was not awarded in past fiscal years is void and no longer available for allocation to future projects the drb will have a consistent 10year horizon over which it can make allocations within the rules of wdb 5 and within the limits of sewer treatment capacity as discussed in wdb 6 4 partial allocations the drb may make partial allocations to help create an equitable division of the dwelling units available among proposed residential subdivisions that have equal or essentially equal rankings the drb may also due to the limited availability of dwelling units and the rules adopted here including wdb 5s limit on allocations to any one proposed residential subdivision allocate fewer units to a proposed residential subdivision than were requested in its preapplication or on its growth management checklist 5 maximum allocation there are limits on the number of units of allocation that may be allocated in any of the allocation years no more than 75% of the units available in a given fiscal year and in any of the three allocation areas established by wdb  may be allocated to any one proposed residential subdivision in addition no more than 50% of the number of allocation units in any of the allocation areas may be allocated two or more years prior to the fiscal year the allocation becomes available and no more than 75% of the number of allocation units in any of the allocation areas may be allocated one year prior to the fiscal year the allocation becomes available 6 changes in capacity sewage treatment plant capacity may change due to changing regulations the failure of plant components and other causes the drb shall not allocate units for which adequate sewage treatment plant capacity is not available regardless of the growth target established in the town plan any decision not to allocate units on this basis shall be based on a written finding by the selectboard that changing conditions have resulted in inadequate capacity adopted by the selectboard  amended

outside of the growth target high scoring developments do not compete at the yearly growth management hearing based on information submitted by the applicant as part of their discretionary permit application the drb shall make a finding of fact that the project achieves a score of 70 points or more based on the criteria in wdb 117 118 or 119 and that the project can be supported by available sewer capacity as discussed in wdb 6 8 changes to allocation rules growth management review occurs once a year in march to maintain consistency of review any amendments made to this chapter shall not be effective until immediately following the close of the next growth management hearing applicants who complete preapplication review between january 1 and the upcoming growth management hearing

these standards are intended to maximize the capacity of existing highways  improve traffic safety  limit the potential for conflict between vehicles pedestrians and cyclists  and reduce congestion while providing safe access to private properties these standards also promote connectivity for vehicles cyclists and pedestrians and to provide emergency access facilitate movement and foster a sense of community 131 basic requirement  applicability  what is the basic requirement of this chapter that all developments and all lots uses and structures within developments have safe adequate legal

all development in williston must be fully accessible as required by the americans with disabilities act parking for people with disabilities is addressed in of this bylaw accessibility because the town does not administer a building code its role in ensuring access for people with disabilities is quite limited the principal responsibility for this function lies with the vermont division of fire safety which enforces a state building code the divisions web site is at  135 multiple points of access these standards limit the number of homes that may be served by a single point of road access  how many dwellings may be served by a private driveway where a new private driveway is being established in compliance with wdb 132 the maximum number of dwellings it may serve is limited to five 5 there are two exceptions to this standard 1 existing driveways where an existing private driveway serves more than five 5 parcels and offers the only access to one or more undeveloped parcels it may

loading this chapter sets standards for offstreet parking and loading its intent consistent with policy  and other guidance from the town plan is to minimize the area devoted to surface parking while still ensuring that there is a reasonable supply of parking including spaces that can be safely used by those whose mobility or vision is impaired minimizing the area devoted to surface parking will  protect watershed health which may be adversely impacted by accelerated runoff from new impervious surfaces   conserve energy and make outdoor spaces more useable by moderating microclimatic extremes on intensively developed sites  and  make it more pleasant to walk or cycle in williston by contributing to streetscapes that are both comfortable and lively it is also specifically the intent of these standards to encourage shared parking arrangements the use of parking structures and the use of porous pavements 141 applicability  do these standards apply to all development yes the standards adopted in this chapter apply to all development for which a permit is required by this bylaw existing and proposed parking and loading areas must be clearly shown on the plans submitted with any application for a permit  do other requirements of this bylaw apply to offstreet parking and loading areas yes offstreet parking and loading areas must comply with all relevant standards of this bylaw

onsite infrastructure this chapter establishes standards for the provision of onsite infrastructure including private and public roads utilities and associated improvements these standards are supported by of this bylaw which establishes the procedures needed to ensure that the improvements required here are actually built onsite infrastructure may also be subject to the continuing maintenance standards of chapters 7 and 16 151 basic requirement  applicability  what is the basic requirement of this chapter the basic requirement of this chapter is that developments will be served by adequate onsite infrastructure installed by the developer  what does onsite mean onsite infrastructure is on the land that is proposed for development or in a public rightofway immediately adjoining that land this term may also include necessary extensions of roads or utilities to a development across other lands  do the standards adopted here apply to all development these standards apply to all development for which a discretionary permit is required the plans submitted with applications for discretionary permits must clearly demonstrate compliance with these standards relationship to impact fees williston requires development to contribute to the continuing improvement of its infrastructure in two major ways the first is provision of onsite infrastructure as required by this bylaw while onsite infrastructure may incidentally benefit others it primarily serves the occupantsusers of the development where it is installed the second contribution is payment of impact fees impact fees are used to help cover the costs of offsite infrastructure that is to say of improvements that are in part necessitated by a development but that serve a larger public and may be located miles away 152 circulation many developments will be served by existing roads with access to those roads governed by of this bylaw these standards apply where new roads must be built  will all roads built to serve new development be public no applicants may be required to build public or private roads as explained here  where will public roads be required where a development includes a proposed arterial or collector road that road will be public and designed and built to the appropriate standards of the american association of state highway and transportation officials aashto policy

development andor that will serve 40 or fewer dwellings andor that provide no connection to other lands shall be dedicated to public use but privately maintained by the owner or an owners association as provided by wdb 72 the town may accept some local roads as provided by wdb 3 1 very lowvolume roads where a private road will serve 40 or fewer dwellings or a projected traffic volume of 400 adt or less it shall be designed and built to comply with adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 5  | 2 the current edition of the american association of state highway and transportation officials guide for the geometric design of very low volume local roads and willistons public works standards lowvolume private roads that serve residential development with an average density of one dwelling per 10 acres or less may be unpaved 2 other private roads private roads that will serve more than 40 dwellings or carry more than 400 adt traffic must be designed and built to comply with the current edition of the american association of state highway and transportation officials policy on the geometric design of highways and streets and willistons public works standards 3 town acceptance of local roads the town may choose to accept a new local road that provides access to a municipal or other public facility or where the connectivity required by the town plan and of this bylaw is not provided by an existing road where the town will accept a local road it must be designed and built to comply with the current edition of the american association of state highway and transportation officials policy on the geometric design of highways and streets and willistons public works standards  must sidewalks or recreation paths be provided along roads sidewalks that are designed and built to comply with willistons public works standards must be provided along both sides of all proposed roads except 1  where the town plan calls for the provision of a recreation path along the proposed road which must be provided instead  or 2  where the drb finds that the type andor density of development served by the proposed road does not necessitate a sidewalk or recreation path or at least a sidewalk or recreation path on both sides of the road in making this determination the drb shall be guided by these principles  the drb may limit the requirement for a sidewalk to only one side of a proposed road in areas of low intensity commercial or industrial development where it does so it may require the provision of signed andor striped crosswalks to properties on the side of the road that has no sidewalk  the drb may modify or eliminate the requirement for a sidewalk where safe adequate bicycle and pedestrian circulation is provided by an offstreet system of paths  sidewalks will not ordinarily be required in the arzd due to the low density of development permitted in that zoning district recreation paths and primitive trails will be required as shown in the town plan and may also be required to create or enhance connectivity in open space developments as provided by wdb  where can i find the map of proposed trails in the town plan existing and proposed trails are shown on map 11 and map 17of the town plan 3 crosswalks signed andor striped crosswalks must be provided at all intersections the drb may also require midblock crossings to serve specific destinations and additional measures to ensure the safety of cyclists and pedestrians including textured crosswalks and other streetscape design features signs and traffic calming the drb may permit an adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 5  | 3 exception to this standard where an applicant would otherwise be required to install a crosswalk that does not connect to a pedestrian way on the other side a street  are there standards for the drainage of roads all roads shall be properly drained as required by

required street trees must be planted as required by what about bus stops applicants whose projects will benefit from transit service may be required to provide or contribute to the provision of bus stop pullouts shelters and signage 153 neighborhood parks like the other onsite infrastructure required by this chapter neighborhood parks are required improvements subject to all applicable requirements of the maintenance requirements of are developers required to provide neighborhood parks of the open space plan provides detailed guidance for the provision of neighborhood parks in residential developments the drb must find that all proposed residential developments comply with that guidance note also that the growth management review standards adopted in of this bylaw encourage the provision of neighborhood recreational space  are neighborhood parks open space neighborhood parks come in different forms depending on the character of the neighborhood they serve some may be quite urban including lots of hard surfaces they are not automatically included in open space where it is required by this bylaw but may be included where the drb finds that they serve open space functions  when does access to an existing park fulfill the open space plans guidance for neighborhood parks of the open space plan provides that proposed residential developments may be served by an existing community park rather than providing a new neighborhood park this will be permitted where the existing park is within 1320 feet walking distance of the majority of dwellings in the proposed residential development where the walk to the existing park does not involve crossing an arterial road and where the proposed development makes a cash contribution to the continuing development of community parks via an increased impact fee  when is a proposed residential development too small to provide a neighborhood park the applicant may propose to provide a neighborhood park in a residential development of any size consistent with of the open space plan however a neighborhood park will not be required in any proposed residential development that has fewer than 15 dwellings increased impact fee the upcoming revision of the parks and recreation impact fee will require a higher fee from dwellings in developments that rely on existing parks rather than providing a neighborhood park  must neighborhood park space be developed consistent with of the open space plan only basic development of neighborhood parks consisting of grading the installation of turf adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 5  | 4 and other ground covers and the planting of trees is required further development and maintenance of the park will be the responsibility of the owners association note however that in order to receive a point award on the growth management review standards of of this bylaw the applicant must provide additional facilities or a park development fund that may be used by the owners association 155 private utilities  must the plans i submit show utilities that are not provided by the town yes cable television electric power and natural gas may be provided as available and in accord with the requirements of each service provider the plans submitted with the application for a discretionary permit must show

municipal  is access to willistons municipal sewerage system limited yes all proposed development must have or obtain an allocation of sewage treatment plant capacity as provided by willistons sewer allocation for residential developments the growth management review system established by of this bylaw an allocation certificate signed by the dpw must accompany all applications for permits for development that requires sewage treatment plant capacity  which developments must connect to the towns sewerage system development within the sewer service area established in the town plan and the sewer allocation be connected to the municipal sewerage system via a collection system that includes all necessary pump stations or pump station improvements and that meets the design and construction standards established by willistons public works standards and state law the dpw may permit an exception to this standard where physical barriers including property ownership or the terrain make connection to the municipal sewerage system infeasible and where an onsite wastewater disposal system that complies with wdb 156 exists or can be installed what are the boundaries of the sewer service area see map 8 of the town plan  does this mean that existing development may have to connect yes the requirement of wdb  applies not only to new lots and structures but also to existing structures that are within 150 feet of a sewer main that has adequate capacity existing structures must connect in order to obtain an administrative permit to proceed with a change of use or an addition of more than 600 square feet the dpw may permit an exception to this standard where physical barriers including property ownership or the terrain make connection to the municipal sewerage system infeasible and where an onsite wastewater disposal system that complies with wdb 158 exists or can be installed  are there any other limitations on municipal sewerage service pretreatment of certain kinds of

meets all standards established by the vermont department of environmental conservation shall accompany the application for a discretionary or administrative permit whichever is required these plans must be prepared and certified by a licensed designer what is a licensed designer see  for an explanation of this state program  how does the town know that an onsite sewage disposal system has been installed as designed no certificate of compliance shall be issued and no development occupied until asbuilt plans for the onsite sewage disposal system have been filed with the administrator  are community wastewater disposal systems permitted yes but only in specific situations in the arzd see wdb 3110 158 solid waste solid waste collection in williston is provided by the private sector this

reservoirs 1511 water onsite this standard is adopted to protect the town and its utility rate payers from the necessity of extending municipal water service over long distances to serve areas where the groundwater supply is limited  will development that is not served by the municipal water system be permitted yes but where the use of an onsite water supply is proposed the applicant must demonstrate that groundwater sufficient to support the development is available this must be done by conducting onsite well tests under the supervision of a registered engineer or a groundwater hydrologist  how should well tests be conducted and is this requirement ever waived well tests shall be conducted in accord with the current requirements of the vermont water supply rule for longterm yield testing the drb may waive the requirement of wdb  for an onsite well adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 5  | 6 test where the average density of the proposed development is one dwelling per 10 acres or less and the geologic mapping available to the town suggests that the groundwater supply will be sufficient for very low density residential development  must wells be tested for water quality whenever a well test is required by wdb  the water yielded shall also be tested for basic drinking water quality parameters and radon 1512 extensions of service  are there geographic limits on the extension of town infrastructure yes see wdb 156 and wdb  sewerage may not be extended outside the sewer service area established in the town plan except in response to a public health emergency additional water service may not be extended into the arzd except again where necessary to address a public health emergency nor may water service be extended into areas that cannot be served by gravity flow  will the town ever participate in extensions of service needed to support development the dpw may with the approval of the selectboard choose to provide partial funding for the extension of town roads or utilities to a development where doing so will help correct a deficiency in the existing circulation or utilities systems or where the proposed extension will provide capacity for the anticipated development of other lands  can the town recoup the costs it incurs in extending service yes at least in part where the town funds an

compatibility potential hazards potential nuisances the standards adopted in this chapter help ensure land use compatibility by adopting standards that prevent hazards and nuisances compatibility is also a goal of many other requirements of this bylaw including the prohibition of certain uses in certain zoning districts and s standards for landscaped buffers 181 basic requirement  applicability  what is the basic requirement of the chapter the basic requirement of this chapter is that no development should present a hazard to or constitute a nuisance for the occupants of adjoining lands  does the town have the authority to address existing or continuing nuisances that may not be development yes 24 vsa  22911217 provide clear authority for the town to define and regulate nuisances  do the standards adopted here apply to all development yes the only exceptions from these standards are those explicitly noted in this chapter or those permitted by variance  can the administrator refer uses that would otherwise be permitted with only an administrative permit but that have the potential to become a nuisance to the drb yes the administrator may refer uses that will generate smoke odor or other potential nuisances to the drb which may require that the application for an administrative permit be converted to an application for a discretionary permit 182 dangerous buildings  does this bylaw regulate dangerous buildings yes buildings that meet the criteria established in wdb  are public nuisances as such they are violations of this bylaw subject to enforcement as provided in wdb 7476  what constitutes a dangerous building the intent here is to define buildings that pose a hazard to public safety personnel  including fire fighters emergency medical technicians police officers and others who may be required to enter these buildings if they are flooded or on fire to perform a search or rescue or to enforce the law  as dangerous and therefore as public nuisances there is no intent to declare a building dangerous on aesthetic grounds due to a temporary lack of maintenance or due to the fact that it is awaiting renovations for which an application for a permit has been submitted the criteria the administrator will use to determine whether a building is dangerous are listed below a building need not meet all of these criteria to be considered dangerous 1  the presence of charred or burnt surfaces andor structural members like framing or girders remaining from an explosion or fire  2  the presence of exposed structural members like framing or girders that were not intended to be exposed when the building was built  adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 8  | 2 3  the absence of window glass or the presence of broken windows and glass litter on the floors or the surrounding ground  4  the presence of a roof stairs or a floor that will not reliably support the weight of a fire fighter or of open pits shafts or wells  5  the presence or suspected presence of abandoned hazardous materials or wastes  and 6  that the building is open to unauthorized entry via a door window or other opening 7 the administrator will consult with the williston fire and police departments and with the towns public health officer before determining that a building is dangerous  will i get some warning before being required to fix or demolish a dangerous building yes the town will begin enforcement of these standards for dangerous buildings using the procedure established at wdb 74 this procedure gives a property owner seven days to respond to a notice of violation 183 air quality air quality in williston is regulated by the state of vermont the standards adopted here seek to prevent some common air quality problems by anticipating the impacts of proposed developments where can i learn about state air quality regulations the air pollution control division of the vermont department of environmental conservation is online at   are there standards for dust suppression yes 1 during construction dust suppression shall be provided at construction sites in accord with the public works standards 2 after construction generally sites will be stabilized with buildings paving and landscaping and produce only incidental dust some industrial and mining processes are expected to produce dust however and so are recreational uses that use dirt trails or roads these uses are confined to the arzd and the industrial zoning districts within those districts the drb may require applicants to provide dust suppression andor additional landscaped buffering to protect adjoining properties andor prevent dust blowing across public ways  what about uses that generate smoke no development shall generate smoke that could adversely affect occupants or users of adjoining properties where the drb finds that smoke will not ordinarily be confined on the property where it is generated or at least within an industrial zoning district it may simply prohibit the proposed use the drb may also consistent with state air pollution laws require measures that would mitigate the anticipated nuisance  are there standards for the placement of exhaust fans stacks vents and similar equipment yes the plans submitted with applications for administrative or discretionary permits for uses that will have these types of equipment or installations must demonstrate that proposed adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 8  | 3 exhaust vents stacks fans and similar equipment will not direct cooking odors gases hot air smoke steam or vapor onto adjacent properties or public ways  what if my development will stink are there standards for odors different people experience odors in different ways making regulation difficult industrial processes or other uses that may reasonably be expected to produce odors that some people will find offensive shall be confined in the industrial zoning district west where the drb finds that the anticipated odor will not or cannot ordinarily be confined on the property where it is generated or at least within an industrial zoning district it may simply prohibit the proposed use the drb may also consistent with state air pollution laws require measures that would mitigate the anticipated nuisance do the standards adopted here apply to landfill odor no state law protects regional landfills from local regulations that would interfere with their intended function see wdb  do these standards apply to odors generated by farming operations no accepted agricultural practices are exempted by wdb 2 and protected by vermonts righttofarm law 12 vsa  5751 et seq 184 buffering see for this bylaws standards for landscaped buffers between uses 185 hazardous materials hazardous materials will be as defined by the uniform fire ufc fire here are the basic definitions of hazardous material from the uniform fire details may be found in that code it is important to have a clear understanding of the fire code and of the applicable state and federal regulations when proposing a use that will involve the storage handling or disposal of hazardous materials 3 hazardous material a chemical or substance that is classified as a physical hazard material or a health hazard material whether the chemical or substance is in usable or waste condition see also 5 health hazard material and 10 physical hazard material 500 2006 5 health hazard material a chemical or substance classified as a toxic highly toxic

flammable gas flammable liquid flammable solid organic peroxide oxidizer oxidizing cryogen pyrophoric unstable reactive or waterreactive material 500 2006  will the williston fire department review my plans for a development that involves hazardous materials yes proposed developments that may reasonably be expected to involve the storage handling or disposal of hazardous materials will be referred to the williston fire department for review  what standards will be used in reviewing my plans for a development that involves hazardous materials the town will rely on of the uniform fire which is hereby adopted by reference plans submitted with an application for an administrative or discretionary permit for a proposed development that involves the storage handling or disposal of hazardous materials must clearly show how that development complies with supporting requirements of the ufc  will i be required to submit a hazardous materials management plan possibly the drb with the advice of the williston fire department may require submission of a hazardous materials management plan adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 8  | 4  must i maintain the measures required by of the uniform fire  yes failure to maintain the hazardous materials management measures required by of the ufc is a violation of this bylaw subject to enforcement as provided by wdb 7476 186 hours of operation the drb may limit the hours of operation of commercial industrial and institutional uses to protect the residents of nearby dwellings andor or the residents of mixed use buildings these limits may set the hours when deliveries and solid waste collection are permitted as well as the hours when the use is open 187 lightglare standards for outdoor lighting are found in of this bylaw the standards adopted here address glare from other sources  must welding equipment or other sources of intense light be screened from public view yes intense sources of light like welding equipment must be fully screened from view from adjoining properties and public ways by enclosure in a building or by an opaque screening fence or wall  what about building materials that shine or reflect designers should choose building materials that do not generate glare the drb may require that roof wall or other materials be nonreflective the drb may also limit the glass area presented by a building to minimize glare wdb 3 provides additional authority to limit the use of reflective materials in the arzd 188 litter  is litter removal a continuing condition of approval yes litter removal is part of the continuing maintenance required by this bylaw  must areas where solid waste or other materials that may become windborne be fenced or screened to suppress blowing litter yes see wdb  189 livestock as explained by wdb 2 vermont municipalities cannot regulate accepted agricultural practices including the keeping of livestock see wdb 2010 re the keeping of livestock on residential premises 1810 noise  doesnt williston already have a noise ordinance yes that ordinance which is attached as appendix f regulates all sources of noise including existing land uses these standards do not take the place of that ordinance their purpose is to provide a basis for the drbs review of proposed developments with the goal of ensuring that new uses will not generate excessive levels of sound  what are the limits on the level of sound generated by proposed developments no development that can reasonably be expected to generate sound exceeding the maximum levels set in table 18a shall be permitted  can i be required to present a study of potential sound levels yes where there is a question about compliance with this standard the drb may require the applicant to provide evidence in the form of a report prepared by a qualified firm whose qualifications are acceptable to the administrator such reports shall show projected noise contours around the proposed source adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 8  | 5 extending as far out as the 50 dbal10 contour such a report may also be required to show the sound transmission coefficient of the proposed building materials  can the drb require noise mitigation measures yes 1 mitigation measures the drb may require the construction or installation of noise mitigation measures including landscaped berms walls and the use of soundproofing architectural techniques this requirement may be imposed both on new noise sources and on proposed developments that will be exposed to noise from existing sources 2 operating hours the drb may also limit operating hours of commercial industrial and institutional uses in order to mitigate potential noise conflicts see also wdb 186 3 where uses are mixed compliance with this standard is particularly important in buildings where different intensities of use will be mixed as provided in of this bylaw the drb may require an applicant to demonstrate that nighttime interior sound levels in the residential portions of mixeduse developments will not exceed 40 dbal10 table 18a  maximum anticipated sound levels the maximum sound levels given in this table are measured in aweighted decibels dba maximum sound levels may briefly exceed these levels but for no more than 10 minutes out of an hour making these levels

clearly show how utility installations mechanical equipment solid waste containers and the like will be effectively screened from view from neighboring properties and public ways  how should ground level screening be provided 1 hedge screening for utility installations mechanical equipment solid waste containers and the like must include a dense evergreen hedge and other plant materials that are at least five 5 feet deep the drb may permit an exception to this standard where space or technical limitations make landscaped screening infeasible where the drb permits an exception a screening fence or wall shall be provided in compliance with wdb 2 2 berm fence or wall the drb may require that a berm fence or wall be used to supplement the landscaped screening fence or wall materials patterns and colors must match or complement the materials architectural details and colors used on buildings on the site 3 blowing litter the drb will require a fence or wall where necessary to trap blowing litter or other debris  must roofmounted equipment be screened yes roofmounted utility installations mechanical equipment and the like must be fully screened from view from neighboring properties and public views using location on the roof or parapets or other architectural extensions of the building this standard does not require that roofmounted equipment be screened from views from a taller building or higher ground for the purposes of this standard visibility will be determined from ground level from the centerline of the adjoining public ways note that telecommunications equipment is generally exempt from this requirement but see of this bylaw 1813 vibration  what are the limits on vibrations generated by a proposed development no use that may reasonably be expected to generate vibrations that may be sensed at the property line without instruments shall be permitted the drb may permit exceptions to this standard in the industrial zoning districts but only where a vibration study as required by wdb  clearly demonstrates that there will be no adverse impact on neighboring properties or public ways  can i be required to present a study of potential vibrations yes where there is a question about compliance with this standard the drb may require the applicant to provide evidence in the form of a report prepared by a qualified firm whose qualifications are acceptable to the administrator such reports shall show the projected levels of vibration generated by the proposed development along all property lines adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston

for the zoning districts created in this bylaw by explaining how the density or intensity of development is defined measured and regulated this chapter also establishes a voluntary transfer of development rights program 191 applicability  definitions  do the definitions and standards adopted here apply throughout the town yes  what is density density is the general term used to describe how intensively a parcel of land is or may be used density is measured differently for different uses and in different situations  how is density measured per wdb  one dwelling unit is defined as a dwelling unit containing 2 or more bedrooms a dwelling containing only one bedroom or less studio is counted as 05 of a dwelling unit the density of residential development in williston is measured in the number of dwelling unit equivalents per acre acreage encompasses everything within the platted boundaries of the development it includes buildings streets sidewalks stormwater detention ponds all other improvements and most types of open space there are some exceptions which are explained in wdb 1 and 2 what is a dwelling a dwelling is a building typically a singlefamily home or a separate space within a larger building typically an apartment townhouse or the like that contains complete housekeeping facilities for one household 1 accessory dwellings accessory dwellings permitted by wdb 201 are not counted as dwellings when calculating density 2 acreage exceptions there are three exceptions from the acreage used as a basis for calculating density and one partial exception these exceptions apply in all zoning districts  the acreage on a proposed development site that is included within the watershed protection buffers required by of this bylaw will not be included in the gross acreage of that site for the purposes of calculating the permitted density  the acreage on a proposed development site that has an average slope of 30% or more will not be included in the gross acreage of that site for the purposes of calculating the permitted density  the acreage on a proposed development site that has an average slope of 15 30% will be included in the gross acreage of that site but only at the rate established for development on slopes in the applicable zoning district that rate is one dwelling unit for every 10 acres in the arzd see wdb 6 and one dwelling unit per acre in the rzd and vzd zoning districts see wdb 2 and wdb  adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 9  | 2 3 rounding residential density calculations often result in fractions for example a 17acre parcel in the arzd is permitted to have 762 dwellings does that mean it can have eight no conventional mathematical rounding rules are not used for the density calculations required by this bylaw a parcel must contain all of the acreage required for an additional unit in the arzd a parcel has to contain at least 1769 acres to be permitted eight dwellings  how is density measured for nonresidential developments there is no universally useful measure of the density or intensity of nonresidential developments the density of nonresidential developments is limited and determined by the standards of this bylaw there is a practical minimum area for any given nonresidential development but that area must be determined casebycase based on what is required to comply with the applicable standards see wdb 193 192 residential densities policies 32 and 34 of the town plan provide background materials that you might want to read before going on to the rest of this chapter  what is the purpose of these residential density standards the definitions and standards adopted in this chapter are intended to   implement the open space policies adopted in the town plan especially policies 32 and 34 and open space and working landscapes    help implement the affordable housing policies adopted in the town plan see   and   give landowners and developers the flexibility needed to protect open space while creating compact and amenable neighborhoods to achieve these purposes williston requires open space residential development which is defined in wdb  because it can be difficult to design an open space development on smaller parcels williston also permits infill development which is defined at wdb   what is an open space development an open space development is a residential subdivision in which a specified area of open space is protected as a condition of approval how much open space is required varies with the zoning district open space development is required on parcels larger than 105 acres in the arzd and rzd parcels in the vzd and smaller parcels in the arzd and rzd may also be developed using an open space pattern but where this is proposed it must be approved by the drb during preapplication review  what is an infill development some parcels of land are too small to effectively use for open space development specifically all residential developments that include 105 or fewer acres and all residential developments within the vzd will be treated as infill developments for the purposes of this bylaw except where an exception is permitted by the drb as provided in wdb  all other residential developments must be open space developments  so how do i know how many homes i can build on my land each residential zoning district has both a permitted net density and a minimum area per dwelling unit these standards are shown in table 19a adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 9  | 3 1 net density the average density column in table 19a tells you the maximum number of homes that can be built it applies to both open space and infill developments applicants may make choices that reduce the average density permitted see for example wdb 1 but the standards of table 19a are the starting point for example if you have a 40acre parcel in the arzd that includes no watershed protection buffers and no slopes of 15% of more table 19a shows that you can build 22 dwelling units see wdb 2 for an explanation of how having watershed protection buffers or slopes on your property affects the permitted density 2 minimum area the minimum area per dwelling unit may be different for open space and infill developments and is applied in different ways to different types of development see wdb  table 19a  permitted residential densities zoning district net density minimum area per dwelling in an open space development minimum area per dwelling in an infill development arzd 1 dwelling per 80000 sf 55 duea 15000 sf 344 a 80000 sf 184 a rzd open space developments 300 duea developments with minimum 30% affordable housing as specified in wdb   500 duea 5445 sf  a 14520 33 a vzd 200 duea 6534 sf 015 a 6534 sf 015 a the net density given here is for development on slopes of less than 15% development on slopes of 1529% is permitted only at the lower average densities established in wdb 2 slopes of 30% of more are not included in the acreage base for development  but how can i build that many homes if i am required to protect buffers along streams conservation areas slopes wetlands and other resources this is where the minimum area per dwelling unit comes in the combination of an average density with a minimum area per dwelling unit gives landowners and developers the flexibility to protect open space while meeting the demand for housing it will also help make new residential neighborhoods more compact and thus more affordable and pedestrianfriendly is this cluster development yes the approach the town is taking toward most residential development has been called cluster development open space development is used in the town plan and this bylaw because it emphasizes the goal of open space protection 1 minimum area individual minimum area per dwelling unit can be interpreted as a minimum lot size in developments where buyers will get a lot no lot can be adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 9  | 4 smaller than the minimum area per dwelling unit do note however that wdb  prohibits developments with uniform lot sizes imagine for example a 40acre parcel in the arzd this parcel has no slopes or watershed protection buffers so 22 dwelling units are permitted but wdb  requires that 75% remain in open space can the owner still plat 22 lots if he or she is willing and the site is favorable to install community sewerage systems for each cluster of lots there is generally a limit of seven home sites per cluster 22 lots could be approved on the 10 acres that are not set aside as open space the shape and size of the lots must vary with the terrain but the smallest lots can be as small as 15000 sf allowing some flexibility in the proposed subdivisions design 2 minimum area without the proposed development will be an apartment building or complex that will remain in one ownership or a condominium where the land will be held in common by the homeowners the minimum area per dwelling unit determines the smallest area that can be used for buildings parking and other improvements imagine for example an 80acre parcel in the rzd that includes extensive 30 acres wetlands and a rare plant community 10 acres table 19a permits 240 dwelling units on that site 80 x 3 but given the natural constraints it would be difficult to plat even that many conventional residential lots further unless the wetlands and rare plants happen to be located in one corner of the parcel adjacent to another open space conventional development will have a fragmenting impact on those resources better resource protection and better utilization of land and infrastructure can be achieved by shrinking the footprint of the housing using the minimum area per unit of 5445 sf this bylaw would permit all 240 units to be placed on less than 40 acres this leaves ample space for a development that could take the form of flats town homes or other attached housing types placing 240 units on say 375 acres results in roughly the same density as many of willistons existing condominium developments 64 dua how does all this really work landowners who are unsure about how to comply with the open space development requirements of this bylaw are encouraged to make an appointment with a staff person at williston planning you may also want to seek the advice of an experienced design professional 193 nonresidential densities  are minimum lot sizes required for the nonresidential uses that permitted in the arzd rzd and vzd yes 1 in the arzd a minimum lot size of 80000 sf is required for nonresidential uses in the arzd 2 in the rzd and vzd a minimum lot size of 20000 sf is required for nonresidential uses in the rzd and vzd  are there minimum lot sizes for nonresidential development in the other zoning districts there is no minimum lot size for nonresidential uses in the other zoning districts the density or intensity of nonresidential development that is permitted in those districts will be a function of the standards of this bylaw as applicable 194 mixeduse densities willistons town plan emphasizes the desirability of mixeduse development in the growth center and mixeduse development is permitted or even required in the bpzd gzds gzdw muczd murzd and tczd each zoning district has its own standards for which uses may be mixed and how those standards are summarized in table 19b mixeduses are also permitted in the vzd in compliance with the standards established in of this bylaw

column in table 19b for a summary of the standards adopted in the chapters establishing each zoning district  how many dwelling units are permitted in a mixeduse development the net permitted density of the residential component of a mixeduse development is shown in table 19b that table also imposes a minimum density of five dwelling units per acre on residential development in most of the mixeduse zoning districts and shows that the net permitted density may rise to 10 or 15 dua with the transfer of development rights the transfer of development rights is explained in wdb 195  how much nonresidential development is permitted in a mixeduse development the density of the nonresidential component of a mixeduse development will be a function of the limit if any on the mix of uses in the

 what is the transfer of development rights a transfer of development rights occurs when the right to develop on one parcel of land is used on a noncontiguous parcel the parcels involved may be in the same or different ownerships  is the transfer of development rights permitted in williston yes residential development rights may be voluntarily transferred from lands in the arzd or from conservation areas shown in the open space plan in other zoning districts to lands within the growth center development rights may be transferred onetoone up to the maximum density permitted in the receiving zoning district by tables 19a and 19b  is special permission required for a transfer of development rights no transfers are permitted within the density limits established in tables 19a and 19b the resulting development must of course comply with all requirements of this bylaw adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 1 9  | 6  what are the mechanics of a transfer of development rights a transfer of development rights is a private transaction while it is enabled and encouraged by this bylaw the town does not require tdrs 1 tdrs at preapplication an applicant who proposes to use tdrs in a development must make this clear in the preapplication materials 2 tdrs and growth management a tdr does not exempt the proposed dwelling units from growth management review as required by of this bylaw 3 tdrs at permit review drafts of the instruments of conveyance for the tdr must accompany the application for a discretionary permit 4 tdrs in final plans the signed instruments of conveyance for the tdr must accompany the final plans they must be recorded after approval of the final plans and before an administrative permit for any work on the site is approved can you give me an example of how the transfer of development rights works yes suppose that you have a small farm in the arzd you could if able to comply with all requirements of this bylaw create 22 home sites on 40 acres but really you only want to build a home for yourself can you use the other 21 development rights in another way possibly suppose that a developer in the tafts corners area wants to build a mixedused project on 10 acres without a transfer of development rights table 19b says that this project can have 75 dua or 75 total units with a transfer however it can have as many as 150 units 15 dua the developer could if you name a reasonable price purchase your 21 development rights and build 96 of the 150 units permitted with a tdr this moves development into the growth center in accord with town policy while helping protect the character of rural williston adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 0  | 1 residential improvements this chapter consolidates the definitions and standards for minor improvements to residentially developed property the standards adopted here apply to all dwellings in all zoning districts requirements that may or may not apply depending on a dwellings location are crossreferenced 201 accessory dwellings 24 vsa  44121e states that no bylaw shall have the effect of excluding as a permitted use one accessory dwelling unit that is located within or appurtenant to an owneroccupied singlefamily dwelling  what is an accessory dwelling for the purposes of this chapter an accessory dwelling is an independent efficiency or one or two bedroom dwelling that is located within or on the same lot as an owneroccupied singlefamily dwelling and that complies with the standards established below  is a permit needed for an accessory dwelling yes an administrative permit is required for any accessory dwelling  what standards apply to accessory dwellings an administrative permit for a proposed accessory dwelling shall be approved if the administrator finds that it complies with the following standards 1 owneroccupied either the singlefamily dwelling or the proposed accessory dwelling must be owneroccupied what does owneroccupied mean the dwelling or propsoed accessory dwelling must be the principal residence of at least one of the owners named on the grand list 2 floor area the proposed accessory dwelling must occupy no more than 30% of the total floor area of the dwelling to which it is accessory or where the parcel is larger than onehalf acre but too small to subdivide in the zoning district in which it is located no more than 50% of the total floor area of the dwelling to which it is accessory with a maximum size for any accessory dwelling of 1500 square feet applicants must provide a floor andor site plan drawn to scale and in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this standard 3 using an existing dwelling as an accessory to a new dwelling these standards present the possibility that an existing twobedroom dwelling of 1500 sf or less could be used as an accessory dwelling by an owner who proposes to build a new home of up to 3000 sf this is not prohibited but will require a discretionary permit 4 shared driveway approval of an accessory dwelling must not result in a new point of access to a public road the administrator may with the advice of the dpw waive this requirement where the terrain or other physical characteristics of the site make it safer for an accessory dwelling to have a separate point of access adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 0  | 2 5 offstreet parking there must be sufficient offstreet parking for the proposed accessory dwelling one offstreet parking space is required for each efficiency or onebedroom accessory dwelling and two offstreet parking spaces are required for each twobedroom accessory dwelling applicants must provide a site plan that is drawn to scale and in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this standard 6 wastewater wastewater treatment capacity for the proposed accessory dwelling is available as part of an allocation of sewage treatment plant capacity or as part of the capacity of an existing or proposed onsite wastewater treatment system  where the proposed accessory dwelling would be served by the towns sewerage system the applicant must submit an allocation form signed by the dpw  where the proposed accessory dwelling would be served by an onsite wastewater treatment system the applicant must submit i approved final plans showing that an existing system has sufficient capacity ii plans for a new system prepared by a licensed designer or iii a licensed designers

review is established under a different authority in of this bylaw  is all development in the design review district subject to the standards adopted here no the design review standards adopted in this chapter apply broadly all new commercial industrial and institutional buildings and multiplefamily dwellings and major additions to those buildings are covered the design review standards adopted in this chapter do not apply to one and two family dwellings or to accessory structures that are not visible from a public way  if these standards only say should do i really have to comply yes to the extent feasible the use of should and similar formulations of standards in this chapter does not exempt anyone from compliance this language is instead an acknowledgement of the wide range of building and adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 2  | 2 site types and contexts and of the difficulty of writing design review standards that can address this diversity should provides some flexibility for the drb to accept practical solutions that are in the spirit of the town plan and these standards 223 architectural design form color and materials the form shape colors and materials used in the surrounding buildings are after signs the most noticeable feature of a streetscape how well they are designed will be a major determinant of the success  both commercially and as a part of the community  of a development  respect the context the choice of building form colors and materials should be compatible with the surrounding landscape and built environment it is especially important that the bulk and proportions height width depth not be a radical departure from the context except in redeveloping areas where larger buildings are consistent with the town plan or an applicable specific plan  form should follow function building facades should reflect true building form or to say it another way the buildings functions false fronts are generally inappropriate  provide enclosure streets and outdoor spaces like urban parks greens plazas squares whatever you call them function best if the surrounding buildings are tall enough to provide a sense of enclosure construction of multiple story buildings is strongly encouraged in some zoning districts bpzd muczd murzd tczd but this principle applies everywhere  size outdoor spaces properly urban parks the generic term for greens plazas squares and similar outdoor spaces are not comfortable for users if they are too large these spaces should be sized appropriately so that a sense of enclosure is provided by the surrounding buildings and landscaping how big is too big a ruleof thumb is that the width of an urban park the distance between the surrounding buildings including sidewalks and streets if any are present as well as the urban park should be no more than about twice 2x the height of the surrounding buildings so the maximum width of an urban park where there is a 36foot height limit should not be much more than 72 feet the performance standard adopted above provides designers and the drb with some flexibility by not stating a number  use a variety of colors and materials but with restraint a variety of colors and materials with different textures should be used to create visual interest in buildings but the variation in color and materials should not be simply for varietys sake it should reflect the functions that must be served for example the sign band on a building or group of buildings could be used to introduce a different color and material likewise different materials could be used to mark entrances as required by wdb   avoid dead walls dead walls are prohibited in the most pedestrianoriented zoning districts muczd murzd tczd but should be avoided in many other situations at the least architectural features including doors windows and detailing should offer some horizontal andor vertical relief from monotonous walls  do not use reflective materials designers should choose building materials that do not generate glare the drb may require that roof wall or other materials be nonreflective the drb may also limit the glass area presented by a building to minimize glare wdb 3 provides additional authority to limit the use of reflective materials in the arzd and gzds adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 2  | 3 224 architectural design doors and windows doors and windows connect a building to the community how they are placed and spaced is an important element of the streetscape  mark building entrances 1 entrances and architecture principal building entrances should be marked by architectural features that make their location readily visible from the parking areas pedestrian ways and streets that serve the building 2 entrances and the site plan wayfinding to the principal entrances of the building should be reinforced by the site plan including the placement of sidewalks landscaping outdoor lighting signage and the location of functional outdoor areas which may relate to but not obscure the entrance 3 relationship to the street a strong direct relationship between principal building entrances and the street is required in some zoning districts see the bpzd muczd murzd and tczd  protect building entrances 1 from the climate principal building entrances must be provided with permanent overhead protection from the elements including ice and snow falling from the roof 2 from conflicts service areas including dumpster and utility enclosures must be separated from principal building entrances isnt that obvious williston actually has some particularly egregious violations of this standard people who want to dine at the ponderosa walk right by the dumpster enclosure depending on where they park office workers in building c of maple tree place must pass between dumpsters and loading doors  provide airlocks principal entrances to buildings must incorporate an airlock this standard does not apply to entrances for vehicles to loading doors or to emergency exits used for that purpose only the drb may permit other exceptions to this standard for minor entrances  use doors and windows to provide a strong but compatible visual pattern or rhythm the placement and spacing of doors and windows should create a consistent rhythm and the size and design of doors and windows must be compatible with the buildings overall size and bulk and with the pattern of entrances and fenestration of neighboring buildings  shield light spill from windows where the terrain does not provide it landscaping shall be used to screen and diffuse the light emanating from large banks of windows compliance with this standard is especially important for proposed buildings on slopes for the application of this standard in the gzds see wdb 5 225 architectural design roofs  use pitched roofs pitched roofs are preferred over flat but it is acknowledged that a flat roof may be most practical for some types of building especially in the izdw pitched roofs are required wherever a height incentive is claimed under wdb   or  adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 2  | 4  consider sliding ice and snow building entrances see wdb 1 parking areas and pedestrian ways must be protected from ice and snow sliding off roofs this may be accomplished by a roof plan that directs ice and snow away from these areas andor by structural protection  use compatible colors forms and materials roof colors forms and materials should be compatible with the colors detailing and materials used on the building and on neighboring buildings variations in roof form should reflect the buildings function reinforce the architectural detailing for example roof form could be used to help mark entrances as required by wdb 1 and not be overly complicated  hide roof drains roof drains must be integrated into the design of the facade on which they are mounted not added as an afterthought  consider the view from above there are a few places in willistons design review district where a roof may be viewed from above new development in those places must provide a rendering of the view of the roof in its application for a discretionary permit and the drb may require modifications of the plans submitted switching from roofmounted to groundmounted mechanical equipment for example to minimize the impact on the view 226 mixed use buildings willistons town plan encourages mixeduse development with the goal of making it possible for people to live near commercial services and places of employment there is however a higher potential for conflict among uses are mixed and especially where they are mixed in the same building  what must mixeduse developments do to ensure compatibility first the plans submitted for a proposed mixeduse development must clearly demonstrate compliance with the standards adopted in this chapter in particular the applicant should anticipate the need for soundproofing and show how that has been provided in compliance with of this bylaw  are there additional standards for buildings that house both residential and commercial uses yes 1 entrances  different uses may share an entrance but the principal entrances to the dwellings shall not pass directly by solid waste containers or other equipment or installations that must be screened or located away from neighboring uses as required by of this bylaw  the principal entrance to the dwellings should be frompedestrianscale space not directly from a parking lot that is also used for commercial purposes this could mean entry from a pedestrianfriendly commercial streetscape or entry via a private courtyard or similar space 2 hours of operation  as provided in of this bylaw the drb may impose limits on the hours of operation of businesses in mixeduse developments to help maintain use compatibility adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 2  | 5  the drb may also impose limits on the hours during which deliveries may be accepted andor trash collection may be scheduled 3 outdoor space residents of mixeduse buildings shall have reasonable access to an outdoor space this could be in the form of a private courtyard or door yard garden but can also be in the form of an urban or neighborhood park that is within a fiveminute walk 4 signs and lighting the location and design of signs and outdoor lighting is even more important than usual in mixeduse developments the drb may impose limits on signs and outdoor lighting that are more stringent than those established elsewhere in this bylaw to ensure use compatibility in mixeduse developments 5 soundproofing the drb will require applicants to demonstrate that nighttime interior sound levels in the residential portions of proposed mixeduse developments will not exceed 40 dbal10 6 views dwellings in proposed mixeduse buildings must be designed to provide their residents with views to the mountains nearby open spaces or attractive streetscapes designs that feature views primarily of rooftops parking areas or service spaces will be rejected 227 outdoor lighting of this bylaw regulates the intensity and type of outdoor illumination that may be provided beyond those standards design review will consider the choice of luminaires pole pole bases and other elements of the outdoor lighting system which should complement and be compatible with the other design features of the building and the site 228 signs architectural and site design must anticipate the need for signs as required by of this bylaw 229 site planning the functional aspects of site planning are covered in other chapters of this bylaw and additional site design standards apply in many zoning districts  respect the terrain consistent with the watershed protection standards of the specific standards adopted in some districts buildings parking areas and other site improvements should fit the terrain rather than the land being fit to the building  build a strong street line as appropriate for the area buildings not parking areas should dominate streetscapes in the commercial and mixed use zoning districts while an ample green planting strip and buffer should be provided in the industrial zoning districts  leave front yards open front yard along the street fencing is generally not permitted for commercial industrial institutional or multifamily developments the drb may allow an exception to this standard for industrial developments where it finds that the presence of hazards or need for security outweigh the aesthetic value of an open streetscape  fencing and screening where fencing is provided it shall be of a type that is compatible with the surrounding landscape and uses traditional fencing patterns like stone walls or picket fences will be preferred the drb may permit security fencing of side and back yards where it is necessary to prevent public access adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 3  | 1 landscaping this chapter provides performance standards for the landscaping of all development for which a discretionary permit is required including higher density residential mixeduse commercial industrial and institutional developments these standards seek to  protect functional existing vegetation as development occurs   protect water quality by integrating landscaping with measures to control stormwater runoff and erosion   limit runoff and allow for groundwater and wetlands recharge by maintaining vegetated spaces in developing areas   protect urban wildlife habitat by requiring species diversity and vertical structure in most landscaped spaces   ensure land use compatibility by requiring effective landscaped buffers between potentially incompatible uses   create favorable microclimates and reduce energy consumption in developed spaces   complement other requirements of this bylaw including the requirements for erosion and runoff control watershed protection buffers the provision of neighborhood parks the provision of trails  and site maintenance  and  maintain and enhance the appearance and character of individual developments and the community 231 applicability  landscape plans  do these standards apply to my project these standards apply to all development for which a permit is required  how do these requirements interact with other requirements of this bylaw virtually every development in williston is required to provide open space some of that open space must be left in its existing condition and some of it must be landscaped as required by this chapter both types of requirements may apply to the same development areas in which existing vegetation generally must be retained are listed below this chapter applies to all other open areas including landscaped buffers and setbacks 1 open fields and meadows the annual mowing of open field and meadows may be required by the drb to preserve scenic views where mowing is required the drb may impose a requirement that mowing take place after june 15 in order to protect nesting birds 2 open space development adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 3  | 2  residential subdivisions in the arzd are generally there is an exception for parcels under 105 acres required to provide substantial open space not all of which will necessarily falls into one of the other categories listed here this required open space is generally to be left in the existing vegetation but certain exceptions may be required or permitted by which may also require the enhancement of existing vegetation  residential subdivisions in the rzd and vzd may be required to provide substantial open space not all of which will necessarily fall into one of the other categories listed here this required open space is generally to be left in the existing vegetation but certain exceptions may be permitted by the drb 3 watershed protection existing riparian and wetlands vegetation is to be retained within the watershed protection buffers required by of this bylaw 4 wildlife habitat existing vegetation is to be retained in habitat conservation areas that are protected from development 5 woodland and forest existing woodland and forest vegetation must be retained outside any clearing limits imposed by the drb 6 forest management none of the above preclude pruning thinning or the selective harvest of trees in accordance with a forest management plan  must i submit a landscaping plan yes all applications for a discretionary permit must be accompanied by a landscaping plan the required contents of which are listed in the landscaping plan checklist this requirement does not apply to proposed developments in which no new landscaping is required by this or other chapters of

landscape buffer requirement diagram 232 existing vegetation  can i clear an entire site of existing vegetation the clearing of an entire site of more than onehalf 12 acre at one time is a violation of this bylaw subject to enforcement as provided by wdb 7476 vegetation must be removed from larger sites in phases this may eventually lead to removal of vegetation from an entire site but note that wdb  requires functional existing vegetation to be retained wherever possible  can i replace all existing vegetation existing vegetation that can effectively serve the landscaping functions listed in the introduction to this chapter shall be retained to the extent possible while accommodating the permitted level of development an application for a permit may be rejected solely on the grounds that it fails to retain existing vegetation where that vegetation can fulfill the functions listed in the introduction to this chapter  must i protect existing vegetation during construction yes existing vegetation that is to be retained must be protected from damage during construction as required by the public works standards the landscaping plan must include a schedule showing that all measures required to protect existing vegetation will be put in place before other construction activities begin this schedule may apply to the entire site or to sequential phases of construction 233 landscaped buffers  must a development provide landscaped buffers for adjoining uses table 23a shows where landscaped buffers are required it also summarizes the principal standards for the design of those buffers which are set forth in detail below  how wide must the required landscaped buffers be table 23a establishes a minimum width for landscaped buffers of different types in different situations this minimum width may in some cases be reduced by the inclusion of an earthen berm or screening fence as provided by wdb  the types of landscaped buffers are described below the landscaping plan must adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 3  | 4 show the dimensions of the proposed buffers including all crossings and inclusions  a planting design and schedule appropriate for the proposed buffer type  and one or more typical crosssections plant selection is subject to the requirements of wdb 237 1 watershed protection buffers a watershed protection buffer required by may be used as a landscaped buffer required by table 23a where the watershed protection buffer consists primarily of marsh or open water it shall be supplemented by a type iii or iv landscaped buffer whichever is most appropriate to the context of at least eight 8 feet in width drb discretion context simply means the surroundings determining what type of landscaped buffer will be appropriate in a particular context is an important exercise of discretion for the drb with the advice of the advisory boards the drb and the advisory boards also have the discretion to determine whether or not a berm andor a screening fence are needed in a landscaped buffer and to review the design of berms and fences 2 type i  existing vegetation a landscaped buffer composed primarily of existing woodland or forest that must be of sufficient height and density to provide an effective visual buffer where this type of buffer is proposed the landscaping plan shall include photographic documentation of the buffers effectiveness the landscaping plan shall also propose supplemental new plantings where the existing vegetation is too thin to be an effective visual buffer this type of buffer must be relatively wide to sustain its habitat value and to function as a woodland or forest that needs only minimal maintenance other types of buffers may be narrower but are assumed to require regular maintenance 3 type ii  dense plantings a type ii landscaped buffer must be composed primarily of continuous dense screening vegetation that will grow to at least six 6 feet in height the screening vegetation or hedge must be supplemented on the exterior side by a type iii or iv landscaped buffer whichever is most appropriate to the context of at least 8 feet in width this type of buffer is most appropriate in redevelopment projects where space is limited the buffer width reduction provided for in wdb  shall be given where the drb requires a berm or fence 4 type iii  informal plantings a type iii landscaped buffer must be composed of a planted area that includes a ground cover a partial understory of shrubs and small trees and major trees the minimum density of planting per 100 feet of buffer shall be a full ground cover two major trees three ornamental or understory trees and any combination of shrubbery or flower beds that occupies at least 50% of the area at the time of planting this type of buffer can be used in many circumstances the drb may require an earthen berm a screening fence or wall andor additional plant materials where the uses being separated are substantially different in intensity the buffer width reduction provided for in wdb  shall be given where the drb requires a berm or fence 5 type iv  formal plantings a type iv landscaped buffer is a parklike landscaped area that includes a ground cover of turf and major trees it may also include ornamental trees shrubs flowers and planters plantings are usually evenly distributed although an artistic departure from pattern may be permitted the minimum density of planting per 100 feet of buffer shall be a full ground cover of turf and three major trees this type of buffer is most appropriate between uses of similar intensity or along public ways it does not include a berm or a fence adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 3  | 5  will screening berms or fences be required can a screening berm or fence be used to reduce the width of a required buffer in some cases 1 earthen berms an earthen berm may be required to increase the effectiveness of a landscaped buffer for outdoor storage andor work areas including areas where trucks or heavy machinery will be parked the landscaping plan shall show the contours of the proposed berm and one or more crosssections detailing its construction the required buffer width may be reduced by the height of the berm but not by more than 25%  berms should not ordinarily be more than six feet in height the drb may however permit a higher berm where physical characteristics of the site like grade changes warrant it  no berm shall have a slope greater than  except where a retaining wall is used  retaining walls shall be constructed of or faced with timber native or cast stone or masonry that matches or complements buildings on the site  retaining walls should ordinarily face inward away from public ways the drb may however permit an exception where an outwardfacing retaining wall results in less grading  plans calling for retaining walls that are four feet or more in height shall be accompanied by engineering specifications demonstrating that the proposed retaining walls are capable of bearing the anticipated load 2 screening fences an opaque fence may be required to increase the effectiveness of a landscaped buffer for outdoor storage andor work areas including areas where trucks or heavy machinery will be parked the landscaping plan shall show the location of the screening fence and provide one or more elevations detailing its construction the buffers width may be reduced by the height of the fence but not by more than 25% the height and design of a screening fence is subject to design review and approval by the drb fence materials patterns and colors should match or complement the materials architectural details and colors used on buildings on the site  are any impervious surfaces permitted in landscaped buffers yes 1 crossings landscaped buffers may be crossed by driveways roads sidewalks trails and utility lines including necessary risers and boxes serving the development the width of these crossings will necessarily vary with the scale and nature of the development but should be minimized 2 sidewalkstrails sidewalks and trails may run within and parallel to a landscaped buffer the width of the sidewalk or trail shall not however be counted as part of the width of the buffer 3 light standards the bases of standards for approved outdoor lighting may be placed in a landscaped buffer adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 3  | 6 4 miscellaneous the base of a permitted freestanding or directional sign may be placed in a landscaped buffer landscaped buffers may also include retaining walls planters minor impervious surfaces that are part of runoff and erosion control works  and sculptures or other works of art  do landscaped buffer requirements eliminate setback requirements where they are required they eliminate side and rear setbacks but do not eliminate front setbacks landscaped buffers replace rear and side yard requirements for uses other than one and two family dwellings front setback requirements vary with the type of street and may be found in the chapters establishing the individual zoning districts  should landscaped buffers be used as part of developments stormwater management system required landscaped buffers must function as part of the developments stormwater management system wherever feasible see wdb 295 and other provisions of of this bylaw concerning the role of vegetation in stormwater management 234 landscaped screening utility installations mechanical equipment solid waste containers and the like must be fully screened from view from neighboring properties and public ways  how should screening be provided screening for utility installations mechanical equipment solid waste containers and the like must include a dense evergreen hedge and other plant materials that are at least five 5 feet deep the drb may permit an exception to this standard where space constraints prevent provision of an adequate hedge where such an exception is made screening must be accomplished using a fence or wall that complies with wdb   will more screening ever be required possibly the drb may require that a berm fence or wall be used supplement the landscaped screening fence or wall materials patterns and colors

energyefficient light sources  and to reduce the waste of light and glare from overlighting and poorly shielded or inappropriately directed lighting fixtures lighting terminology a fixture is the assembly that houses a lamp or lamps it may include mounting brackets  a ballast  lamp socket  a reflector mirror or refractor  lens andor a shield a lamp is the component of a luminaire that produces the actual light one example is an incandescent light bulb a luminaire is a complete lighting system including the lamp or lamps and fixture a lumen is a unit used to measure the amount of light emitted by lamps for example a basic 60watt incandescent bulb and a 15watt compact florescent bulb both emit approximately 900 lumens when new for the purposes of this bylaw the lumen output shall be the initial lumen output of a lamp as rated by the manufacturer a footcandle is a unit of light intensity equal to one lumen per square foot footcandles can be measured using a light meter unless otherwise specified in this bylaw footcandles shall be measured horizontally at grade level a pole is a more or less vertical support that holds a luminaire at a specified mounting height 242 applicability  does my outdoor lighting have to meet the requirements of this chapter yes unless it is specifically exempted by wdb  new and replacement outdoor lighting must comply with the standards of this chapter + fixture   lamp luminaire adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 4  | 2  do i have to get a permit to install outdoor lighting an administrative permit is required to install outdoor lighting that is not exempted by wdb  the installation of outdoor lighting without a permit is a violation of this bylaw subject to enforcement as provided by wdb 7476 outdoor lighting must also be shown on applications for discretionary permits as required by wdb 243  are there types of outdoor lighting for which no permit is required yes 1 emergency lighting no permit is required for temporary emergency lighting used by the fire police and public works departments or other emergency service agencies 2 residential lighting no permit is required for outdoor lights that are installed at one and two family dwellings and that are rated at 1200 initial lumens or less per lamp as long as the maximum lumen output per dwelling set by table 24a 5500 initial lumens is not exceeded floodlights rated less than 1200 initial lumens are included in this exception  however all floodlights must adhere to the installation guidelines of wdb  what does 1200 initial lumens actually mean 1200 lumens initial output is approximately equivalent to one 75watt incandescent bulb or one 20watt compact fluorescent bulb 3 holiday lighting temporary seasonal holiday lighting is not subject to review or compliance with this chapter if and only if the following conditions are met  seasonal holiday lighting must not constitute a traffic hazard or a nuisance to neighboring properties  seasonal holiday lighting may be displayed for no more than 60 days  are some types of outdoor lighting prohibited yes 1 uplighting lighting directed upwards above horizontal to illuminate flags buildings signs or landscaping is prohibited the only exception to this standard is that one us flag per parcel may be uplit with luminaires of less than 2500 lumens total all lamps 2 laser and search lights lasersource lights and search lights sweeping or stationary are prohibited for all but emergency purposes 3 moving lights flashing flickering moving or otherwise animated lighting other than seasonal holiday lighting meeting the requirements of wdb 3 is prohibited 4 mercury vapor the use of mercury vapor lighting is prohibited 5 bands of light lighting fixtures containing lighting elements that form a band of light are not allowed the use of internally illuminated bands of color andor light on building exteriors is prohibited  must existing outdoor lighting be brought into compliance when i apply for a permit yes existing outdoor lighting that does not comply with the standards established in this chapter has a right to continue as a nonconforming use as provided by wdb 28 however the drb may condition approval of a permit required by this bylaw on the removal of nonconforming outdoor lighting adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 4  | 3 243 lighting plans  what must be submitted with my discretionary permit administrative permit or sign permit application in order to approve my outdoor lighting the lighting plans called for by the discretionary permit checklist must include a lighting plan that presents the information listed here applications for administrative permits including sign permits that propose outdoor lighting must include as much of the information listed here as is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the standards of this chapter 1 lighting levels all applications must show the total lumens per acre or lumens per dwelling in all areas that will be illuminated including both existing and proposed outdoor lighting lighting plans that are part of applications for discretionary permits must include a pointbypoint analysis of anticipated illumination levels in all areas that would be illuminated this lighting grid must be based on the proposed luminaires and their mounting heights the proposed maximum minimum and average illumination levels and uniformity ratios shall be calculated for each area proposed to be illuminated 2 lighting locations the lighting plan must outline the areas to be illuminated thus documenting the basis of the calculations called for by wdb 1 and show the locations and mounting heights of all proposed luminaires 3 lighting specifications the lighting plan include the manufacturers specifications for all proposed luminaires there must be sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the standards of this chapter including shielding details and initial lumen outputs  may the administrator refer lighting plans that accompany applications for administrative permits to the haac for review yes where the proposed lighting has not been reviewed as part of an application for a discretionary permit the administrator may refer that proposed lighting to the haac for a review of its impacts on neighboring properties public ways and the night sky before taking action on the application for an administrative permit 244 lamp and fixture types  shielding  what types of lamps are allowed for outdoor lighting in williston the types of lamp allowed include incandescent compact fluorescent metal halide lightemitting diode led and high and low pressure sodium as per wdb 4 the use of mercury vapor lamps is prohibited the use of other types of lamps may be approved by the drb where it finds that they will comply with the standards established in this chapter  what types of lighting fixtures are allowed except where specifically exempted in this bylaw all lighting fixtures must be fully shielded this means that the fixture is constructed so that all the light emitted by the lamp including indirect reflection off reflectors is projected below horizontal only low lumen lighting less than 1200 lumens per lamp may be unshielded and table 24a sets a stringent limit on the total amount of light that can be generated by unshielded fixtures where can i find fully shielded lighting fixtures the international darksky association wwwdarkskyorg maintains lists of manufacturers and distributors of fullyshielded lighting fixtures adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 4  | 4 245 lighting zones and cumulative light output  are there different lighting standards for different parts of williston yes this chapter establishes somewhat different lighting standards for each of the four lighting zones listed below 1 lighting zoning 1 which consists of the agriculturalrural zoning district arzd  2 lighting zone 2 which consists of the residential zoning district rzd  3 lighting zone 3 which consists of the village zoning district vzd  and 4 lighting zone 4  which encompasses all other zoning districts established in this bylaw  are there limits on the total amount of outdoor light any one parcel can generate yes maximum light outputs as measured in initial lumens per acre of surface to be lit or lumens per residential unit are specified in table 24a 1 nonresidential all nonresidential uses of lighting must adhere to the

establishes specific requirements for those types of lighting  are there limits to how long my outdoor lights can be on yes this is another way of limiting light output unless otherwise specified in this bylaw  the hours of illumination for some specific adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 4  | 5 uses are addressed in wdb 247  businesses must turn off outdoor lights including those illuminating signs within one half hour after the close of business or pm whichever is later outdoor lights may be turned on one half hour prior to opening there are some exceptions to this standard 1 event lighting recreational or social events requiring outdoor lighting may utilize exterior lighting during the event or activity but it must be turned off after the event ends 2 motionactivated lighting motionactivated lighting is allowed to be on at all times provided the lights are programmed to turn off no more than five 5 minutes following the last detectable motion 246 luminaire orientation and mounting height  are there limitations on how and where i can place or orient outdoor lighting on my property yes 1 shielding must be maintained luminaires must be installed so that the full shielding of the fixture is maintained a fixture cannot be angled so that light is directed above horizontal 2 interior orientation is required light from outdoor luminaires may not be directed beyond the parcel boundaries onto adjacent properties or public ways  floodlights floodlights or spot lamps must be aimed no higher than 45 degrees above straight down half way between straight down and straight to the side floodlight lamps may not be directly visible from adjacent parcels or public ways  are there limitations on the mounting height of outdoor lighting yes the mounting height of outdoor lighting fixtures may not exceed 25 feet above finished grade except outdoor lighting fixtures mounted on the faade of buildings described in wdb  may not exceed 15 feet above finished grade from which the drb may allow an exception to this standard where the pole and luminaire assemblies are more than 250 from the nearest parcel boundary even in the case of an exception  however no fixture may be mounted at a height greater than that of the tallest building on the site  the average illumination of ground level areas shall be measured horizontally at grade level and computed only over the area designated as being illuminated in the security plan average illumination shall not exceed maximums listed in table 3 for each lighting zone  the average illumination level of vertical surfaces shall be measured at a height of 5 feet above grade and computed over the area of surface designated to be illuminated in the security plan average illumination shall not exceed maximums listed in table 3 for each lighting zone 247 specific outdoor lighting standards  are there specific standards for the lighting of convenience store and gas station canopies yes 1 lighting level areas around pump islands and under canopies shall be illuminated so that the minimum light level at finished grade is at least 10 footcandle but no more than 55 footcandles areas on the apron away from the canopy shall be considered parking lots adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 4  | 6 and must meet the

should provide motion sensitive canopy andor pump island lighting that does not exceed 55 footcandles while otherwise maintaining the same light level as a parking lot after business hours see wdb 4  are there specific standards for the lighting of outdoor recreational facilities yes a variety of outdoor recreation facilities may be illuminated to allow nighttime use including tennis courts ball fields driving ranges swimming pools outdoor skating rinks and ski areas the regulations in this section are intended to allow the necessary illumination of such facilities while minimizing adverse impacts such as glare skyglow and light trespass on nearby properties 1 lighting levels the lighting plan for an outdoor recreation facility must demonstrate that only the minimum level of illumination required for the proposed activity or activities will be provided the drb may independently determine the minimum illumination level required for any activity and impose that level as a condition of approval 2 internal orientation fixtures must be mounted and aimed so that their beams fall within the primary playing area and its immediate surroundings the visibility of light sources from nearby properties and public ways must be minimized no direct illumination may be aimed off the site 3 hours of illumination lights on outdoor recreational facilities shall be turned off except when the facilities are in use or being maintained  parking lot lighting parking lot lighting shall be designed to provide the minimum lighting necessary to ensure adequate vision and safety and to prevent glare or direct illumination onto adjacent properties or public ways 1 lighting levels illumination levels in parking areas must meet the requirements set forth for each lighting zone in table 24b parking areas in the arzd shall not be illuminated unless the drb finds that specific conditions exist which make that illumination necessary in such cases the lighting shall meet the standards for parking areas in the rzd adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 4  | 7 table 24b maximum average illumination and uniformity ratios required for parking each lighting zone  average illumination shall be measured horizontally at grade level computed over the area of the parking lot ^ uniformity ratio is a measure of the consistency of light levels across a given area it is expressed as maximum  minimum illumination levels 2 shielding all lighting serving parking lots must be fully shielded the drb may permit a limited exception to this standard in the vzd as provided by wdb 3 3 in the vzd alternatives to fully shielded lighting fixtures may be permitted in the vzd in order to accommodate fixtures of a particular period design or architectural style but those alternatives must comply with this standard  if alternative fixtures are not fully shielded the maximum initial lumens generated by each fixture shall not exceed 1200 equivalent to a 75watt incandescent bulb  the mounting height of such fixtures shall not exceed 20 feet 4 hours of illumination parking area illumination must be reduced by at least 75% within  hour of the close of the businesses the parking area serves this reduced lighting level can be achieved by turning off at least 75% of the parking lot lighting fixtures or by dimming lighting levels by 75% this standard does not require that lighting levels be reduced below 02 footcandles as measured horizontally at finished grade level  building faade lighting the lighting of building facades shall be designed to accentuate the architectural features of the building and the building entry or entries lighting fixtures must be located aimed and shielded so that the light is directed downward towards the ground and not onto adjacent roads sidewalks or properties lighting fixtures on building facades shall not be mounted at a height exceeding 15 feet above average finished grade  pedestrian ways the lighting standards for pedestrian ways will generally be the same as for parking lots the drb may however permit elevated lighting levels to highlight the entrances to buildings or particular pedestrian spaces the drb may also permit elevated lighting levels in areas like passenger loading areas where pedestrians and cars will be in close proximity  security lighting all night lighting for security surveillance will be minimized the use of motionactivated lights and alarms will be encouraged as an alternative all applications for discretionary permits that propose security lighting

list prohibited types of signs and an explanation of permit requirements including the requirement for master sign plans follows standards for the permitted type number size and illumination of permanent signs in each zoning district are presented in a table and wdb 256 and 257 wdb 258 addresses temporary signs the chapter ends with standards for continuing use of nonconforming signs and definitions of community information center and public art 251 purpose  principles authority  what role do signs play in willistons landscape williston permits signs that serve the public by identifying local businesses providing directions making people aware of regulations and possible safety hazards making people aware of community events and political messages and assisting town residents in the occasional sale or lease of homes and household goods what is a sign for the purposes of this bylaw a sign is anything that is intended to attract attention that is not specifically excluded from this definition this includes what people typically think of as signs ranging from small no parking signs to large billboards it also includes other attention getting devices or displays including vending machines that are visible from a public way  pennants and pinwheels that bear no message  and similar devices or displays community information centers and public art both of which are defined later in this chapter are excluded so are scoreboards installed as provided by wdb 178  what principles guide sign regulation in williston 1 signs are important signs that effectively serve the purposes listed above are an important feature of the towns landscape they help people navigate community and make people aware of local businesses homes for sale or rent the sale of household goods and community events they also help make people aware of regulations and safety hazards and provide a means of political expression 2 freedom of speech federal courts have made it clear that signs are a legitimate medium for political expression the owner of any sign which is otherwise allowed by these standards may substitute noncommercial copy in lieu of any other commercial or noncommercial copy the purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message this provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary 3 signs have impacts despite their importance in the towns life signs that are too numerous too large poorly placed improperly illuminated or out of scale or character with adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 5  | 2 their surroundings will seriously detract from willistons landscape and economy they can block or diminish scenic views obstruct views at driveways and intersections  distract motorists  block pedestrian ways  hide architectural or landscape details that contribute to the character of buildings neighborhoods and the town  create light trespass and pollution  and project a sense of clutter and haste that is not consistent with either a healthy economy or a healthy community life 4 a positive contribution welldesigned signs in the right locations can make a positive contribution to willistons landscape economy and community life compliance with these standards will ensure that they do so 5 location matters different types numbers and sizes of signs are appropriate in different parts of williston and the standards adopted here vary accordingly 6 signs require the same level of planning and design as buildings the need for signs must be anticipated at the beginning of every project a master sign plan is required for all developments that could have multiple occupancies whether a master sign plan is required or not all new buildings and major additions to existing buildings must be designed with a sign band or other definite locations for the placement of permitted signs an application for a discretionary permit is not complete if it fails to show how signs will be placed or posted placement of signs v design of signs to be clear wdb 6 does not require applicants to include a specific number type or size of signs or the design of individual signs in applications for discretionary permits it simply requires that the applicant show where signs may be placed on the site or on proposed buildings or additions the individual signs that fill those blanks will be separately permitted  under what authority does the town regulate signs 25 vsa  22917 gives vermont municipalities the authority to to regulate or prohibit the erection size structure contents and location of signs posters or displays on or above any public highway sidewalk lane or alleyway of the municipality and to regulate the use size structure contents and location of signs on private buildings or structures note also that signs are structures within the meaning of 25 vsa  441 which provides the general authority for local zoning 252 sign regulation by zoning district because signs must be consistent with the purpose of each zoning district the type number height and size of signs allowed varies among the districts see table 25a for specific requirements for signs in each zoning district signs in vzd must also comply with the williston village historic district design review guide wdb 256 provides an explanation of table 25a 253 prohibited signs some types of signs simply may not be placed or posted in williston those types of signs are listed below also any sign that does not comply with the standards established in this chapter with any other requirement of this bylaw or with an applicable approved master sign plan is prohibited the placement or posting of a prohibited sign is a violation of this bylaw subject to enforcement as provided in wdb 7476  are animated signs permitted no animated blinking flashing and moving signs or signs that appear to move are prohibited this includes any sign that interferes with imitates or resembles an official traffic control sign signal or device or attempts or appears

wdb 11 are exempt from this prohibition  are illuminated signs permitted illuminated signs are permitted in compliance with wdb  and of the bylaw but three types of illuminated signs are simply prohibited 1 beacons the use of spotlights searchlights beacons or similar lights that are projected toward the sky to attract attention is prohibited 2 glaring any sign with lighting that interferes with the safe operation of motor vehicles or bicycles or that unnecessarily trespasses on neighboring properties is prohibited 3 internally illuminated with the exception of the limited use of illuminated window signs internally illuminated signs are prohibited this prohibition includes led readerboard signs that are often used to display changeable copy like announcements and gasoline prices  are offpremises signs permitted an offpremise sign is a sign that advertises a commercial enterprise or event that is placed on a parcel of land that is not the same parcel where the enterprise or event is located offpremises signs are generally prohibited but there are three minor exceptions to this standard 1 directional signs offpremises directional signs may be permitted where a special event is permitted under the provisions of the special events described in appendix e 2 product advertising product advertising signs are offpremise signs and thus prohibited a limited exception for product advertising using temporary signs is provided by wdb 258 3 offpremise agricultural signs signs placed in in the arzd vzd and rzd advertising the sale of agricultural products in the arzd vzd and rzd while state law generally prohibits offsite signage 24 vsa 12 provides an exception as follows directional signs subject to regulations adopted by the federal highway administration with a total surface area not to exceed six square feet providing directions to places of business offering for sale agricultural products harvested or produced on the premises where the sale is taking place or to farmers markets that are members of the vermont farmers market association selling vermont agricultural products signs advertising farms farmstands and farmers markets that are members of the vermont farmers market association and that are located in the rzd vzd and arzd may be placed offpremise only in the arzd vzd and rzd under the following conditions  only one

may permit an exception to this prohibition for signs mounted on the sloping sides of gambrel or mansard roofs where such an exception is allowed the resulting signs will be treated as wall signs and as part of the developments overall sign area what is the roofline for the purposes of sign regulation this bylaw defines the roofline as the lowest point defined by the eaves or where there are no eaves or similar overhangs the top of the wall  may i hang a sign on a tree no signs may not be painted on or attached to cliffs boulders trees or any other naturally occurring feature of the landscape the administrator may however permit an exception to this standard for building numbers andor home business signs when no reasonable alternative exists or the placement of a freestanding

i use a parked vehicle to advertise my business the use of an unregistered vehicle or trailer as a sign is prohibited the use of signs affixed to registered vehicles or trailers is also prohibited this prohibition is not intended prevent a business from painting vehicles that are routinely used in the conduct of that business but the administrator may require that existing parking areas where such vehicles are routinely parked be brought into compliance with the landscaped buffer requirements for parking areas that are adopted in this bylaw  unsafe signs the following types of signs are unsafe by definition and constitute a violation of this bylaw that must be removed upon receipt of a notice of violation sent under the authority of wdb 74 adopted by the selectboard  amended

placing portable sign approved in compliance with wdb 3 5 any sign that is determined to be structurally unsound or to present a hazard of electrical shock will also be considered unsafe and subject to immediate repair or removal the administrator will use the most recent edition of the uniform or international sign the basis for the enforcement of this standard 254 permit requirements for signs  is a permit required for a sign usually but it depends on the type of sign wdb  exempts some types of signs from the need for a permit but not from compliance with this bylaw an administrative permit is required for the placement or posting of all other signs  is there a special application form for sign permits yes applicants must use the sign permit application and sign permit checklist provided by the town in preparing their applications  is there a fee for the placement or posting of a sign the application fee set by the selectboard must accompany all applications for permits for signs  what type of signs may be placed or posted without a permit no review is required for the placement or posting of nonilluminated signs of the types listed below or for the routine maintenance and repair of existing signs this exemption from the requirement for a permit does not however exempt any sign from compliance with all other requirements of this chapter and this bylaw exempt signs do not count as part of the total number or area of signs permitted by this chapter 1 building numbers no permit is required for building numbers required by willistons road name and road location numbering relevant portions of that ordinance appear as appendix f of this bylaw the placement of building numbers must comply with the standards set by table 25a 2 changes in copy no permit is

wildlife of williston and surrounding communities this shall include 1 core habitat  and 2 wildlife connectivity corridors  what is core habitat a combination of several different wildlife habitat types combined to form a unit of relatively continuous wildlife habitat areas characterized as core habitat generally consist of relatively large forested areas that might contain a combination of early succession habitats  forested riparian areas  wetlands and vernal pools  deer wintering areas ie deeryards  mast stands  ledge talus or cliff habitats  and habitat identified by the vermont department of fish and wildlife as either significant wildlife habitat or necessary wildlife habitat in accordance with 10 vsa a8a  what is a wildlife connectivity corridor a route that permits the direct travel or spread of animals or plants from one area or region to another either by the gradual spread of a species population along the route or by the movement of individual members of the species generally such areas are characterized by undeveloped forested and riparian corridors including forest cover reaching to road rightsofway which serve to link large tracks of unfragmented core habitat in williston the corridor was designed to accommodate bobcat fisher mink fourtoed salamander wood frog smooth green snake and wood turtle  what are the boundaries of the swhas the boundaries of swhas are shown on the official map titled significant wildlife habitat areas which is available for review at the williston planning and zoning office adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 7  | 3  what is the purpose of protecting significant wildlife habitat areas this section establishes development standards designed to guide development in a manner that maintains large blocks of forest and areas of contiguous habitat  protect distinct types of habitat required for specific wildlife species  and ensure the continued movement of wildlife species between unfragmented blocks of forest and core habitat within the town and surrounding region  what uses are exempted from these standards site work structures andor impervious surfaces shall not encroach upon designated swhas except 1 expansion of existing structures the expansion of an existing structure provided that the expansion or the cumulative total of multiple expansions does not exceed a total footprint of 100% of the footprint of the existing structure 2 accessory structures accessory structures to an existing permitted structure or use shall be permitted within 150 feet of such existing permitted structure or use or placed on existing maintained lawns or impervious surfaces or within building envelopes and roads and driveways whichever is greater 3

assessment of the likely impact of the proposed development including associated activities eg introduction of domestic pets operation of vehicles and equipment exterior lighting introduction of nonnative species for landscaping on the ecological function of the significant wildlife habitat found on the site this shall include an assessment of whether travel between areas of core habitat will be disrupted  and  recommendations specific measures that would avoid or minimize the proposed developments impact on the habitat including alternative site designs considered for the project alternative locations for the development on the parcel and possible mitigation  swha general standards all development within swhas shall be designed to 1 minimize the fragmentation of forest cover and other relevant habitat characteristics all development in swhas shall be designed so that lots and building sites are located to avoid to the greatest extent practicable given site conditions and development options on the site impacts to significant wildlife habitat therefore if a site on a parcel is capable of meeting all the standards of this section then that site will be given precedence

practical given development options for the site to avoid encroachment into core habitat  habitat connectivity corridor standards all development within an area identified as a habitat connectivity corridor shall be designed to 1 minimize disruption and fragmentation of the identified corridor ensure that the development will not prevent the continued use by wildlife species identified as being dependent on the corridor bobcat fisher mink fourtoed salamander wood frog smooth green snake and wood turtle to travel between areas of core habitat 2 avoid barriers avoid any placement of fences walls or substantial changes in grade that would disrupt the movement of wildlife within the corridor 3 mitigate impacts if the requirements of 1 cannot be met then the applicant shall mitigate impacts by restoring or enhancing woody vegetation cover in portions of the mapped corridor that have been previously disturbed by clearing or similar disturbance restoration and enhancement proposals must be approved by the administrator and the restored or enhanced acreage must be included in a designated open space area as described in  276 uncommon rare threatened and endangered species urtes

or fewer steep declines or other factors rare species face threats from development of their habitat harassment collection and suppression of natural processes such as fire  what are threatened and endangered species endangered and threatened species are defined by both state and federal law state law defines endangered species as a species listed on the state endangered species list under 10 vsa section 5401 or determined to be an endangered species under the federal endangered species act the term generally refers to species whose continued existence as a viable component of the states wild fauna or flora is in jeopardy threatened species are defined in 10 vsa chap 123 section 5402 as a species whose numbers are significantly declining because of loss of habitat or human disturbance and unless protected will become an endangered species  are urtes located on my property known locations of urtes are shown on the official map titled uncommon rare threatened and endangered species

received a lesa farmland score are farmlands of local importance the lesa system is a framework for combining multiple factors into an integrated assessment of the importance of a particular site for continued agricultural use such factors as soil quality agricultural productivity development pressure and measures of other public values are combined into a single score that allows the town to identify and protect important agricultural land and plan growth accordingly  is my property considered a farmland of local importance farmlands of local importance are shown on the official map titled 1988 lesa farmland which is available for review at the williston planning and zoning office  what is the purpose of protecting important farmlands williston has lost a sizeable area of productive farmland to development the purpose is to preserve to the greatest extent practicable the working landscapes support locally grown products and that many residents and visitors see as the classic image of vermont  what uses are exempted from these standards site work structures andor impervious surfaces shall not encroach upon designated farmlands of local importance except the state of vermont uses a definition of agricultural lands that is based solely in the important farmlands definitions adopted by the natural resources conservation service see 10 vsa  600115 those definitions which include prime farmland and farmlands of statewide importance reflect the inherent characteristics and management of a parcel but ignore its context their use in williston has been counterproductive making it more difficult to promote a compact pattern of development because the state is protecting isolated parcels of productive soils that are surrounded by development and urban infrastructure williston focuses its farmland protection efforts on working farms which may include soils that are not as productive rather than on soil bodies adopted by the selectboard  amended

encroachment and associated fragmentation of important farmlands 279 scenic viewshed  what is a scenic viewshed willistons scenic viewshed includes the open fields and meadows wooded slopes and ridgelines and scenic viewpoints that make up the visual character of the town each viewshed category is described below these categories are further broken down into primary and secondary designations places where different components overlap are judged to be more significant  vantage point it is via accessible vantage points that a typical citizen takes in visual information about the landscape for most people these vantage points are found largely along the public roads daily travelled vantage points are public viewing points from roads and other places throughout town that provide access to views of high quality the lands comprising these views have been analyzed and evaluated with respect to four major components foreground middleground background and focal points  foreground these lands generally consisting of cleared land adjacent to public roads serve essentially as the communitys window into the landscape since they provide access to the rest of the landscape they are the most important component of a scenic landscape without them even the best middleground or background is lost to the viewer they are most effective when they are framed by a woodland or hedgerow edge that creates a distinct first layer of a multilayered view in certain high quality shortrange views they can also consist of wooded land yet because they tend to be visually uncluttered prominent and easily accessed they also are highly vulnerable to degradation by development adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 7  | 9  middleground these lands are generally a more complex composition of layered wooded and open lands and manmade features because of their inherent complexity they are able to absorb only limited and wellsited development without damaging their basic character middlegrounds often are important in the visual transition between foreground and background  background these lands now predominantly consist of forested hillsides that rise up behind the middleground to the east and west the far horizon lines are the green mountains and the adirondacks seen from many vantage points in the town with discretionary clearing of building sites hillsides below the horizon may sometimes absorb a limited amount of development soils and slopes permitting without significant intrusion at other times any development irrevocably compromises the view the horizon line itself due to its highly contrasted nature is very sensitive to intrusion by manmade development publicly acceptable encroachments are generally limited to certain public structures such as church steeples and the rooflines of government buildings or the collective composition of a settlement  focal points most high quality views feature some kind of accent or focal point within the composition the focal point draws the eye these are typically provided by prominent manmade features such as farmstead clusters or church steeples or unique natural features such as rock outcroppings great trees or mountain peaks because the strength of focal points lie in their contrast to the surrounding landscape they need to be protected from competing elements ie adjacent buildings or trees should not obliterate a village church steeple  what are the boundaries of the scenic viewshed the boundaries of the scenic viewshed are shown on the official map titled visual assessment which is available for review at the williston planning and zoning office  what is the purpose of protecting the scenic viewshed the purpose is to maintain the visual character of williston  what uses are exempted from these standards site work structures andor impervious surfaces shall not encroach upon the designated scenic viewshed except 1 growth

impact a scenic viewshed for all development proposed within a scenic viewshed and which is not exempted by section  or wdb the impact to the viewshed shall be determined by the zoning administrator or the drb prior to discretionary permit or administrative permit review the administrator may request recommendations from the williston conservation commission adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 8  | 1 special flood hazard areas this chapter establishes standards for development in special flood hazard areas sfhas it should be understood that these standards have very limited applicability because the watershed protection buffers required by of this bylaw essentially prohibit new structures in sfhas these standards will apply primarily to existing nonconforming uses 281 authority  purpose  boundaries  what is the legal authority for regulation of special flood hazard areas these standards are adopted to effect the purposes of 10 vsa as specifically authorized by 24 vsa  4424  what is the purpose of these regulations for special flood hazard areas these standards for sfhas are adopted to  minimize and prevent the loss of life and property the disruption of commerce the impairment of the tax base and the extraordinary public expenditures and demands on public services that result from flooding and floodrelated hazards   ensure that the design and construction of development in sfhas are accomplished in a manner that minimizes or eliminates the potential for flood loss or damage to life and property  and  ensure that the state municipalities and individuals are eligible for federal flood insurance and other federal disaster recovery and hazard mitigation funds  what are the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas the sfhas include all lands within the town of williston identified as sfhas on the most current flood insurance maps and studies published by the department of homeland security dhs federal emergency management agency fema national flood insurance program nfip or its successor and as provided by the secretary of the vermont agency of natural resources pursuant to 10 vsa  these maps are adopted by reference as part of this bylaw  who determines if a property is located within a special flood hazard area the location of the boundary shall be determined by the administrator based upon the most current information provided by the nfip listed in wdb  2814 what if i believe my property has been incorrectly shown in a special flood hazard area a property owner who believes that their property

in the town hall annex at 7900 williston road 282 definitions specific to this is a special flood hazard area special flood hazard areas include the area of floodplain that is subject to a one percent 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year in some cases the nfip has determined base flood elevations for watercourses and further classified the sfha into areas of regulatory floodway and floodway fringe as described in wdb  and  in other cases the nfip has not yet classified the sfha  what is the regulatory floodway the regulatory floodway includes the channel of a river or stream and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood  the flood having a one percent 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in a given year  without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot at any point  what is the floodway fringe the floodway fringe is the area of sfha outside of the regulatory floodway in areas where the regulatory floodway has been designated 283 permits permit requirements are explained in chapters 46 of this bylaw all development within sfhas with the exception of accessory structures decks patios pools and improvements that do not constitute a substantial improvement of existing dwellings will require a discretionary permit before an administrative permit can be approved what is a substantial improvement a substantial improvement of an existing residential structure means any reconstruction rehabilitation addition or other improvement the cost of which over three years or improvements by way of a common plan of development equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the original structure before the start of construction  can an administrative permit be issued immediately once a discretionary permit has been approved or if no discretionary permit is necessary no 1 referral to state the town must submit a copy of the application for an administrative permit for development within an sfha to the regional floodplain manager at the vermont agency of natural resources in accordance with 24 vsa  4424 a permit may be issued only following the receipt of comments from the agency or the passage of 30 days from the date the application was mailed to the agency whichever comes first 2 other permits the administrator will not approve an administrative permit for development within an sfha before determining that any state andor federal permits which may be required have been issued 3 alteration or relocation of a watercourse applications for the alteration or relocation of watercourses must be referred to the state national floodplain insurance program coordinator at the vermont agency of natural resources as provided in wdb 1 and to the river management that same agency and to the army corps of engineers applicants must also notify any adjacent communities these referrals must be made at least 30 days before an administrative permit is approved see also wdb 285 adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 8  | 3  what records must be maintained when development is permitted in an sfha the administrator must maintain a separate record of all permits issued for development in sfhas including the elevation consistent with the datum of the elevation on the nfip maps for williston of the lowest floor including basements of all replacement or substantially improved buildings  the elevation consistent with the datum of the elevation on the nfip maps for williston to which buildings have been floodproofed  all floodproofing certifications required by these standards  and a record of all variances approved 284 standards  do the general standards of this bylaw apply to development in the sfhas yes development in sfhas must unless specifically exempted comply with all standards established in chapters 1329 in addition development in the sfha must comply with all standards specific to the underlying zoning district where the standards adopted in this chapter and other standards established by this bylaw differ the most restrictive standard applies  are there additional standards specific to sfhas yes they are presented in wdb 285 5 alteration of streams the alteration of watercourses is regulated by 10 vsa  102 et seq no administrative permit will be approved for development that involves the alteration of a stream until the applicant submits a copy of the approved permit from the vermont agency of natural resources for that alteration the flood carrying and sediment

for new construction substantial improvements encroachment or other development under this section must be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles and certified by a registered professional engineer 289 variances  enforcement  is it possible to obtain a variance from the requirements of this chapter yes though it is very unlikely in addition to meeting the requirements for variances detailed in wdb 81 variances may only be granted for development within an sfha if they meet the criteria found in 44 cfr any variances issued in the sfha shall not increase flood heights applicants should also be aware that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation increases the risk to life and property and will result in increased flood insurance premiums to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of coverage a copy of any variance obtained under this provision shall be affixed to the deed of the property on file in the towns land records  what will happen if i do not comply with this bylaw whenever development occurs contrary to the provisions of this bylaw enforcement shall proceed as provided by wdb 746 if development in an sfha is still not in compliance after the opportunity to correct the violation has passed the administrator shall in addition to taking any enforcement action authorized in submit a declaration to the administrator of the nfip requesting a denial of flood insurance of the national flood insurance act of 196 as amended authorizes fema to deny flood insurance to a property declared by a community to be in violation of their flood hazard area regulations the declaration shall consist of the name of the property owner and address or legal description of the property sufficient to confirm its identity or location  a clear an unequivocal declaration that the property is in violation this bylaw  a clear statement that the public body making the declaration has authority to do so and a citation to that authority  evidence that the property owner has been provided notice of the violation and the prospective denial of insurance  and a clear statement that the declaration is being submitted pursuant to of the national flood insurance act of 196 as amended 2810 disclaimer of liability this bylaw does not imply that land outside the mapped sfhas or any development permitted within an sfha will be free from flooding or flood damages nor does it create a liability on the part of the town or any town official or employee for any flood damages that result from reliance on

water quality and watershed health in williston by regulating construction site erosion and stormwater management in new developments and on redevelopment sites this chapter also establishes standards for the provision and protection of watershed protection buffers along streams and around wetlands and lakes 291 purpose  authority  what is the purpose of these standards in adopting these standards the selectboard makes the following findings  it is well documented that land development  which alters the volume velocity and quality of surface runoff  is likely to adversely affect nearby streams including the capacity and stability of their channels their physical and chemical characteristics and the health of the biological communities they support   federal law see 33 usc 1293d requires the state of vermont to maintain a list of streams that are impaired that is that do not fully support certain functions due to poor water quality   the allen brook willistons principal stream appears on that list because scientific surveys have shown it to be impaired for aquatic life support and contact recreation due to land development and the accompanying stormwater runoff and erosion   the muddy brook willistons natural boundary with south burlington also appears on vermonts list of impaired waters because it fails to provide aquatic life support due to a lack of riparian buffers land

developments and redevelopment sites  adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 9  | 2  while the town has actively worked on watershed health investments in stream restoration and the application of its regulations restoring the health of the allen brook preventing the addition of other local streams to the list of impaired waters and complying with the requirements imposed by the ms4 permit make it necessary to adopt these standards  under what authority does the town adopt these standards these standards are adopted under the authority of 24 vsa  44179 as noted in wdb  above their adoption is also specifically required by  and  of general permit 39014 as amended  as issued by vermont agency of natural resources department of environmental conservation 292 applicability  what activities are subject to these standards these standards apply to any development for which a permit is required by this bylaw  are there any exceptions from these standards as provided by wdb 2 accepted agricultural and forestry practices are exempt from the standards adopted in this chapter developments in which the total cumulative land disturbance including all clearing grading and excavation is less than  onequarter acre are exempt from the runoff and erosion control standards provided in sections wdb 293  296 in this chapter but are encouraged to monitor and minimize runoff and erosion taking whatever measures are needed to protect neighboring properties and water quality  what about small projects these standards recognize that the level of runoff and erosion control required to protect water quality varies with the size and location of the proposed development 1 low risk development wdb 293 sets relatively simple runoff and erosion control standards for smaller developments that pose a relatively low risk of accelerated runoff erosion and sedimentation 2 all other development wdb 294 establishes runoff and erosion control standards for larger developments and development in vulnerable areas  what about routine maintenance what about emergencies these standards do not apply to the routine maintenance of public and private roads or utilities including stormwater management works nor do they apply to emergency repairs required by flooding slope failures or other natural hazards or civil emergencies like a bridge failure it is understood however that runoff and erosion control measures will be incorporated into maintenance activities where necessary as part of the good housekeeping practices required by the towns ms4 permit 293 low risk development  what is a low risk development a low risk development is one in which the cumulative land disturbance is greater than  onequarter acre but less than two 2 acres in which all land that will be disturbed is outside the watershed protection buffers established by this chapter and in which all land that will be disturbed has a slope of less than eight percent 8%  what runoff and erosion control standards apply to low risk development adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 9  | 3 1 state handbook applications for permits for low risk developments shall be accompanied by a completed runoff and erosion control checklist that shows how the applicant will comply with the guidance provided in the current edition of vermonts low risk site handbook for erosion prevention and erosion control where can i find the low risk site handbook for erosion prevention and erosion control online at  dischargepermitssw_low_risk_site_handbookpdf 2 additional standards low risk developments must also comply with wdb  and 12 294 runoff and erosion control plans for other developments  when must a runoff and erosion control plan be submitted all applications for permits for developments that are not exempted by wdb 1 or defined as low risk by wdb  above shall be accompanied by a professionallyprepared runoff and erosion control plan that shows how compliance with the performance standards of wdb 295 will be attained both during the construction of the proposed development and the continuing use of the site  what must be included in a runoff and erosion control plan runoff and erosion control plans shall be based on a grading plan of the site and its immediate environs showing existing and proposed contours at intervals of no more than two feet and all information required by the erosion and runoff control plan checklist exception detailed contour mapping is not required for portions of a site that will not be disturbed but sufficient information must be provided to show how the transition from disturbed to undisturbed areas will be made  how will a proposed runoff and erosion control plan be reviewed the towns review of a proposed runoff and erosion control plan will begin with a meeting between the administrator and the dpw or their designees and the applicants designer this meeting will ordinarily be onsite if the application for a permit is approved there will also be a preconstruction meeting as required by wdb  295 runoff and erosion control standards because these performance standards recognize that there is a different solution for every site they sometimes use permissive terms like should the use of permissive terms does not constitute an exception to a performance standard it indicates only that the town is willing to review a variety of possible ways of achieving compliance  design to minimize runoff and erosion the proposed site plan should fit the site with the area to be disturbed cut and fill and impervious surfaces being minimized 1 avoid slopes development should be directed away from slopes this bylaw calls for reduced densities on slopes over 15% see the various zoning districts development is prohibited except where a variance can be justified on slopes of 30% or more 2 fit the terrain architectural forms and site improvements should fit the terrain access drives and roads parking and loading areas utility lines and the long axes of buildings should run more or less parallel to not more or less perpendicular to slopes where buildings adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 9  | 4 cross slopes floors should be staggered with the slope additional site planning and design standards designed to ensure that development fits the terrain are imposed in some zoning districts including the arzd gzdn gzds and rzd 3 phase construction the area disturbed at any one time shall be minimized in both time and space the runoff and erosion control plan shall show how clearing grading excavation and fill will be phased so that disturbance is promptly followed by revegetation andor structural stabilization of the site including temporary stabilization where areas will remain disturbed for more than 15 days a copy of the phasing schedule and a checklist on which the installation of measures by phases is recorded shall be maintained on the site for review by the town when inspections are made 4 minimize impervious surfaces the extent of paving and other impervious surfaces should be minimized by thoughtful site planning that keeps roads as narrow and as short as possible and that keeps surface parking areas small the use of porous pavements where site conditions permit is also strongly encouraged and may be required of uses that propose to place extensive parking areas in impaired watersheds  mark disturbance limits land disturbance clearing grading excavation and fill shall be confined within limits that are clearly marked on the site during construction disturbance limits must be shown on the runoff and erosion control plan then established in the field subject to inspection before any clearing grading excavation or fill begins disturbance limits must be marked with a fence or other barrier sufficiently durable to last anticipated construction period this fence or barrier should be supplemented with brightly colored flagging or tape work outside the approved disturbance limits is a violation of this bylaw subject to enforcement as provided by wdb 7476  hold a preconstruction meeting before any work for which a runoff and erosion control plan is required is begun the disturbance limits shall be marked on the site and the applicant shall arrange an onsite preconstruction meeting between the town staff and all design professionals contractors and subcontractors who will be responsible for the observance of those limits the purpose of this meeting shall be to review the runoff and erosion control plan for construction including the sequence and schedule for the installation of runoff and erosion control measures and the importance of maintaining those measures during the construction period  divert runoff from disturbed areas disturbed areas shall be protected from surface runoff by diversion dikes or channels silt barriers filter strips or other measures until they are revegetated or otherwise stabilized  stockpile and replace topsoil all topsoil removed shall be stockpiled and used in the revegetation of the site to put it another way the topsoil from the site shall be used there and not replaced with an inferior material 1 silt fence topsoil stockpiles shall be surrounded by a silt fence or an equally effective sediment control measure that also protects the stockpile from damage during construction activity 2 temporary cover topsoil stockpiles shall be stabilized with mulch that is renewed weekly or if the stockpile will not be worked for more than a week by a mulch followed by a temporary cover crop adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 9  | 5  protect retained vegetation existing vegetation that is to be retained must be protected from damage during construction as required here and in more detail by the public works standards the runoff and erosion control plan must include a schedule see the runoff and erosion control plan checklist showing that all measures required to protect existing vegetation will be put in place before other construction activities begin this schedule may apply to the entire site or to sequential phases of construction 1 earthwork within the dripline there should be no clearing grading excavation or other construction activity including the placement of underground utilities within the drip line of trees that are to be retained the administrator may permit minor exceptions to this standard where the terrain or the location of existing utilities andor buildings make compliance infeasible 2 storage within the dripline there shall be no storage or parking of construction equipment materials vehicles or waste on or around trees and roots or other vegetation that is to be retained this specifically prohibits the dumping of paint petroleum products concrete or stucco mix dirty water or any other material that may be deleterious to vegetation that is to be retained 3 use of trees the use of trees as a winch supports or anchorages as temporary power poles as sign posts or for other similar functions is prohibited 4 pruning trees and shrubs that are to be retained should be properly pruned before construction begins this will maximize their ability to withstand damage 5 porous pavement see wdb 4 above the use of porous pavements protects existing root systems  anticipate and limit accelerated runoff 1 channel design all filter strips swales grassed waterways other channels and outlets shall be designed and constructed to handle the anticipated increase in the volume and velocity of runoff without flooding or channel erosion 2 preconstruction

structures shall be integrated into the landscaping plan for a site contributing to the appearance and marketability of the proposed development and the community as well as to watershed protection 1 lower density development in lower density developments erosion and runoff control measures should blend in with the topography and vegetation of surrounding woods adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 9  | 6 and fields as much runoff retention and sediment trapping as possible shall occur on the surface or in shallow structures that mimic the vegetative composition and structure of natural wetlands and riparian areas 2 higher density development landscaped areas in higher density developments including those required by of this bylaw should also to the extent possible be used for stormwater management given the higher impervious coverage underground storage and mechanical treatment may also be used to comply with these performance standards  use appropriate plant materials proposed plant materials and planting mixes shall be suitable for the site and the intended application the requirements of wdb 237 apply to all plant materials specified in runoff and erosion control plans  maintain runoff and erosion control measures runoff and erosion control measures must be installed as designed and properly maintained failure to maintain the required measures is a violation of this bylaw subject to enforcement as provided by wdb 7476  schedule inspections during construction in order to ensure proper functioning and maintenance of required erosion and runoff control measures during the construction period the applicant shall provide for regular inspections of all runoff and erosion control measures by a qualified professional during the construction period an inspection and the repair or restoration of all measures is required after any precipitation event exceeding one inch reports on routine inspections shall be provided to the administrator and dpw within five working days after each inspection is made  winter construction it is best to avoid winter construction but williston recognizes that this is not always possible where it is not additional runoff and erosion control measures may be required these measures are established in the state handbooks that are adopted by reference in wdb   where can i find more specific guidance for complying with these performance standards 1 state handbook construction all construction site erosion control measures shall comply with the vermont handbook for soil

directly to a stormwater system only with the written permission of the dpw  must existing connections to stormwater systems be disconnected from stormwater systems whenever possible approval of any permit may be conditioned on the disconnection of existing footing foundation andor roof drains or sump pumps 298 wetlands protection  how will i know if i have wetlands on the site of my proposed development a wetlands delineation prepared by a professional wetlands scientist in accord with the current guidelines of the army corps of engineers must accompany all applications for discretionary permits for development on sites where wetlands are known or suspected to exist the need for a wetlands delineation will be determined during preapplication review what is a wetland wetlands are lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water for purposes of this classification wetlands must have one or more of the following three attributes 1 at least periodically the land supports predominantly hydrophytes  2 the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric soil  and 3 the substrate is nonsoil and is saturated with water or covered by shallow water at some time during the growing season of the year  are class ii wetlands protected in williston class ii wetlands are protected by state law and this bylaw they must generally remain in their natural vegetation but may be crossed by roads trail or utility lines where there is no feasible alternative to such a crossing and where all work is conducted in compliance with an approved runoff and erosion control plan and a conditional use permit approved by the agency of natural resources  are class iii wetlands protected in williston class iii wetlands generally are not protected by state law but may be protected by this bylaw and are definitely regulated by the army corps of engineers the drb may upon the recommendation of the conservation commission require that class iii wetlands with significant functional values remain in their natural vegetation the conservation commission may also recommend and the drb require that a functional assessment of the class iii wetlands on the proposed development site be provided along with the delineation wetlands classes state and federal wetland regulations there are no class

storage is not permitted in watershed protection buffers 5 lawn chemicals no lawn chemicals including fertilizers herbicides and pesticides may be used in watershed protection buffers the administrator may permit an exception to this standard for the control of invasive plants by or under the direction of a public agency this prohibition does not apply to accepted farm and forest practices which are exempt nor does it prohibit the use of compost or another organic fertilizer in conservation plantings 6 owners responsibilities the covenants for developments that include watershed protection buffers shall include a reference to the standards adopted here wdb  and in wdb  in developments where an owners association is required that association is responsible for the protection of the watershed protection buffers  how will people know where watershed protection buffers are watershed protection buffers must be marked on the ground as well as on the final plans this may be accomplished using plantings fences or other landscape features like a line of boulders the drb may permit an exception to this standard where a watershed protection buffer is marked by a definite change in the terrain  is it possible to obtain a variance to permit more development within a watershed protection buffer additional development within watershed protection buffers may be made possible by variance as provided by of this bylaw to approve such a variance the drb must make all of the findings required by wdb 1 and 2 as well as all findings required by wdb 81 adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 2 9  | 10 1 impervious cover the development permitted by variance will result in a total impervious cover of no more than 10

as provided by of this bylaw but only if all work complies with the standards established in this chapter exception no change in use that permits the processing manufacture storage or handling of regulated hazardous materials other potential pollutants or materials that could be dispersed downstream during a flood will be permitted 2910 source water protection areas  what is a source water protection area source water protection areas contribute or at least potentially contribute ground or surface water to drinking water supplies source water protection williston currently includes two source water protection areas one surrounds the well that serves the porterwood development on old creamery road the other is the watershed of lake iroquois which is part of the larger watershed of shelburne bay shelburne bay is the source for the champlain water district which supplies water to williston and other communities  what additional standards apply to development in source water areas

of the town of williston is available for review at the williston planning and zoning office the town makes every effort to provide accurate copies but questions about the exact location of a zoning district may be resolved only by reference to the official zoning map 302 zoning district boundaries  how do i know exactly where the zoning district boundaries are zoning district boundaries generally follow property lines as they were shown on the 20014 tax map but there are exceptions to this rule 1 streams where a zoning district boundary is shown along a stream that boundary follows the centerline of the stream unless otherwise clearly indicated by a note on the official zoning map zoning boundaries and the extent of the watershed protection buffers established by this bylaw shift as the course of the stream shifts 2 roads where a zoning district boundary is shown along a road that boundary follows the centerline of that road unless otherwise clearly indicated by a note on the official zoning map 3 utility lines where a zoning district boundary is shown along a power line or other utility easement or rightofway that boundary follows the centerline of that easement or rightofway unless otherwise clearly indicated by a note on the official zoning map 4 other boundaries notes on the official zoning map describe boundaries that do not follow a stream road utility line or property line 5 parcel merger if a property line that was also used as a zoning district boundary line on the official zoning map is eliminated by replatting the zoning district boundary line shall remain where it was  what if i disagree with the town about a zoning district boundary if there is a question about the location of a zoning district boundary the administrator will determine where the boundary is the administrators decision may be appealed to the drb using the procedure established in of this bylaw  is it possible to change a zoning district boundary yes but it is not a simple process the boundaries of willistons zoning districts are generally consistent with the future land use map adopted in the town plan this means that changing a zoning district boundary will usually require two amendments one to the town plan and one to the official zoning district map adopted in this chapter the process required to amend the official zoning map is explained in of this bylaw the process of amending a town plan is established by 24 vsa  4385 adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 3 0  | 2 303 about the zoning districts each zoning district chapter begins with the adoption of a boundary a statement of purposes and a list of permitted uses  how are uses defined and listed uses are listed by name and naics classification naics stands for the north american industrial classification system which is an allinclusive hierarchical system for describing economic activities naics classifications include as many as six digits for the finest level of detail but for most purposes of this bylaw less detailed classifications are adequate smaller classifications include all of the more detailed classifications that begin with the same numbers for example naics 11  agriculture forestry fishing and hunting  includes naics 111  crop production and naics 1111  soybean farming only those uses listed as permitted for each zoning district are allowed unless otherwise exempted  what types of standards apply in each zoning district four types of standards apply in the zoning districts created by this bylaw dimensional density general and specific dimensional standards help determine the location and size of development on a site density standards help determine the total extent of development on a site the general standards adopted in chapters 13 29 regulate access the provision of infrastructure outdoor lighting potential nuisances and many other aspects of development more specific standards are also adopted

implements the vision of willistons 2016 2024 town plan which begins williston will strive to balance responsible livable suburban growth with rural character and conservation to do this the town will  sustain rural landscapes by requiring an open space pattern for subdivisions conserving lands identified in the open space and working landscapes or easements  and finding ways to help the owners of working lands continue their stewardship  additional policy support for this zoning district is found at 32 of the town plan and in what uses are permitted in the arzd see table 31a and the notes below 1 focus on farming and forestry consistent with the purpose stated above and in the town plan the uses permitted in the arzd are limited to agriculture the production of forest products the

agriculture are also allowed as required by policy of the open space plan 2 defining agriculture and forestry agriculture and forestry include all accepted agricultural and forestry practices supporting uses like boarding stables farm stands sugar houses and the production of energy from agricultural wastes are also permitted the processing distribution and sale of products raised primarily on the farm or products fashioned primarily from timber harvested on the land is generally permitted but manufacturing and wholesale and retail trade are not accepted agricultural or

as a condition of approval  how much open space must be conserved all developments that involve more than 105 acres in this zoning district must protect at least 75% of their total area as open space the proposed protected open space must be clearly delineated on the concept plan submitted with the preapplication on all plans submitted with the application for a discretionary permit and on the approved final plan  must certain lands be included in the open space yes protected open space must meet the following requirements as applicable 1 watershed protection the protected open space must include all lands within the watershed protection buffers established by of this bylaw 2 conservation areas the protected open space must include all conservation areas identified in the open space plan to the extent consistent with the landowners right to adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 3 1  | 5 beneficial use of his or her property this means that if a landowner has only conservation areas or has no other lands physically suitable for development the conservation commission and the drb will work with that landowner to either effect a transfer of development rights as provided by of this bylaw or to create an open space development that minimizes consumption of lands that should be protected an alternative to development landowners whose holdings include conservation areas and other resources like productive farmland that are identified in the open space plan may find it more profitable to propose a sale of development rights to the town willistons environmental reserve fund and funding that is sometimes available from the vermont housing and conservation board may make it possible for a landowner to realize a reasonable return without enduring the development approval process or assuming the risks of becoming a developer 3 scenic viewsheds the protected open space should include scenic viewsheds that are identified in the open space plan or by the conservation commission it is acknowledged however that the mapping of scenic viewsheds is not precise it is also acknowledged that partial protection of a viewshed may be effective when combined with the design techniques that may be required for compliance with wdb 317 landowners who wish to develop parcels including scenic viewsheds will work with the conservation commission and drb to maximize protection of the identified view 4 important farmlands the protected open space must include important farmlands identified in the open space plan to the extent consistent with the landowners right to beneficial use of his or her property this means that if a landowner has only important farmlands or has no other lands physically suitable for development the conservation commission and the drb will work with that landowner to effect a transfer of development rights as provided by of this bylaw or to create an open space development that minimizes consumption of lands that should be protected 5 slopes 30% or more the protected open space must include all slopes of 30% or more except where a variance can be justified as provided by of this bylaw 6 slopes 15%29% the protected open space should include all slopes of 15%29% to the extent consistent with the landowners right to beneficial use of his or her property this means that if a landowner has only slopes or has no other lands physically suitable for development the conservation commission and the drb will work with that landowner to effect a transfer of development rights as provided by of this bylaw or to create an open space development that minimizes consumption of lands that should be protected  unless there are no other lands physically suitable for development creation of a building lot or any other development on 15%29% slopes is not allowed where development is permitted on slopes of 1529% its density shall be reduced to one dwelling unit per 10 acres 7 other lands other lands within the proposed development may be included as protected open space in order to provide the minimum 75% open space required by wdb  and to comply with the contiguity standard of wdb  below  must the protected open space be contiguous yes the protected open space must be contiguous except as provided here it must also be contiguous with any open space on adjoining lots or parcels that is currently protected or is identified for protection in the town plan the drb may allow exceptions to this standard where adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 3 1  | 6 1  a small area that is isolated from the rest of the open space on the site is within a watershed protection buffer required by of this bylaw  or 2  the only home sites that comply with the standards of this chapter are adjacent to protected open space on an adjoining lot or parcel  how is contiguity defined contiguous open space is generally defined as an area of forest andor other natural community that is unfragmented by development and remains in a natural state in establishing standards for contiguity the conservation commission and drb will consider the context of the proposed development including the type and relative value of resources as identified in wdb 27 28 and 29 to be protected and the configuration of open space that will best ensure the protection of those resources  are there limitations on the use of protected open space yes 1 agriculture and forestry protected open space may be used for agriculture forestry community gardens and landscaping 2 crossings crossings of protected open space for roads trails and utility lines are permitted but only where these crossings are consolidated to the maximum extent practical  the width and length of the crossings are minimized  and all areas disturbed during construction of the crossing are restored to their natural functions plans for the restoration of disturbed areas must be included in the runoff and erosion control measures required by of this bylaw 3 trails trails may run open space and no hedge planting or fence shall block such a trail fences are permitted for agricultural purposes but where a fence crosses a trail a gate or stile shall be provided depending on the area disturbed by trail construction runoff and erosion control measures may be required by of this bylaw 4 sewerage any component of an individual or community sewerage system that is entirely underground may be placed in protected open space that is not dedicated to the town or another agency all areas disturbed during the construction of such a system shall be restored to meadow or pasture runoff and erosion control measures must be provided during construction as required by of this bylaw where the protected open space used for the underground components of an individual sewerage system is owned by a homeowners association the application for a permit for construction of that system must be accompanied by an easement from that homeowners association  how can open space be legally protected the open space required by wdb  may be protected using any of the three methods listed here the methods to be used must be clearly established at the time a concept plan is filed for preapplication review 1 dedication for public use the open space created by an open space development may be dedicated to the town or to another public agency designated by the town but only where it would be part of a country park or conservation area identified in the town plan 2 private land conservation the open space created by an open space development may be retained in a block placed under a conservation easement to which the town or another public agency designated by the town is a party this block of open space may be retained by adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 3 1  | 7 the developer for agricultural or other purposes or deeded to an owners association where protected open space is deeded to an owners association the owners are responsible for the maintenance of that open space as required by of this bylaw 3 designated open space the open space created by an open space development may also be protected simply by designation where open space is protected by designation alone no permit for a use that is not permitted by wdb  shall be issued within the designated open space nor shall any amendment of the final plans or boundary adjustments that change the boundaries of the designated open space be approved applicants should note that the protection of open space via designation alone will not result in the award of points in growth management review see wdb   must the protected open space be platted as a separate lot yes the protected open space required by this chapter must be platted as a separate lot  must the protected open space be surveyed yes the protected open space required by this chapter must be shown on the final plans and must be monumented in accordance with the requirements of 5 with the same degree of accuracy as a building lot open space areas must also be marked and the applicant will provide latitude and longitude coordinates from the vermont state grid so that the town can easily find the open space boundaries in the field should the monuments be insufficient 318 housing design in open space developments the 75% open space requirement that is detailed above means that housing or other development may take place on no more than 25% of any site of more than 105 acres  must specific home sites be designated within the 25% or less area that is available for development yes 1 designated homesites proposed home sites that comply with all requirements of this bylaw specifically including wdb 319 must be shown within that portion of a proposed open space development 25% or less where development will be permitted 2 maximum size of designated home sites designated home sites may not exceed the onehalf acre clearing limit of wdb 1 all construction on the site except access driveways utility lines and the underground components of onsite wastewater disposal systems shall be confined to the designated home site  how many home sites what density are permitted in open space developments open space developments may have an average density of no more than one dwelling for every 80000 square feet except that 1  land included in watershed protection buffers and slopes of 30% or more shall not be included in the parcel size for the purposes of calculating the number of home sites permitted and 2  that areas with a slope of 15% or more may have an average density of only one home site for every 10 acres adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 3 1  | 8 3 incentives for lower densities voluntary reductions in density are encouraged by wdb 1 and wdb   what is the minimum lot size in an open space development the minimum lot size shall be 15000 square feet but lot sizes shall vary with the terrain uniform lot sizing that contributes to a suburban character will not be approved  is there a maximum cluster size yes no cluster shall include more than seven lots except as provided by wdb 3111 below  are there requirements for access and connectivity beyond those established elsewhere in this bylaw yes 1 internal circulation open space developments that include more than one cluster shall minimize the number of points of access to public roads by relying on internal roads that link the clusters such roads may cross protected open space in compliance with wdb 2 where the terrain will not allow a road connecting clusters a connecting trail shall be provided 2 connectivity where the terrain allows the drb may require road or trail connections to other properties open space where necessary to provide emergency access or improve neighborhood circulation all crossings of protected open space must comply with the standards of wdb 2  are there minimum distances between clusters of home sites yes clusters of lots must be effectively separated from neighboring properties public ways and each other by open space the following criteria will be used in determining compliance with this standard 1 using the terrain terrain features including existing woods fields that remain in agricultural use ridgelines steep slopes streams wetlands and the watershed protection buffers required by the of this bylaw should be used to separate clusters and to buffer home sites from adjoining properties and public ways whenever possible 2 buffer width the width of the buffers between clusters shall vary with the terrain and the presence of screening vegetation the drb may require that the minimum buffer be anywhere from 100 to 500 feet in making its determination of the minimum required buffer between clusters the drb shall consider the advice of the conservation commission and the following factors  the presence of vegetation and its effectiveness in providing visual screening between clusters and between clusters and public ways   the presence of terrain features including slopes ridges and valleys and their effectiveness in visually separating clusters and separating clusters and public ways  and  the orientation of the proposed cluster to public ways adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 3 1  | 9 3 enhancing buffers the developer may propose and the drb may approve the use of earthen berms and plantings to increase the effectiveness of buffers between clusters and between clusters and public ways 4 adjoining open space the applicant may propose and the drb may find that a narrower buffer is adequate along a property boundary where there is protected open space or terrain that is unsuitable for building on the adjoining property 319 home sites each lot created shall contain a home site that meets the criteria adopted here the concept plan submitted with the preapplication shall show how home sites are individually placed so as to best maintain environmental quality accessibility compatibility with neighboring uses and the rural character this zoning district protects the following criteria will be used in determining compliance with this standard  provide for adequate wastewater treatment each lot shall provide for adequate wastewater treatment either onsite septic system or a community sewerage system as permitted by wdb 31  ensure an adequate water supply the developer shall demonstrate that each dwelling can reasonably expect to obtain an adequate domestic water supply wherever the proposed average density will exceed one dwelling unit for each 10 acres this shall be accomplished by actual onsite well testing supervised by a registered engineer or a groundwater hydrologist  provide safe road access each home site shall have safe access to an existing or proposed public or private road  respect the terrain home sites and the access drives and roads serving them shall be placed along the contours of the land in a way that minimizes grading and the visual impact of the development  provide trail connections home sites shall where possible be connected to the towns trail system  existing or proposed  via the adjoining open space  minimize visual impacts using existing vegetation and terrain where possible homes and accessory buildings shall be effectively screened from view from public ways by existing woodland or forest vegetation or the terrain this does not mean that the development has to be invisible brief views of structures branches of screening vegetation or a break in screening terrain are acceptable it does mean that homes must be carefully sited and that the clearing of existing screening vegetation must be strictly limited 1 clearing limit clearing existing woodland or forest vegetation for a home site including the yard and the space occupied by any accessory structure shall be limited to a halfacre this does not include access driveways utility lines or areas cleared for the underground components of onsite wastewater disposal systems but does include onsite circulation and parking areas 2 breaks in slope forested existing woodland and forest vegetation shall be left in place forming a wooded or forested buffer of at least 50 feet in width at the top of any distinct break in any slope of more than 8% these buffers may be thinned the canopy cover within the view corridor must still be at least 25% to provide one view corridor of no more than 25 adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 3 1  | 10 feet in width for each dwelling the drb may with the advice of the conservation commission permit additional view corridors where the required thinning will not have an adverse visual impact 3 breaks in slope not forested where there is no existing woodland and forest vegetation to be left in place a forest buffer of at least 50 feet in width must be planted at the top of any distinct break in any slope of more than 8% these buffers may include view corridors that are no more than 25 feet in width  minimize visual impacts in open areas where homes and accessory buildings cannot be effectively screened by existing vegetation or the terrain they should be sited where they will be visually absorbed by a slope and or woods this means that the structure or structures are sited and designed so that they blend into the background created by a slope or a stand of trees no part of a structure that is absorbed is ever outlined against the sky as seen from any public way further there is low contrast as measured by color and reflectivity between the structure and the background provided by the vegetation and terrain  supplement screening or absorption as necessary to augment visual screening or absorption a developer may also propose and the drb with the advice of the conservation commission may approve 1  a building height limit of less than 36 feet  2  the installation and maintenance of screening vegetation and berms  3  limiting the area of glass and other reflective surfaces and specifying exterior colors that do not contrast with the landscape  andor 4  limiting building bulk or arranging building mass to reduce the visual impact of a dwelling or accessory structures this may include placing buildings along rather than across a slope andor stepping a building into the slope to minimize grading  demonstrate compliance applicants may be required to place brightlycolored balloons erect story poles or provide threedimensional visual simulations to demonstrate that a typical home and outbuildings would be absorbed by the vegetation or terrain or that the installation of berms and plantings and architectural techniques would result in visual absorption of the home 3110 community sewerage systems community sewerage systems serving a single cluster of lots may be used to help protect open space where the use of individual onsite systems is limited by terrain conditions  can a community sewerage system be installed anywhere no community sewerage systems may not be used where the soils at the proposed site are unsuitable or only marginally suitable for the use of such systems  what measures are required to obtain approval of a community sewerage system community sewerage systems are required improvements subject to all requirements of of this bylaw specifically including the continuing maintenance requirements of wdb 72 adopted by the selectboard  amended  williston unified development bylaw p a g e 3 1  | 11 3112 barn restoration as provided by  of the town plan preservation and restoration of historic barns will be encouraged by permitting residential uses of such structures that include more than two dwelling units  what makes a barn historic an historic barn is one that is listed on the national or state registers of historic places  what about the density standard relaxation of the use standard in this zoning district does not constitute a relaxation of the density requirements a landowner who wishes to place for example four apartments in an historic barn must still have a parcel of at least 320000 square feet  how will the plans for restoration of an historic barn be reviewed restoration of an historic barn requires a discretionary permit with review by the haac preceding review by the drb  what standards will the haac and drb use in their review barn restoration plans will be evaluated and approved or rejected based on how well they maintain the original agricultural appearance and context of the structure while providing a reasonable housing choice the secretary of interiors standards for rehabilitation  shall be utilized in the review of barn restoration plans  are any other nonagricultural uses of restored barns permitted yes restored barns may be used for home businesses with the approval of an administrative permit and for use as banquet facilities with the approval of a discretionary permit by the drb 3113

used primarily for office buildings senior housing and the vermont technical college the area is almost builtout as a conventional office park where relatively large buildings are surrounded by surface parking and landscaped grounds the standards adopted here provide for that pattern to continue but include three important changes from the previous zoning 1 relationship to the street new buildings in the bpzd will be required to have a direct relationship to the street as well as to their own parking lots resulting in somewhat more pedestrianoriented development 2 vermont technical college vermont technical colleges williston campus has replaced some retail and office uses a technical college can involve a considerable diversity of principal and accessory uses all of which are now explicitly permitted 3 retailing the previous zoning permitted a wide range of retail uses in the bpzd there are currently only four retail stores however and the town plan suggests that retailing should be concentrated to the south in the taft corners and mixed use commercial zoning districts table 32a still permits a wide range of retail uses but retailing will now be confined to lots with frontage on route 2 retail in other parts of this district can only be permitted as an accessory use as described in wdb 172 4 restaurants standalone restaurants are not permitted in the bpzd

the boundaries of the rzd the boundaries of the residential zoning district are shown on the official zoning map that accompanies this bylaw  what is the purpose of the rzd this zoning district includes willistons suburban residential neighborhoods its purpose has long been to ensure that incompatible uses do not appear in those neighborhoods these standards add another important goal to encourage a somewhat more compact diverse and pedestrianfriendly pattern of residential development that also protects important open space resources to help achieve this goal the standards adopted here increase the density of development permitted in the rzd this increase in density also recognizes the fact that some of willistons most pleasant residential neighborhoods  meadow brook and williston hills for example  were developed at higher densities and are now nonconforming permitting a somewhat higher density will also encourage the provision of more affordable housing  what uses are permitted in the rzd this is a residential zoning district very few other uses are permitted 1 residential patterns development in the rzd must use a pattern that protects open space resources and results in a pedestrianfriendly neighborhood that is organized around one or more focal points wherever practicable focal points will usually take the form of a neighborhood green or park but other focal points like a community center may be proposed 2 nonresidential the only nonresidential uses permitted in this zoning district are child care centers churches elementary and middle schools and

identifies a fair rational connection for new development to pay for the additional demands placed on that infrastructure vermont statute 24 vsa  authorizes municipalities to levy impact fees on new development as a means of allocating the cost of new capital facilities to the development that will benefit from those facilities this can include fees to offset the costs of facilities built in the past with excess capacity for anticipated future development  it can also include facilities planned to be built to accommodate future development the costs of such infrastructure shall only include the portion associated with new capacity to accommodate the future developments demand this impact fee study report outlines the future growth anticipated for the town of williston and documents the basis for implementing a transportation impact fee to pay for additional capacity associated with the increased demand for transportation mobility while conforming to the conditions imposed by 24 vsa 1 legal background basic impact fee standards according to the american planning association  the imposition of a fee must be rationally linked the rational nexus to an impact created by a particular development and the demonstrated need for related capital improvements pursuant to a capital improvement plan and program  some benefit must accrue to the development as a result of the payment of a fee  the amount of the fee must be a proportionate fair share of the costs of the improvements made necessary by the development and must not exceed the cost of the improvements  a fee cannot be imposed to address existing deficiencies except where they are exacerbated by new development  funds received under such a program must be segregated from the general fund and used solely for the purposes for which the fee is established  the fees collected must be encumbered or expended within a reasonable timeframe to ensure that needed improvements are implemented  the fee assessed cannot exceed the cost of the improvements and credits must be given for outside funding sources such as federal and state grants developer initiated improvements for impacts related to new development etc and local tax payments which fund capital improvements for example 2  the fee cannot be used to cover normal operation and maintenance or personnel costs but must be used for capital improvements or under some linkage programs affordable housing job training child care etc typical management activities  the fee established for specific capital improvements should be reviewed at least every two years to determine whether an adjustment is required and similarly the capital improvement plan and budget should be reviewed at least every 5 to 8 years  provisions must be included in the ordinance to permit refunds for projects that are not constructed since no benefit will have manifested  impact fee payments are typically required to be made as a condition of approval of the development either at the time the building or occupancy permit is issued vermonts impact fee statute does not preclude the use of funds for administrative duties associated with the management of the impact fee program nationally it is common practice to collect and expend impact fees to cover time and expenses associated with the creation management and other administration of the impact fee program these funds often cover the salary portion of the impact fee administrator staff time in the preparation and review of impact fee studies consultant or staff time preparing impact fee needs reports and ordinance support 3 20 growth and development 21 population the town of williston has 9341 persons as of the 2017 american community survey 5year estimates making it the 6th most populous community within chittenden county the town has seen consistent demand for housing originally as a bedroom community for the larger employment centers in burlington south burlington and essex however since the 1990s williston diversified its land use to become a major commercial destination in the taft corners area the population continued to grow at rates far higher than those experienced within vermont and chittenden county figure 1 shows the 10year growth rates for williston chittenden county and vermont figure 1 historical population growth rates source williston town plan 22 households the town of williston has traditionally assessed residential impact fees at a household unit the american community survey estimates that as of 201 there are 3897 households 4 the majority of the households 78% are owner occupied with an average of 242 persons per household the remaining 22% of households are renter occupied with 221 persons per household1 there have been attempts nationally to reduce the effect that transportation impact fees may have on housing costs and especially affordable housing changing the assessment on the square footage of the home or on the number of bedrooms provides a stronger relationship to the number of occupants and the quantity of travel consumed nationally over the past half century the average size number of persons of the household has dropped from 367 persons per household in 1940 to 253 in 2016 as shown in figure 2 figure 2 average household size 19402016 source us census data williston is no different according to the town plan the average size of the household has come down inline with national trends source us census datawilliston town plan figure 2g 1 2015 american community survey 5year estimates 5 the 2017 breakdown of households and

activities are carried out to support the commercial activities but also there are recreation and health trips that are also generated employees require a multimodal transportation infrastructure 6 30 transportation 31 overview the town of williston is expected to continue to experience a population growth and land use development at pace exceeding both vermont and chittenden county averages the exit 12 growth center is the hub of the commercial activity and is becoming increasingly diverse in land use particularly east of vt2a with a large residential area being constructed over the past decade the towns comprehensive plan articulates a vision with several land use and transportation goals to manage and facilitate the growth to meet the needs of the community the towns plan states a vision to  concentrate and limit high intensity development to areas within the towns designated growth center in and around taft corners  permit the flexibility and intensity of use necessary to foster creation of a designconscious mixed use pedestrianfriendly commercial center around taft corners  encourage and support the use of mass transit and nonmotorized modes of transportation use development policies and transportation facilities planning the town plans to achieve this vision by  working with developers to build grid streets  working with vtrans on other circulation improvements  developing a master transportation plan comprised of a major road plan sidewalks paths and trail network a public transportation plan and connectivity between networks and land use impact fees are an important tool that the town can leverage by assessing fees on new land use development that would generate additional traffic and transportation demands placing a burden on the existing facilities and would benefit from additional transportation capacity 32 impact fee basis it is understood that future development generates additional new local demand for travel that begins andor ends within the town additional growth in population throughout the county and state generates additional demand for travel although those trips begins and ends outside of the town  and therefore not directly associated with future development in the town these trips are considered the impact fee analysis focuses on local traffic generated by anticipated future development the basic unit of analysis is the peak hour trip end which is either the origin or the destination of a trip any given trip has two trip endsan origin and a destination any trip that either begins or ends within the town is considered to be a local trip 7 the impact fee will also be assessed on a trip regardless of mode the vermont state legislature under act 34 of 2011 identified the complete street principles that defined transportation capacity consistently regardless of travel mode the projects in table 6 add multimodal capacity  offering residents employees patrons a variety of modal travel options the pm peak hour is the analysis hour in which the fee is assessed on the number of peak hour vehicle trips the pm peak hour is the typical design hour2 in the town of williston it is noted that specific developments may generate a significant number of vehicle trips outside the design hour some uses a church for example may have different peak hours of traffic generation cumulatively however the highest traffic volume at most locations in williston is during the pm peak design hour as defined here traffic impact fees are not assessed on trips that occur outside of the pm peak design hour limiting the period of assessment to the pm peak hour creates a common hour of analysis and provides the rational nexus required to assess impact fees by assessing a fee during a particular hour of analysis the fee also acts as a transportation demand management tdm technique this can encourage the development of land uses that generate travel demand outside of the peak hours to more efficient use of the existing transportation infrastructure by using available capacity at other times of the day this same principle goes for shifting modes as congestion may rise for one mode of travel some users will shift modes to utilize spare capacity 2 design hour is defined as the 30th highest hour of volume during the year 8 40 future travel demand 41 overview the town of williston is anticipated to continue to receive a higher share of the county growth than other towns and communities within chittenden county the ccrpc regional travel demand model is a comprehensive tool to forecast the number of trips and traffic to be generated by future growth and land use development within willison and the county the tool was used to estimate the amount of traffic growth likely by 2030 the future year 2040 was forecast only after the initial base impact fees were calculated and after considering the feasibility of constructing the projects identified for impact fee funding 42 overview of chittenden county transportation model in 2015 the ccrpc initiated a significant update to the regional travel demand model that included population and employment projections for each municipality for five year increments out to 2050 the ccrpc forecasts were used as the initial base that the town amended given more recent information on land use and anticipated changes the land use changes were entered back into the ccrpc regional travel demand model and run to generate estimates of new traffic generation vehicle miles traveled and percentage of growth in traffic that is local see above the model is a traditional fourstep trip based travel demand model the four steps are iterated to achieve an optimized routing pattern with stable travel times the steps are defined as follows  trip generation  estimates the number of person trips produced and attracted to each traffic analysis zone taz the land use inputs were established with each community by allocated future households and employees manually to the tazs  trip distribution  connects person trips between tazs  mode choice  splits person trips into single occupant vehicles shared vehicle trips transit trips or walkbike trips  assignment  selects the shortest route for each vehicle and transit trip traveling from one taz to another based on distance and travel time 43 trip generation forecasts this study identified the anticipated changes to occur in williston by 2030 the land use changes included household growth and increases in specific sectors of the economy in total an estimated 612 new households would be constructed by 2030 and 2584 new employees would be based in williston 9 table 3 land use changes anticipated in williston by 2030 2015  2030 land use changes residential growth housing units new households 612 employment growth employees accommodations 24 commercial 974 industrial 735 institutional 164 educational 15 retail 672 total employment growth 2584 these land use changes were evaluated in the travel model in addition to all the other growth and changes in land uses within the county by 2030 the regional travel model accounts for growth in other communities within chittenden county as well as estimated growth for trips that originate outside the county and for trips that may only pass county while the model accounts for walking biking and transit the trips that are outputs of the model are vehicle trips only the local land use growth in williston and the growth occurring within chittenden county and the state all increase the total vehicle miles traveled vmt on the roads in williston table 4 shows the portion of vmt growth associated with land use origin or destination in williston and total vmt using willistons roads excluding any vmt on the i89 freeway the local share of the change in vmt is 69% table 4 local vs total vmt change local vmt nonhighway total vmt nonhighway pm daily pm daily 2015 16471 191043 2015 23631 262920 2030 18382

number of vehicle trips forecast from the travel model is the net result after the model accounts for a variety of considerations much like a traffic study using the institute of transportation engineers ite trip generation manual has to adjust for density site location eg urban suburban proximity to transit and mix of nearby uses  the travel model accounts for all these factors specifically the factors tdm and nonauto travel internal capture mix of complementary land uses within a travel analysis zone and passby trips that detour to a location en route to their primary destination 10 these adjustments are applicable in a large part of williston that has seen rapid growth and development as well as increase in the diversity and mix of land uses the density diversity and design the three ds of the land uses in the highlighted areas of williston enable individuals to travel between land uses without using major roads are close enough to allow for walking biking and are the locations primarily served by transit the effect of the three ds in this area reduces the net number of vehicle trips by 45% the land use changes in the area shown in figure 3 includes 543 housing units and 2295 new employees by 2030 the ite trip generation for these land uses indicates that around 2449 trips would be generated after accounting for the three ds the net number of new vehicle trips from the area in figure 3 is forecast to be 1347 figure 3 growth and diversity land use zones in williston the remaining areas of williston will experience more modest growth of 69 new housing units and 286 new employees by 2030 these land uses are expected to be located in areas that will not benefit from diversity of land uses or proximity to avoid traveling by car and therefore expected to generate 196 new peak hour vehicle trips by 203 the town is anticipated to generate an additional 1542 new vehicle trips during the pm peak hour the combination of vehicle trips nonmotorized trips and trips that pass williston are shown in figure 4 resulting in 2635 new total pm peak hour trips in williston by 2030 figure 4 2030 traffic growth changes estimating growth from 2030 to 2040 the travel demand model provided forecasts for the transportation demand associated with the land use changes from 2015 to 2030 it was determined during the course of the study that the projects being pursued would benefit from extending over a longer time period  stretching to 2040 the growth forecasts developed by the ccrpc estimates that households and employment would grow by 98% between 2030 and 2040 the person trips for 2040 was forecast by extrapolating the growth from 2015 to 203 resulting in an 8% increase from 2030 the difference is that not all land uses generate trips at the same quantity during the pm peak hour table 5 land use changes by 2040 total units by 2040 change 2015  2040 households 4913 1050 employment 17389 4146 trips 9806 2845 12 50 projects the town has identified seven number of projects eligible for impact fee expenditures table 6 shows the transportation capital projects identified for local funding all the projects have been developed over many years course of several transportation studies plans and community conversations there is evidence that the standard of service of transportation will deteriorate in the absence of these improvements

that the growth and development does not pay for more than their proportion of impact or their fair share this can be evaluated by comparing the current standard of service to the standard of service with and without the impact fee projects there are two methodologies used in this test a ratio of linear miles b person miles of capacity ratio expansion of capacity the town of williston has a diverse and widespread transportation network excluding the i89 interstate there are 164 lane miles of roads 364 miles of bike lanes and 46 miles of shared use paths there is also an extensive sidewalk network 13 the existing supply of transportation infrastructure within the town of williston is summarized in table 7 gis data and aerial imagery were used to calculate the supply the existing number of households and employees were used to develop a ratio of users per mile of infrastructure table 7 existing supply of transportation facilities miles ratio hh per mile ratio

current ratio of lane miles to unit of growth especially compared to the number of lane miles planned in the impact fee projects column f the town of williston is looking to provide residents and guests the opportunity to change the way travel is done rather than continue the status quo a ratio based expansion in the number of linear miles of infrastructure retains the existing proportions and doesnt easily translate to shifting capacity from vehicle miles to bike lane miles for example person miles of capacity vermonts complete street legislation in 2011 act 34 h198 directed that all users of the transportation system regardless of mode are considered in all state and municipally managed transportation projects the recognition that all users of the system are equally valued in the development of projects provides the context for developing a modeagnostic person miles 14 capacity analysis of the transportation system in williston the existing transportation system has a capacity

hcm 6th edition see appendix tbd 15  there is a deterioration of the existing standard experience within the town of williston due to future growth and land use development in the absence of the impact fee projects the standard supply to demand ratio falls from 50 to 422  the fee projects funded by impact fees levied on future growth and land use development does not improve conditions above what is experienced today adding the new capacity to the existing capacity would result in a slight deterioration of overall standards of service supply to demand ratio of 50 to 457 16 60 base impact fee base impact fees are the raw unadjusted fees which are later discounted for credits and other incentives the fee will be charged on a pm peak hour per trip basis this is consistent with the current ordinance in williston the trip basis is consistent with the vermont agency of transportations statewide impact fee enabling legislation per act 145 of 2014transportation impact fees 10 vsa  the base fee is described by the following equation the base impact fee is calculated as the cost of projects divided by the number of new trips during the pm peak hour as shown in table 12 table 12 cost per pm peak hour trip cost of impact fee projects table 6 $5526800 number of new pm peak hour trips table 5 2845 cost per pm peak hour trip $1943 61 credits credits are adjustments to the base impact fee that a land use would be assessed within the town of williston two credits are possible  infrastructure credit and revenue credits infrastructure credits any land use development that physically constructs any project identified in table 6 is eligible for a reduction in impact fees up to the total amount of the impact fee liability if the cost of the project exceeds the impact fee liability the town has the latitude to allow that credit to offset future impact fees imposed on the entity that constructed the infrastructure project the credit is also applicable even if the project was a condition of the land use development during the review process this reduces the perception of double payments and incentivizes development in areas identified for transportation infrastructure revenue credits revenue credits discount the base impact fee to reduce the chance that a land use development in the town would be funding the same capital improvement different funds this frequently occurs when a land to be developed pays property taxes prior to the development of the land and after the development when a portion of which goes to fund the capital project that the impact fee contributed toward in this case it is necessary to offset the impact fee by a credit value to eliminate the double payment toward the same capacity the credits equal the discounted present value of the stream of tax payments used for those expenditures impact fee   cost per pm peak hour trip x new pm peak hour trips  applicable credits 17 the town of willistons impact fee is based on the total number of new pm peak hour trips that will consume transportation capacity not all new trips are associated with changes in land use development  roughly 32% of the new trips are associated with trips that neither originate nor are destinated for points in williston therefore $1768576 or 32% of the cost of the impact fee projects will be borne by other nonimpact fee funds  namely the property tax this equates to $84218 annually to be raised by the property tax the stream of tax payments is broken into two parts  that which occurs before the land use development occurs called past tax payments and that which occurs after the development comes onto the grand list called future tax payments the past tax payment determines the amount of tax payments on the raw land made prior to the payment of the impact fee the future tax payment accounts for the stream of future tax payments made on the new development after the impact fee was paid residential development past tax payments the predevelopment tax payments for any given residential development for example a dwelling constructed in 2022 includes tax payments made in years 2019 this stream of payments is converted to the net present value in the year of construction using a discount rate of 5% table 13 summarizes the value of predevelopment credits for a housing unit table 13 residential revenue credit for

assumptions to develop the residential revenue credit analysis  average value of empty residential land per acre   $100000 assessed with the input from town assessor by looking at an array of land values for smaller sites planned for development as well as more rural and larger sites that could be subdivided in the future the higher value provides a protection to the town by creating a larger credit which should avoid any chance of double counting the impact fee revenue 20  average annual growth of the grand list is 2% derived from a longrun average  2019 town grand list value is $2040000000 taxable value is $20000000 tax rate on every $100 of value nonresidential development the value of impact fee credits for the nonresidential development is split into two categories predevelopment and post development given the variety of nonresidential construction types locations and overall variation in the value that nonresidential land uses have within the grand list the credit mechanism is based not on an average property value but based on a unit of $1000 property value the predevelopment credit is to be calculated on the assessed value of the land upon which the development has occurred or will occur this requires some judgment in terms of how a fractional use of a parcel is defined for the value of the nonresidential development for instance a fiveacre parcel could be 20% for each oneacre subdivision  or due to concentration within the five acres the limited development footprint may be closer to 40% table 15 nonresidential revenue credit for
