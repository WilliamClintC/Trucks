minimize offsite stormwater runoff increase onsite filtration and minimize the discharge of pollutants to ground water and surface water consideration should be given to reducing the need for

and the proposed project are then subjected to the planned unit development density evaluation steps to arrive at an allowable number of dwelling units or sites 4 the suitable area within each tier is divided by the single residential lot size standard for lakes or for rivers the single residential lot width standard times the tier depth unless the local unit of government has specified an alternative minimum lot size for rivers which shall then be used to yield a base density of dwelling units or sites for each tier proposed locations and numbers of dwelling units or sites for the residential planned unit developments are then compared with the tier density and suitability analyses herein 5 increases to the dwelling unit or dwelling site base densities previously determined are

article 5 airport district 1449 purpose and authority a this subdivision is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by ms   as amended from time to time it is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity and may reduce the size of the area available for the landing takingoff and maneuvering of aircraft thereby impairing the utility of the airport and the public investment therein it is also found that the social and financial costs of disrupting existing land uses around airports in built up urban areas particularly established residential neighborhoods often outweigh the benefits of a reduction in airport hazards that might result from the elimination or removal of those uses b accordingly it is hereby declared 1 the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport in question  2 it is therefor necessary in the interest of the public health public safety and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented and that this should be accomplished to the extent legally possible by exercise of the police power without compensation  and 3 the elimination or removal of existing land uses particularly established residential neighborhoods in built up urban areas or their designation as nonconforming uses is not in the public interest and should be avoided whenever possible consistent with reasonable standards of safety c it is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination removal alteration mitigation or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property interests therein 1450 short title this subdivision shall be known and may be cited as the redwood falls municipal airport
