2 broadway district a general provisions 1 the overriding vision for broadway is to enhance the town and to create a vibrant business district based on traditional architecture urban planning and design principles broadway deserves special attention and more specific guidelines than the central business area as a whole broadway is defined as the faceblock of the street extending  300 and 400 blocks the alleys between capitol street and wall street provide the eastern and western boundaries for the specific guidelines found on broadway figure 2 2 the buildings of the broadway district should be permanent in character retail and commercial uses shall be located on the first floor with office service establishments except vehicular service and residential uses found above on the second and third floors there are specific details and guidelines which are called out in this section that serve to guide the construction and redevelopment of properties on broadway the purpose of these guidelines are to encourage mixeduse buildings in the broadway district mixeduse buildings are multistory buildings that contain more than one land use for example a threestory building could have a restaurant on the first floor a service business or office on the second floor and apartments on the third floor 3 the character of eagles broadway district shall be referential to the business districts of traditional western slope communities and the state vernacular architectural style see appendix n at the end of this title downtown districts found in telluride salida leadville breckenridge montrose glenwood springs carbondale and districts located on the front range of the state are all examples of the styles of architecture building massing and scale that should be considered when designing buildings for the broadway district in eagle these communities vary from traditional mining towns to rural agricultural villages the buildings in the broadway district will be designed with these precedents in mind b goals and objectives the goals and objectives of this section are 1 preserve the character and integrity of the broadway district by promoting appropriate architecture and site planning 2 strengthen visual continuity of the streetscape by enforcing setbacks and controlling building orientation 3 reinforce the traditional character of the town by incorporating traditional building materials and native plant material in new development 4 the buildings and site plans should be referential to traditional western slope communities and the state vernacular architectural style but a strict period replication is not the intent of this section 5 the district and each individual building should enhance the overall goals and objectives and be appropriate to todays lifestyles 6 there should be a sense of simplicity and repose in the building mass without creating buildings that are too busy or eclectic 7 residential units lofts and offices should be located above retail restaurant and commercial uses residential use is not allowed at the street level or basement level for new construction or renovated buildings 8 the character of storefronts should be carefully considered to include higher ceilings in the first floor spaces signage canopies awnings and appropriate window fenestration 9 building character in this area is extremely important the look and feel of this district taken as a whole is intended to be comprised of distinctive qualities that will establish its identity and create a desirable place to spend time 10 roof and parapet forms can provide interest scale richness and height variation to the buildings these forms should also be utilized to screen unsightly mechanical systems and appropriately direct snow and water removal from the buildings steps should be taken so that these and any other building forms do not pose a falling ice or snow hazard to users passersby or adjacent property c building setbacks 1 buildings have a zero lot line allowance to the front property line buildings shall not be built greater than 15 feet from the front property line figure 3 figure 3 zero setback and maximum 15foot setback 2 in the broadway district properties are encouraged to be built to the front lot line exceptions to the zero lot line recommendation would potentially be for the creation of active pedestrian spaces semipublic patio spaces outdoor dining opportunities temporary displays of merchandise sidewalk sales and landscaping details where appropriate special consideration may be given to vary the front setback to allow for keeping mature and largecaliper trees that exist on some properties along broadway in addition this setback may allow for the creation of useable spaces at the ground level but the second and third floors may overhang these spaces and extend to the front lot line new buildings are encouraged to be built to the front and side property lines but this shall be decided on a case by case basis figure 4 5 see h of this section for specific guidelines on allowed uses in the front yard areas figure 4 usable space at the ground level  used for outdoor dining in this example figure 5 usable space at the ground level entrance with cantilevered element extending to the front property line  used for temporary or daily merchandising in this example d building height 1 new construction shall place the first floor at ground level 2 in the broadway district buildings may be three stories in height 3 in order to maintain proper proportions and enhance the existing vertical to horizontal ratios of the broadway district there are two maximum building height limits depending on the scenario a scenario one  35foot height limit new threestory buildings have a height limit of 35 feet in this scenario parapet walls may exceed the height limit by no more than four feet a parapet is a low wall projecting from the edge of a platform terrace or roof thus the maximum building height for scenario one is 39 feet including the maximum fourfoot parapet wall figure 6 b scenario two  42foot height limit the maximum building height for scenario two is 42 feet including the parapet wall in this scenario the first two stories may be located on the property line but the third story must be steppedback from the lot line at a 35degree bulk plane angle the total height limit for the ground level and second story must not be greater than 30 feet in this case facade material on the stepback must match the majority of the facade material of the first two floors directly below the section that is steppedback figure 7 8 except as provided herein refer to for specific zoning standards relating to height limits figure 6 scenario one  35 foot building height including parapet walls and mechanical access figure 7 image of second and third story setbacks  note the matching facade materials on the second and third story figure 8 scenario two  third story setback when a total height of building is greater than 35 feet 4 the bulk plane setback for three story buildings greater than 35 feet shall apply to corner lots which front broadway and a secondary street 2nd 3rd 4th or 5th streets figure 9 figure 9 scenario two  third floor setbacks on broadway and a cross street within the broadway district 5 corner treatments at street intersections may exceed the height limit and shall be decided on a case by case basis the height limit to the extent of which a corner detail may exceed the height limit shall be no greater than 30 percent of the total building height careful consideration will be given to circumstances where the intent of the corner treatment shall be to define the corner as a landmark opportunity that shall be in scale with the building and district as a whole corner treatments may exceed the height limit if the noninhabitable architectural feature serves to add punctuation and significance to the building and to the district out of proportion or superfluous detailing will not be allowed figures 10 11 a scenario one if the corner building is built to the 35foot height limit corner treatments are allowed according to the standards described above b scenario two no excess of the height limit is allowed if the corner building is built to the 42foot height limit figure 10 corner treatment in excess of 35foot height limit  reviewed on a case by case basis and not allowed under scenario two figure 11 corner treatment that would be allowed in excess of building height limits  note that the elements are in scale with the buildings and with the district and add appropriate architectural interest and detailing to the corner  reviewed on a case by case basis e building massformorientation 1 new construction shall maintain and reinforce the pattern of traditional building forms and shapes along the streetscape 2 buildings should present their front facades to the street that they face corner lots should address both streets that they face 3 front building facades should create a rhythm of architecture and interest blank walls are inappropriate the same rhythm that is established on the front facades should be established on any side street facades 4 buildings and additions should continue the existing pattern of architecture both vertically and horizontally to reflect traditional patterns found in traditional western slope communities 5 relation to human scale should be a consideration in the design of the facades and the spaces created adjacent to the pedestrian realm 6 new construction should exemplify the proportions found in traditional western slope communities and the state vernacular architectural style f architectural detail 1 doors should be similar in character proportion scale and material to those of traditional buildings 2 large expanses of uninterrupted glass on exterior facades whether vertical or horizontal are inappropriate on renovated residential buildings used for commercial purposes glass panels shall have low reflectivity and high transparency allowing for visual access into the building at ground level 3 an effective way to subtly invoke traditional building character is to express the basic structural organization of the buildings in their facades the vertical structure can be expressed as opaque vertical areas substantial enough to be perceived as columns and pilasters figure 12 figure 12 brick facade which is designed to look like vertical columns  these are not true supporting columns but add to the traditional character for this building 4 the location of the floor levels should be expressed as areas of horizontal opacity glass curtain walls are not allowed 5 storefront designs shall compliment the traditional western slope community ambiance while reflecting todays lifestyles storefronts do not have to be period reproductions and should appear open inviting and be a minimum of 60 percent transparent the storefront design standard applies to the first floor only 6 storefront windows should extend from the sidewalk to a height of at least 12 feet transom windows may be included in the minimum window height calculation the sill plate of a retail display window may begin at the sidewalk level and shall be no higher than three feet above the sidewalk elevation the window base need not match the building material but may include metal wood stone or masonry figures 13 14 figure 13 window height diagram and explanation of required storefront design elements figure 14 storefront windows plate glass and transom low sill plate at street level and articulated entry 7 storefront windows may be set parallel to the curb or storefront windows and entries may be articulated by creating areas of indentation figure 14 8 circumstances will arise where it is necessary to add muntin systems to windows these may be true divided light windows or muntin systems adhered to both sides of the glazing system onesided snapin muntin systems are not permitted 9 windows on the second and third floors will be shorter in height than those occurring at ground level due to the smaller floortoceiling heights these window units should be vertical in proportion and may be doublehung or divided light windows on the second and third floors should be arranged singly or in groupings that result in a composition that agrees with the composition at the first floor 10 passages and entries to the second level shall be distinguished architecturally passages that lead to a rear parking area should be clearly signed the architectural elements which express these entrances should appear to be supported by adequate pilaster expressions where it interfaces with the building retail tenants on both sides of passages are encouraged to add display windows into and along the passages articulated secondlevel entries and passage ways may create display conditions where a merchandising corner is appropriate and an indentation may create suitable space for door swings door swings into the rightofway are prohibited 11 corner entrances are encouraged where they are possible they have the advantage of addressing two streets and an intersection resulting in a unique degree of visibility for those businesses that create them they also contribute more animation to the district as a whole figure 15 figure 15 corner entrance 12 the use of cornices to visually terminate the top of building facades is encouraged the cornice is the uppermost section of moldings along the top of a wall or just below a roof in most cases the cornice will be established below a parapet wall that continues vertically past the cornice line cornices may project from the building line and into a public rightofway a maximum of 18 inches refer to for specific zoning standards relating to projections balconies porches or decks are not allowed to project into the public rightofway 13 fixed overhangs architectural overhangs used to provide protection from sun and weather at the first level are considered canopies they may be constructed of opaque materials glass or their combination if glass is used a frosted or heavily fritted finish shall be required to obscure dirt metal canopies will also be considered on a case by case basis canopies shall be cantilevered or bracketed from the main building facade and may project a maximum of six feet the lowest point of the canopy element shall not be less than 12 feet above the sidewalk see f14 of this section for an explanation of design standards for ornamental elements such as brackets railings and awnings 14 awnings ornamental elements such as brackets railings and awnings should be in scale with similar traditional buildings modest ornamental details should be considered but highly ornate decorative features that would compete with traditional architectural details are inappropriate fabric for awnings shall be matte finish plastic material plastic coverings and internally illuminated awning assemblies are prohibited awnings shall not interfere with pedestrian traffic or any maintenance equipment that the town may employ in the public rightofway 15 porches on residential structures used for commercial purposes should be of a size and proportion similar to that seen historically in the broadway district porches should project from the central form and have a separate roof 16 stacks vents cooling towers elevator structures and similar mechanical building appurtenances and spires domes cupolas towers and similar noninhabitable building appurtenances may exceed applicable height limitations by up to 30 percent of the total building height the need for this height limit excess for mechanical appurtenances must be documented and proven that no other engineering solution would eliminate the need to exceed the height limit for example a building may require heating or cooling equipment to be located on the roof any mechanical equipment or similar noninhabitable building appurtenances will be required to be shielded with appropriate building materials that would match the rest of the building or painted to match the color scheme of the building care is required to be taken to eliminate the visual impact of any excess to the height limit from surrounding streets and alleyways this situation will be decided on a case by case basis figure 16 figure 16 parapet walls and mechanical access g building materials 1 materials shall be predominantly brick stone handchiseled stone metal or wood siding a combination of these materials on a single building may be acceptable for example buildings that are predominantly masonry or brick may have the entrance details or a window sash that is trimmed in wood all materials should be in character with those traditionally employed in western slope communities in general buildings in this zone district are meant to convey a sense of permanence and the use of appropriate materials should reflect the goal manufactured products that are made to simulate natural materials such as hardiplankc or precast concrete panels made to simulate limestone shall be reviewed on a case by case basis when brick is used as a primary facade material variation in the detailing of the brick to cast shadow lines is encouraged 2 segmented horizontal siding as traditionally seen on wood and woodclad ranch buildings is appropriate  maximum overlap dimension shall be eight inches sandstone is appropriate when used as a foundation material  however stone cladding over large portions of a surface is not a documented traditional use and is inappropriate moss rock is unacceptable as a facade material modular panel materials are not allowed all facade materials shall have low reflectivity concrete block is prohibited on front facades 3 pitched roof materials shall be wood or asphalt shingles and sheet metal is a documented traditional roof material and is acceptable metal roof colors shall be muted figure 17 the side facade material must match the front facade material for a length of at least 15 feet 4 exterior facade material along the side of the building must

ornamentals are intended to be lower plant materials used as massings that range in height from one foot to three feet ii appropriate plantings include annuals perennials grasses small ornamental tree varieties or shrubs that flower have colorful winter bark or showy fruits heavy screening of the building with trees shrubs and other plantings are not allowed  the exception to this situation would be to allow for keeping mature and largecaliper trees that exist on some properties along broadway lawns are allowed provided there is an appropriate hardscaped path to the entrance of the building landscaped areas will be reviewed on a case by case basis 2 front yard fencing fencing in front yards shall be no taller than three feet fences shall be of wooden pickets wood and wire wrought iron or

areas for demonstrated security purposes only and must be vinylcoated black or green 4 site and building lighting the nighttime illumination of the broadway district should help create a warm inviting place while providing good color rendition of its visitors objects and surfaces site lighting is intended to facilitate safe and easy movement of pedestrians by adequately illuminating front yard areas it is also intended to reveal special architectural features and landscaping features that are important to the civic life of the broadway district at the same time care must be taken to minimize problems created by artificial lighting such as unnecessary illumination too much illumination glare and light pollution to the sky luminaires shall be used that cast the light downward lowcutoff luminaires rather than outward broadcast luminaires in the broadway district an appropriate lighting strategy must be employed to allow the internal lighting of the buildings and the

the building and property k color the colors recommended for use in the broadway district derive from those colors found occurring naturally in the rock soils trees grasses and water of the eagle river valley and the brush creek valley the colors have been arranged in hue groups of yellows greens blues reds and grays for the ease of evaluation figures 1923 in addition asphalt shingle roof blends here represented as averaged single colors which hold the most promise of working effectively with these colors are also shown in the cool and warm gray palettes figure 2425 each color has been matched to the ici paint system for ease of communication the natural colors provided should be carefully evaluated when combined to form paint schemes for use on buildings many of the rich colors found in nature usually appear softer in their natural context than when seen individually since perception is usually of distance atmosphere distribution and combination with many other colors since colors for buildings are used in larger unbroken areas some of the colors provided here may have to be shifted or weakened made more grayish before they can be effectively used in an appropriate color

commercial general cg and industrial i under the provisions of this title a the commercial general cg zone district is for commercial and tourist uses including lodging dining recreation facilities and compatible uses and for heavier commercial uses low impact manufacturing uses and compatible uses b the industrial i zone district is for a wide range of industrial uses and compatible uses 2 the chambers avenue areas consist of relatively flat and easily developed land adjacent to i70 and immediately south of the highway interchange at eagle because of its development potential vehicular accessibility and visibility from the highway the town has zoned this area for general commercial and industrial development chambers avenue parallels i70 and serves subdivided commercial and industrial parcels along both sides of its length 3 although the chambers areas are somewhat separate from and independent of other portions of eagle commercial and industrial development here has a very significant impact on the character and perceived quality of eagle for the most part drivers along i70 view this area from an elevated position set as a foreground to the larger mountain and eagle river landscape in addition to this visibility the areas have developed with commercial activities serving the i70 corridor the chambers avenue areas provide a first impression of eagle for travelers and tourists as the area is built out the urban context here will be a defining feature to the towns character response to growth and overall position in the region 4 because of the importance of these areas the overall objectives for development and design guidelines here should be to encourage an overall continuity of commercial and industrial parcel development to present a favorable image of the community when viewed both along i70 and from within the areas and to encourage longterm quality private investment activity 5 a positive longrange impact to eagles quality of life and tax base can be encouraged here by standards that require consideration of the immediate context of chambers avenue and the character of the area at large although the areas will include traditional commercial and industrial uses the areas can have a positive enduring character site planning and architectural styling site planning of commercial pads should be considerate of the likely layout of future abutting parcel development the number and location of curb cuts along chambers avenue should be included in site plan review parking layout and its visual and functional impact on adjacent parcel utilization will be a very important consideration in addition to the enforcement of site landscaping requirements the use of indigenous trees and the requirement when possible of larger sizes will help establish an attractive context here for future development activity in addition architectural design that reflects a mountainstyle and celebrates the use of local materials and building details should be strongly encouraged overall parcel development should be planned to fit in rather than stand alone consideration should also be given during site plan review of the visual effect of the proposed development both along i70 and from chambers avenue ultimately the areas will be successful if site planning design and vehicular movement can encourage visitors and residents to partake in several services during a single visit and be motivated to return b chambers avenue commercial zone area parcels zoned commercial general cg have a high visibility along chambers avenue

commercially zoned land north of the i70 interchange the area comprises a linear strip of land with approximately 112 miles of i70 frontage steeper pastureland north of this area limits future commercial development activity this area is completely separated physically and visually from the developed town by the i70 corridor because of its hillside backdrop and location development here would have less of an impact to the community if treated sensitively than if these uses occurred downtown because larger commercial parcels with municipal service infrastructure are available there will be considerable pressure for development activity here it is very possible that this area will develop completely independent of other trends in the town and be more influenced by county and regional market forces commercial activity may over time compete with downtown eagle as the commercial center of the area because of its likely development with commercial activities featuring high volumes of user traffic master planning of large parcels should be strongly encouraged careful consideration to the layout of curb cuts along existing public roads should be given to the extent

limited for commercial uses of limited size and impact which serve the daily or convenience needs of the residents in the neighborhood 2 us highway 6 is the historic state highway access that connects various developed segments of the county along the eagle river valley the highway parallels the river and its occasional river crossing provides dramatic views of the corridor at several points along its alignment in the town the area consists of private land mostly commercial zoned along both sides of the road commercial activity historically consisted of small service facilities catering to the traveler with the development of the i70 corridor many of the older commercial structures have been converted to serve more localized uses or are underutilized as the residential population of the county expands this corridor will face convenience and service commercial expansion guidelines here should focus on retaining the rural architectural style in place and require careful consideration

oriented businesses purpose and description a the purpose of this chapter is to allow the reasonable location of sexually oriented businesses within the town in a manner which will protect property values neighborhoods and residents from the potential adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses while providing to those who desire to patronize sexually oriented businesses such opportunity in appropriate areas within the town it is not the intent of this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment to the united states constitution but to impose content neutral regulations which address the adverse secondary effects that sexually oriented businesses may have on adjoining properties b it has been determined and reflected in the land use studies of various us cities that businesses which have as their primary purpose the selling renting or showing of sexually explicit materials have negative secondary impacts upon surrounding businesses and residences the experience in other us cities is that the location of sexually oriented businesses significantly increases the incidence of crimes especially sex offenses including sexual assault indecent exposure lewd and lascivious behavior and child molestation c it has been determined and reflected in the land use studies of various us cities that sexually oriented businesses in business districts which are immediately adjacent to and which serve residential neighborhoods have a deleterious effect on both the business and the residential segments of the neighborhood causing blight and downgrading of property values d it is the intent of these regulations to allow sexually oriented businesses to exist within the town in various dispersed locations rather than to allow them to concentrate in any one business area it is further the purpose of these regulations to require separation requirements between sexually oriented businesses and residential uses churches parks and educational institutions in an effort to buffer these uses from the secondary impacts created by sexually oriented business activity definitions unless otherwise defined in this section terms used in this chapter pertaining to sexually oriented businesses shall be as defined in the following words terms and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning business means and includes a sexually oriented business as defined in special use permit required a

property line of another sexually oriented business residentially zoned or used property church park day care center or educational institution b waiver criteria in establishing the provisions of this section the board of trustees hereby finds and determines that there may be exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions which are applicable to properties within the town or to the intended uses of properties within the town that do not generally apply to the property or class of uses in the same zone district and such that denial of an application for relief would result in an inability to reasonably utilize property therefore it is necessary to provide for such extraordinary relief in the form of a waiver in reviewing such applications for waivers the burden shall be upon the applicant to meet the criteria set forth in this section 1 a waiver to the separation requirements set forth in this section may be granted as a part of the special use review process if the presumptions in overcome by proof that the establishment of a sexually oriented business within 1000 feet of another sexually oriented business establishment or establishment of a sexually oriented business within 1000 feet of any residential zone district residential use park church or educational institution as applicable will not have a deleterious effect on surrounding residential and business areas by creating blight downgrading of property values or tending to cause an increase in crime 2 in granting a waiver to the separation requirements the planning commission or board of trustees may impose reasonable conditions relating to hours of operation screening buffering and signage as long as the conditions imposed are not designed to prohibit the dissemination of protected

perform an act which he is physically capable of performing if that conduct is all that is required for commission of a particular offense or if an offense or some material element thereof does not require a culpable mental state on the part of the actor the offense is one of strict liability if a culpable mental state on the part of the actor is required with respect to any material element of an offense the offense is one of mental culpability  construction of sections with respect to culpability requirements a when the commission of an offense or some element of an offense requires a particular culpable mental state that mental state is ordinarily designated by use of the terms intentionally with intent knowingly willfully recklessly or criminal negligence or by use of the terms with intent to defraud and knowing it to be false describing a specific kind of intent or knowledge b although no culpable mental state is expressly designated in a section defining an offense a culpable mental state may nevertheless be required for the commission of that offense or with respect to some or all of the material elements thereof if the proscribed conduct necessarily involves such a culpable mental state c if a section provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense that element also is established if a person acts recklessly knowingly or intentionally if recklessness suffices to establish an element that element also is established if a person acts knowingly or intentionally if acting knowingly suffices to establish an element that element also is established if a person acts intentionally d when a section defining an offense prescribes as an element thereof a specified culpable mental state that mental state is deemed to apply to every element of the offense unless an intent to limit its application clearly appears  principles of criminal culpability a if the criminality of conduct depends on a child being younger than 18

particular mental state essential to commission of the offense  2 the section defining the offense or any section relating thereto expressly provides that a factual mistake or the mental state resulting therefrom constitutes a defense or exemption  or 3 the factual mistake or the mental state resulting therefrom is of a kind that supports a defense of justification as defined in this title b a person is not relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in that conduct under a mistaken belief that it does not as a matter of law constitute an offense unless the conduct is permitted by one of the following 1 a statute or ordinance binding in this state  2 an administrative regulation order or grant of permission by a body or official authorized and empowered to make such order or grant the permission under the laws of the town and the state  3 an official written interpretation of the ordinance or law relating to the offense made or issued by a public servant

conduct is charged to constitute an offense because it causes or threatens bodily injury consent to that conduct or to the infliction of that injury is a defense only if the bodily injury consented to or threatened by the conduct consented to is not harmful or the conduct and the injury are reasonably foreseeable hazards of joint participation in a lawful athletic contest or competitive sport or the consent established a justification under this title c unless otherwise provided by this title or by the law defining the offense assent does not constitute consent if 1 it is given by a person who is legally incompetent to authorize the conduct charged to constitute the offense  2 it is given by a person who by reason of immaturity mental disease or mental defect or intoxication is manifestly unable and is known or reasonably should be known by the defendant to be unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the nature or harmfulness of the conduct charged to constitute the offense  3 it is given by a person whose consent is sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense  or 4 it is induced by force duress or deception d any defense authorized by this section is an affirmative defense  criminal attempt a a person commits criminal attempt if acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of an offense he engages in conduct constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the offense a substantial step is any conduct whether an act omission or possession which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actors purpose to complete the commission of the offense factual or legal impossibility of committing the offense is not a defense if the offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be nor is it a defense that the crime attempted was actually perpetrated by the accused b a person who engages in conduct intending to aid another to commit an offense commits criminal attempt if the conduct would establish his complicity under the offense committed by the other person even if the other is not guilty of committing or attempting the offense c it is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the defendant abandoned his effort to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission under circumstances manifesting the complete and
