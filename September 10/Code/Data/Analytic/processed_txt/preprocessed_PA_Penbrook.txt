commonwealth their resources and the environment inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues 111 editors note adopted on  revised 942013 penbrook borough codes version 20201 federal and state

maintenance agreement penbrook borough codes version 20201 penbrook borough codes version 20201 appendix b low impact development practices low impact development practices alternative approaches for managing stormwater runoff natural hydrologic conditions may be altered radically by poorly planned development practices such as introducing unneeded impervious surfaces destroying existing drainage swales constructing unnecessary storm sewers and changing local topography a traditional drainage approach of development has been to remove runoff from a site as quickly as possible and capture it in a detention basin this approach leads ultimately to the degradation of water quality as well as expenditure of additional resources for detaining and managing concentrated runoff at some downstream location the recommended alternative approach is to promote practices that will minimize postdevelopment runoff rates and volumes which will minimize needs for artificial conveyance and storage facilities to simulate predevelopment hydrologic conditions forced infiltration is often necessary to offset the loss of infiltration by creation of impervious surfaces the ability of the ground to infiltrate runoff depends upon the soil types and its conditions preserving natural hydrologic conditions requires careful alternative site design considerations site design practices include preserving natural drainage features minimizing impervious surface area reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces and protecting natural depression storage a welldesigned site will contain a mix of all those features the following describes various techniques to achieve the alternative approaches preserving natural drainage features protecting natural drainage features particularly vegetated drainage swales and channels is desirable because of their ability to infiltrate and attenuate flows and to filter pollutants however this objective is often not accomplished in land development in fact commonly held drainage philosophy encourages just the opposite pattern  streets and adjacent storm sewers typically are located in the natural headwater valleys and swales thereby replacing natural drainage functions with a completely impervious system as a result runoff and pollutants generated from impervious surfaces flow directly into storm sewers with no opportunity for attenuation infiltration or filtration developments designed to fit site topography also minimize the amount of grading on site protecting natural depression storage areas depressional storage areas have no surface outlet or drain very slowly following a storm event they can be commonly seen as ponded areas in farm fields during the wet season or after large runoff events traditional development practices eliminate these depressions by filling or draining thereby obliterating their ability to reduce surface runoff volumes and trap pollutants the volume and releaserate characteristics of depressions should be protected in the design of the development site the depressions can be protected by simply avoiding the depression or by incorporating its storage as additional capacity in required detention facilities penbrook borough codes version 20201 avoiding introduction of impervious areas careful site planning should consider reducing impervious coverage to the maximum extent possible building footprints sidewalks driveways and other features producing impervious surfaces should be evaluated to minimize impacts on runoff reducing the hydraulic connectivity of impervious surfaces impervious surfaces are significantly less of a problem if they are not directly connected to an impervious conveyance system such as storm sewer two basic ways to reduce hydraulic connectivity are routing of roof runoff over lawns  and reducing the use of storm sewers site grading should promote increasing travel time of stormwater runoff and should help reduce concentration of runoff to a single point in the development routing roof runoff over lawns roof runoff can be easily routed over lawns in most site designs the practice discourages direct connections of downspouts to storm sewers or parking lots the practice also discourages sloping driveways and parking lots to the street the routing of roof drains and crowning the driveway to allow runoff to discharge to pervious areas is desirable as the pervious area essentially acts as a filter strip reducing the use of storm sewers by reducing the use of storm sewers for draining streets parking lots and backyards the potential for accelerating runoff from the development can be greatly reduced the practice requires greater use of swales and may not be practical for some development sites especially if there are concerns for areas that do not drain in a reasonable time the practice requires educating local citizens and public works officials who expect runoff to disappear shortly after a rainfall event reducing street widths street widths can be reduced by either eliminating onstreet parking or by reducing cartway widths municipal planners and traffic designers should encourage narrower neighborhood streets which ultimately could lower maintenance and maintenance related costs limiting sidewalks to one side of the street a sidewalk on one side of the street may suffice in lowtraffic neighborhoods the lost sidewalk could be replaced with bicyclerecreational trails that follow backoflot lines where appropriate backyard trails should be constructed using pervious materials using permeable paving materials these materials include permeable interlocking concrete paving blocks or porous bituminous concrete such materials should be considered as alternatives to conventional pavement surfaces especially for low use surfaces such as driveways overflow parking lots and emergency access roads reducing building setbacks reducing building setbacks reduces driveway and entry walks and is most readily accomplished along lowtraffic streets where traffic noise is not a problem penbrook borough codes version 20201 constructing cluster developments cluster developments can also reduce the amount of impervious area for a given number of lots the biggest savings is in street length which also will reduce costs of the development cluster development clusters the construction activity onto lesssensitive areas without substantially affecting the gross density of development in summary careful consideration of the existing topography and implementation of a combination of the abovementioned techniques may avoid construction of costly stormwater control measures other benefits include reduced potential of downstream flooding reduced water quality degradation of receiving streams and water bodies enhancement of aesthetics and reduction of development costs beneficial results include more stable baseflows in receiving streams improved groundwater recharge reduced flood flows reduced pollutant loads and reduced costs for conveyance and storage penbrook borough codes version 20201 streets and sidewalks history adopted by the
