workforce demographics and large minority population the residents ofspringfield should be part of and benefit from public construction projectsin the city of springfield therefore it is appropriate for the city of springfield to require that each public construction project as definedherein include employment opportunities for springfield residents minorities women and veterans with the ordinance codified in this article further as the city finds and determines thattaxpayer money is most efficiently and productively spent by awardingconstruction contracts to firms that include and enforce provisions requiring compliance with state laws governing the payment of prevailingwages the city council hereby finds and determines that it is appropriatefor it to exercise entrepreneurial discretion by requiring firms that are awarded such contracts to comply with this article because a failure tocomply is injurious to the life health and happiness of individuals employedby such firms and is deleterious to the quality of life in the city where most of such individuals reside as enacted on  a on  the city of springfield passed for the purpose of setting forth certain compliance standards for public works construction contracts  and b since the enactment of said ordinance the city of springfield hasengaged in further review and consideration of the contracting which has highlighted the need to reexamine and further revise these contracting guidelines to better ensure they serve their intended purpose comport with applicable federal and state law and serve the best interests of springfield  and c the city of springfield like many states and localities across the unitedstates faces critical infrastructure needs that are substantial in scope and that must be addressed which will require the city of springfield toplan manage and oversee major capital investments in both the shortand long term  and d securing successful delivery of public works projects is extremelydifficult due to the unique complex unpredictable and inherentlydangerous nature of the construction industry wherein errors in project planning or execution can result in serious health and safetyrisks to project workers andor the general public unnecessary costoverruns flawed or inferior projects and disruptions in schedules that delay the use of critical government facilities  and e the city of springfield recognizes that the planning and execution ofsuch public works projects involves the exercise of essential police   8244 springfield code  8245 powers to protect and promote public health safety and welfare andconstitutes one of the most important obligations springfield has to its citizens because such projects require substantial taxpayer investmentsand are necessary to the effective performance of vital governmentfunctions  and f the city of springfield has commissioned and is in receipt of findingsfrom an updated disparity study which illustrates a level of disparityin the city of springfield and now wishes to revise its procurement standards for public works construction contracts to address thesefindings and considerations and increase employment opportunities forspringfield residents minorities veterans and women now based on that study  8245 definitions for the purpose of this article the words set out in this section shall have the
