district boundary lines  2583 variances a reasons for variances the zoning board of appeals has the authority to vary or modify the strict letter of the zoning law where a literal interpretation would cause practical difficulties area variances or unnecessary hardships use variance b applicability and limitations 1 the zoning board of appeals can decide appeals from a person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the officer 2 the zoning board of appeals may reverse affirm or modify special use permit decisions made by the permitting board utilizing the variance procedure 65 3 the zoning board of appeals has absolutely no power to amend the zoning law and must exercise great care to ensure that its rulings do not in effect amend the zoning law c basis for granting area variances 1 area variances provide relief of a dimensional nature eg lot shape or grade and must be based on practical difficulty the burden of proof is on the applicant and if relief is warranted it should be the minimum necessary 2 the following five 5 determinations must be considered in order to decide if practical difficulty is present a how substantial the variation is in relation to the requirements of the zoning law b the effect of the proposal on increased population density and governmental facilities eg fire water etc c whether a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood or a detrimental effect on adjoining properties would take place d whether the difficulty can be eliminated by some other reasonable alternative other than a variance eg add room to the other side of the house e will justice be served in allowing the variance 3 the fact that the practical difficulty was selfimposed does not disqualify the applicant from being granted an area variance 4 if a property owner will suffer significant economic injury by strict interpretation of the area standards and practical difficulties are present then the area variance can only be denied based on health safety or general welfare reasons d basis for granting use variances 1 use variances provide relief to an applicant who is denied of the zoning law by the municipal board the right to use land or structures in a certain manner since the use is not listed as an allowable use in the zoning law in order to be granted the use variance the applicant must prove that unnecessary hardship exists and this is accomplished by showing all of the following a the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return if used only for a purpose allowed in the district this does not mean that profits will necessarily be maximized b the use requested by the variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and be detrimental to properties in the vicinity c the plight of the applicant is due to unique circumstances and not to the general conditions on the neighborhood 2 in the case of a use variance it the hardship is selfimposed then the variance should generally speaking be denied an example of this would be the purchase of property which is not appropriate for the proposed use e in granting any variance the zoning board of appeals shall prescribe and conditions that it deems to be necessary or desirable and are in compliance with the intent of the zoning law the decisions must be written in the form of a resolution and must state in detail the reason for granting or denying the variance and the conditions imposed f temporary variances the zoning board of appeals may issue for uses which are of a temporary nature a variance said variance shall clearly state the conditions of the variance to include when it shall terminate the possibility of renewal and other conditions deemed necessary g flood variances 1 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 2 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense  create nuisances  cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in 3 which follows  or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 66 3 in passing upon such applications the zoning board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this local law and a the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others b the danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage c the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner d the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community e the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable f the availability of alternative location for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage g the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development h the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program of that area i the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles j the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site k the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems and streets and bridges 4 conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf  acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level provided that  25 79g3a k has been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond the onehalf  acre the technical
