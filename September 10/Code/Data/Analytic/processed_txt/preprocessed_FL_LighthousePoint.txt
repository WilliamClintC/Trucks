landscape planning and to the analysis of the whole in terms of form and function as it relates to aesthetics and composition color materials and decorations it includes scale in relationship to scale of adjacent buildings and landscape it applies to inner character of the individual project it applies in the same manner to alterations and advertising on the project building the fact that the area contains other unsightly buildings shall not constitute a valid reason not to comply with the requirements in this article b proper design construction concerns design of all work in its details the use of weather resistant material etc applies also to advertising poorly designed work must always be discouraged c appropriate to surroundings does not mean uniformity in style or subordination to existing buildings and landscape but rather an orderly relationship with landscape and nature other buildings and open areas again scale and composition are important particularly as to adjacent properties surroundings are not only the existing buildings and landscape within a neighborhood but future surroundings must also be weighed advertising signs on buildings must be appropriate to the surroundings in the same way d scale the character of any architectural work is determined both in its internal space and in its external volume by the fundamental factor of scale the relation between the dimensions of a building and the dimensions of a person every building is qualified by scale e space the experience of space a characteristic of architecture has its extension in the city in the streets squares alleys and parks in the playgrounds and in the gardens wherever the built or natural environment has defined or limited a void and so has created an enclosed space if in the interior of a building space is defined by six planes floor ceiling and four walls this does not mean that a void enclosed by five planes instead of six  as for example a roofless courtyard or public square cannot be regarded with equal validity as space all urban space wherever the view is screened off whether by stone walls or rows of trees or embankments presents the same features we find in architectural space every building creates two kinds of space its internal space completely defined by that building and the others around it and its external space all objectsbridges fountains groups of trees walls and in particular the facades of buildings are brought into play in the creation of urban space f proportion means the relation of one portion to another or to the whole or of one thing to another as respects to magnitude quantity or degree and ratio g garish means too bright or gaudy  showy glaring  also cheaply brilliant or involving excessive ornamentation or advertisement  2999 minimum design criteria a general criteria 1 any plan for a proposed structure or project must be in conformity with good taste good design and in general the structure or project must contribute to the image of the city as a place of beauty spaciousness harmony taste fitness broad vistas and high quality 2 the proposed structure or project must be in its exterior design and appearance of a quality such as not to cause the nature of the local environment or evolving environment to materially depreciate in appearance and value 3 buildings or structures which are part of a present or future group or complex shall have a unity of character and design the relationship of forms and the use texture and color of materials shall be such as to create a harmonious whole when the area involved forms an integral part of is immediately adjacent to or otherwise clearly affects the future of any established section of the city the design scale and location of the site shall enhance rather than detract from the character value and attractiveness of the surroundings 4 buildings or structures located along strips of land or on single sites and not part of a unified multibuilding complex shall strive to achieve visual harmony with the surroundings if they are built in undeveloped areas the two primary requirements shall be met express proper design construction and show proper design concepts to the city 5 all facades visible to public or adjacent property shall be designed to create a harmonious whole materials shall express their function clearly and not appear as a material foreign to the rest of the building 6 the structure must be harmonious with the surroundings to be harmonious it must not be inferred that buildings must look alike or be of the same style harmony can be achieved proper consideration of scale proportions site planning landscaping materials and color 7 lookalike buildings are not permitted unless in the opinion of the board there is sufficient separation to preserve the aesthetic character of the present or evolving neighborhood this is not to be construed to prohibit duplication of floor plans and exterior treatment in a planned development when in the opinion of the board the aesthetics of the development depend upon or are enhanced by the lookalike buildings and their relationship to each other 8 buildings which are of symbolic design or which have symbolic exterior facade or roof colors unless otherwise compatible with the criteria herein will not be approved by this board symbols attached to buildings will not be allowed unless they are secondary in appearance to the building and landscape and are an aesthetic asset to the building project and neighborhood 9 exterior lighting may be used to illuminate a building and its grounds for safety purposes but in an aesthetic manner lighting is not to be used as a form of advertising in a manner that is not compatible to the neighborhood or in a manner that draws considerably more attention to the building or grounds at night than in the day lighting following the form of the building or part of the building will not be allowed if in the opinion of the board the overall effect will be garish or detrimental to the environment all fixtures used in exterior lighting are to be selected for functional and aesthetic value 10 building surfaces walls and roofs that are considered garish by the board will be denied approval 11 take out or pick up windows or retail establishments shall not be located on a building facade that faces a public rightof way provided however the board may when in its judgment such windows are designed in such a manner as to be an aesthetic asset to the building and neighborhood permit the windows to face a public rightofway 12 all external forms attached or not to buildings shall be in conformity to and secondary to the building they shall be an asset to the aesthetics of the site and to the neighborhood 13 all telephones vending machines or any facility dispensing merchandise or a service on private property shall be confined to a space built into the building or buildings or enclosed in a separate structure compatible with the main building 14 no advertising will be allowed on any exposed amenity trash containers or benches unless such bench advertising has been permitted by the city commission b signs the aesthetic quality of a building or indeed of an entire neighborhood is materially affected by achieving visual harmony of the signs on or about a structure as they relate to the architecture of the building or the adjacent surroundings in addition to the limitations on signs imposed by chapter 42 article v signs of this there are certain aesthetic considerations which must be met 1 the scale of the sign must be consistent with the scale of the building on which it is placed or painted 2 the overall effect of the configuration or coloring of the sign shall be one of proper design concept and shall be aesthetically pleasing the colors shall not conflict with other signs already on the building or in the immediate vicinity 3 the intent of signage is to represent the identification of the primary business purposes conducted on the site signage shall be designed so as to represent an identification of services or products c exterior space the scale of exterior space is to be relative to its neighborhood adjacent properties buildings access roads and pedestrian routes and its activity building facades enclosing a space must be harmonious where because of their use or age like facades are not possible consideration should be given to unifying the walls of the space by the application of landscaping or manmade objects of like design at modular spacing the floor of a space is of primary importance its materials texture and color contour and shadow on it are to be considered not only in relation to the space but to its setting careful consideration shall be given to the preservation of natural vistas which open into open areas d landscaping emphasis shall be placed upon landscaping as a means of achieving beauty in the community it will be required on all projects  in some projects and areas it will be the primary tool available the city contains subtropical vegetation and characteristics with diverse areas of native plants and terrain to serve as guides and models for all landscaping plans landscape design and planning shall be integrated with the overall area design concept and not be considered merely as an afterthought toward this end proposed landscaping schemes will be evaluated as to their relationship to the existing natural landscape developed and other proposed landscape including those on adjacent properties and street rightofway and the building or buildings existing and proposed 1 the existing natural landscape shall be preserved whenever possible as an example of this in an area containing a stand of trees the developer shall preserve as many of these trees as possible and further landscape in a complementary manner rather than destroy the existing trees and replant with a type of vegetation foreign to the immediate natural environment existing vegetation must be indicated on the landscape plan protection of the existing vegetation during construction is required 2 landscaping includes not only trees and planting but paving benches fountains exterior lighting fixtures fences and any other item of exterior furniture all items of the landscape are to be selected not only for their functional value but for their aesthetic value and must complement the whole 3 one of the uses of landscaping will be to screen which means the masking out or concealment of any visually objectionable area the achievement of this is left to the designer whether by walls fences mounds of earth or vegetation it must be complementary to the whole as outlined above screening shall be employed to mask from the public view of adjacent properties such service areas as trash and garbage areas outside equipment of unaesthetic character and accessory buildings or areas not enhancing or in keeping with the aesthetics of the project or neighborhood screening of air conditioning units and other mechanical equipment shall be accomplished in a manner that does not interfere with the proper operation andor maintenance of such equipment 4 landscaping shall be designed in such a manner as to impart its aesthetic character when viewed from any area accessible to the public or from adjacent properties this is to include view from highrise structures and bridges 5 landscaping of existing properties whenever the exterior of an existing structure is structurally altered in any manner landscaping shall be upgraded unless it already meets current requirements or unless in the opinion of the board such upgrading is impractical or would result in undue hardship the developer has the burden of proving that any requirement imposes such an undue hardship in this case the board reserves the right to waive such portions of the criteria as it deems advisable e parking lots and vehicular use areas 1 parking lots and other vehicular use areas are to be designed as an aesthetic asset to a neighborhood and to the building group of buildings or facility they serve a parking lot is to be considered an outside space a transitional space which is experience between the access such as roads and the building group of buildings or other outside spaces which it serves the parking lot because it is viewed from above as well as at eye level should be designed accordingly 2 parking lots vehicular use areas and their parked vehicles are to be effectively screened from the public view and from adjacent property and in a manner that is attractive and compatible with safety the neighborhood and facilities served 3 the atmosphere within the parking lot and vehicular use area is to be parklike rather than the harsh hardstand of paving trees are of primary importance in the landscape they are not to be minimized in either height or quantity the tree imparts especially in a relatively flat area a sense of threedimensional space it casts shadows that reduce the monotony of the expanse of paving and creates a refuge from the tropical sun signs designating entrances exits and regulations are to be of a tasteful design and subject to review by the board the pavement is to be more than wall to wall asphalt it is recommended that pavement be varied in texture or color designating lanes for automobile traffic pedestrian walks and parking spaces bright colored pavement is to be used only with restraint in order to create a pleasant atmosphere it is recommended that consideration be given to sculpture fountains gardens pools and benches design emphasis is to be given to the entrances and exits to the lot trash refuse and unaesthetic storage and mechanical equipment should be screened from the parking lot 4 lighting is to be designed not only from the standpoint of safety and resistance to vandalism but for the visual effect it should avoid any annoyance to the neighbors from brightness or glare it should not impart a prisonlike atmosphere low lights of a modest scale can be used along with feature lighting emphasizing plants trees barriers entrances and exits the fixtures are to be selected not only for their functional value but for their aesthetic qualities they are to be considered furniture of the parking lot visible both day and night 5 landscaping of parking lots and vehicular areas shall comply with all city codes f existing code provisions it is intended that subsections b signs d landscape or e parking lots and vehicular use areas shall not replace any existing code provisions but merely be read in conjunction with any such code provisions and address the aesthetics of the situation g areas of particular note 1 intracoastal waterway and interior canals the intracoastal waterway a natural northsouth thoroughfare has two main inherent attributes one is the natural vistas from parks bridges and other points of public access the second is the imparting of an aesthetic experience together with an insight into the basic character of the city when traversing the waterway with its winding and varied width course the same applies to the various interior canals throughout the city therefore buildings within view of the waterway or canals must present to such waterway or canals their facade of greatest or equal to greatest importance all accessory buildings and facilities shall be screened from the public view or designed to the standards of the adjacent buildings 2 us highway no 1 us highway no 1 is presently our major northsouth artery of interurban traffic even though us highway no 1 has a diversity of zoning and uses and consequently a variety of form all projects shall meet criteria of the general requirements the importance of site planning and landscaping is stressed on this road in order to reduce the chances of the undesirable features of overadvertising and confusion and to develop an identity to the natural landscape and desired character of the city 3 lighthouse drive lighthouse drive is considered to be a main route of northsouth traverse city it acts as a connector entrance and exit and views from it impart an insight into the atmosphere of the city it is therefore felt that areas seen from this route even though of a varied use from residential to commercial must be developed in a manner that seeks to reflect the herein tone sought to be established for the community buildings shall be designed with major considerations given to forms facades roof coverings and landscaping the facade of greatest importance or one of an aesthetic equal shall be presented to these routes general requirements covering structure landscaping and exterior spaces shall also pertain individual site landscaping is to be encouraged but it is necessary that it be relative to future city plans for public rightofway 4 sample road this is the city main eastwest artery development or renovations along this route should have a pleasing form although there are some older existing buildings this fact should not deter the board from insisting on current compliance for all new construction this will stimulate new pride in ownership and future development 5 ne 49th street ne 39th street ne 27th street and ne 24th street these streets are as is sample road main eastwest arteries the same observations can be made of the development on these streets as of sample road which is that construction shall be made to conform to the criteria of this article  2999   9112000   appeals a should any application to the board

assessment to fund the provision of fire protection services by the city the city intends to utilize the uniform method for the levy and collection of special assessments as provided in fs   and  as those provisions set forth a fair and reasonable procedure to levy and collect special assessments that ensures proper notice and adequate due process to affected parties and provides for the cooperation between the city and other governmental entities toward the collection and use of data providing notice to affected parties and ensuring the collection of proceeds for use by the city it is not the intent of the city to create any additional due process rights other than those set forth in fs   and  to the extent any provisions in this article conflict with those statutory provisions the aforementioned statutes shall prevail  691998 findings of special benefit the city specifically finds that the provision of fire protection service by the city provides the requisite special benefit to real property within the city to justify the funding of fire protection services special assessment as the provision of fire protection services possesses a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of real property by 1 protecting the value of improvements and structures upon real property  2 lowering the cost of insurance upon real property including but not limited to fire insurance  3 protecting the public safety  and 4 enhancing the value of real property both commercial and residential  691998 authority a the city commission is authorized to fund all or any portion of the costs of providing fire protection services within the city by imposing an annual fire protection special assessment upon benefitted real property within the city based upon the special benefit received by such property from the provision of such service b the city commission shall impose the fire protection assessment pursuant to the procedures set forth in this article c the amount of the fire protection assessment imposed upon a particular parcel of real property within the city shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the assessed costs of providing fire protection services among the specially benefitted properties such methodology shall be set forth by separate resolution duly adopted by the city commission as provided in this article d no fire protection assessment shall be imposed upon governmental or institutional properties whose uses are wholly exempt from ad valorem taxation under state law as those uses provide services and benefits to the public and the city which might otherwise need to be provided and funded by the city the city commission finds that the benefits derived by the city and its residents from such uses provide a benefit to the city that are no less than the benefits these properties receive from the provision of fire protection services by the city hence it is fair and reasonable not to impose the fire protection assessment upon governmental or institutional properties whose uses are wholly exempt from ad valorem taxation  691998 definitions the following
