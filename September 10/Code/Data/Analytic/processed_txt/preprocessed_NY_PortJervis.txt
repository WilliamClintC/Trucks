a utility is defined for the purpose of the tax as including every person subject to the supervision of the department of public service and every other person furnishing utility services it is intended to include persons and corporations which are directly in competition with ordinary utilities such as landlords and submeterers who buy their services from other utilities and in turn resell such services for that reason the tax is imposed on receipts from sales to ultimate consumers receipts from the sale of such utility services to submeterers are not taxed but receipts of submeterers from their own customers are intended to be taxed any other construction would result in a complete exemption from taxation of utility services sold or furnished by this particular method furthermore it is believed that submeterers have common characteristics that distinguish them from other businesses and justify the conclusion that the method character and nature of their business in this aspect is substantially similar to the business of an ordinary utility and requires similar treatment for purposes of the tax this conclusion is strongly fortified by the fact that such landlords and submeterers are in direct competition with ordinary utilities and hence should bear similar tax burdens in order to avoid inequality of treatment  47511 definitions as used in this article the

from publications such as report to the american center for law and  53512 port jervis code  53513  justice on the secondary impacts of sex oriented businesses produced by peter hecht phd of the environmental research group and adult uses and the first amendment zoning and nonzoning controls on the use of land for adult businesses by steve mcmillen of pace university law school and also on the findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses 198 state of minnesota the council finds that 1 adultoriented businesses are unavoidably associated with unlawful unhealthy and detrimental activities ancillary to the constitutionally protected speech activities of such businesses 2 employees of adultoriented businesses engage in or may be requested to engage in sexual behavior as a result of the type of business by which they are employed 3 people present in the vicinity of an adultoriented business are often assumed by third parties to be engaged in or amenable to the types of unlawful unhealthy and detrimental activities ancillary to such businesses as a result such persons are subjected to unwanted advances or attention by persons frequenting such adultoriented business 4 people who choose not to frequent adultoriented businesses tend to avoid areas in which such businesses locate as a result areas in which adultoriented businesses locate often become dead zones ie areas in which owners of nonadultoriented businesses tend to choose not to locate in the first instance or choose to migrate away from because of diminished pedestrian traffic due to the presence of adultoriented businesses 5 because nonadultoriented businesses tend not to locate near or migrate away from adultoriented businesses the presence of one such business tends to attract other adultoriented businesses into the dead zone thereby increasing the pace and intensity of the unlawful unhealthy and detrimental activities unavoidably associated with such businesses and contributing to the blighting of the area surrounding such businesses the smaller the municipality including the city the larger the effects of a dead zone because the zone encompasses a larger proportion of the municipalitys businesses than a similar zone would in a larger city 6 due to the small geographical area of the city of port jervis the probability increases that adultoriented businesses will have substantial effects upon residential areas within the city further smaller municipalities including the city are more likely to have fewer days and hours of commercial activity than a larger city this increases the likelihood that an adultoriented business will have a larger effect on the area in which it is located during the off hours of nonadultoriented businesses  53513 wireless telecommunications  53513  7 sexual acts including masturbation occur at adultoriented businesses especially those which provide enclosed rooms booths or other cubicles for viewing of films videos or live sex shows thereby creating unhealthy and unsanitary conditions within the premises of such businesses 8 the constitutionally protected speech activities presented at adultoriented businesses often encourages sexual activities thereby creating unhealthy and unsanitary conditions 9 some patrons frequent adultoriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in specified sexual activities within the premises of such businesses thereby creating unhealthy and unsanitary conditions within the premises of such businesses 10 communicable diseases may be spread by specified sexual activities including but not limited to transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv and the contraction of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids hepatitis b and venereal diseases 11 venereal diseases hiv aids and hepatitis b as well as other communicable diseases spread by specified sexual activities are serious health concerns in the local community 12 sanitary conditions in some adultoriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities engaged in by some patrons of such businesses and the failure of some business owners and operators to selfregulate those activities and maintain the business premises 13 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen and other bodily fluids are found in certain areas of adultoriented businesses particularly where persons view in enclosed rooms booths or other cubicles adult materials or entertainments characterized by an emphasis on nudity or specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas 14 prohibiting the viewing in enclosed rooms booths or other cubicles of adult materials or entertainments characterized by an emphasis on nudity or specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas is the least restrictive means available effectuating the legitimate and contentneutral legislative goal of preventing adultoriented businesses from being operated and used in a unhealthy unsafe and unsanitary manner facilitating the transmission of communicable diseases or otherwise degrading the public welfare health comfort and safety further such a prohibition imposes a relatively minor imposition on the operating prerogatives of the owners of adultoriented businesses compared to other means such as mandating adultoriented businesses inspect such cubicles and directing the frequency and form of such  53513 port jervis code  53513  inspections requiring adultoriented businesses to hire employees whose duties are dedicated to monitoring such cubicles and conducting increased numbers of police and public health and safety inspections of such businesses 15 adultoriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the substantial governmental concerns raised by the various findings herein while permitting patrons and owners of such businesses to engage in constitutionally protected speech activities 16 the presence of adultoriented businesses is associated with declining property values 17 the presence of adultoriented businesses is associated with increased crime rates against both property and persons 18 children and teenagers are more likely to be exposed to graphic sexual images because of the presence of adultoriented businesses 19 because persons patronizing adultoriented businesses often travel a significant distance to such businesses these persons tend not to share with city residents the concerns for the quality of life in the city consequently persons from outside the city patronizing such businesses tend to place an inordinate strain on city services and facilities such as parking usage of city streets and trash collection and removal 20 the presence of adultoriented businesses tends to alter the character of the community in which they are located and quality of life for the residents of such community the city is presently in the process of undergoing a transformation altering both the character and quality of life in the city the alterations to character and quality of life associated with the presence of adultoriented businesses are at odds with the goals of the transformation the city is undergoing and consequently the failure to properly regulate adultoriented businesses could undermine this process 21 the citys intent in regulating adultoriented businesses is not to restrict constitutionally protected speech activities but rather to provide constitutionally sufficient alternate avenues for persons to engage in such activities in a manner consistent with the constitutions of the united states and new york state while addressing the unlawful unhealthy and detrimental activities ancillary to such speech and ameliorating these secondary effects on the peace good order commercial viability and safety of city residents and nonadultoriented businesses 22 the general welfare health comfort and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this section  53513 wireless telecommunications  53513  b purpose 1 the primary purposes of this section are as follows a to preserve the character and quality of the life of the citys neighborhoods and business and maintain the viability of the citys ongoing process of transformation  b to control the documented adverse secondary effects that are ancillary to adultoriented businesses as set forth in including decreased property values  attraction of transients  parking and traffic problems  increased crimes against persons and property  loss of business for surrounding nonadultoriented businesses  and deterioration of neighborhoods  c to maintain property values  d to prevent crime  e to safeguard the continued commercial viability of currently existing nonadultoriented businesses  f to ensure
