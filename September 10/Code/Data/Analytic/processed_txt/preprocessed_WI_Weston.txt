equivalent to the frontage of a rectangularly shaped lot of the same depth this method is declared and found to be a more equitable assessment method than the simple front footage method the adjusted front footage method gives consideration to the depth and shape as well as frontage on the street improved the plat example in figure 1 illustrates how the method is used in practice figure 1 taxation

clearly indicates a different meaning actual front footage means the actual length of a lots property lines abutting a public improvement and measured as described in legal documents deeds certified survey maps subdivision plats or other public land survey records adjusted front footage means the front footage of a lot after making allowances for lot shape and size in accordance with this special assessment policy the adjusted front footage may be greater or less than the actual front footage assessable front footage means the front footage upon which the assessment will be levied the assessable front footage will usually be the same as the adjusted front footage however in cases such as those involving corner lots which were previously assessed on one side or where a lot may have received a partial assessment the assessable front footage can differ from the adjusted front footage  1 amended via 182015 amended via 262019 the adjusted front footage formula throughout this section 150 feet will be used as the denominator for purposes of explaining the application of the formula 1 oddshaped lots for oddshaped lots such as found on culdesacs or triangular intersections etc the adjusted front footage is computed by dividing the area of the lot up to a maximum distance of 150 feet from the street where the improvement is to be installed by 150 when the adjusted front footage formula is applied and results in an adjusted front footage which is greater than the actual front footage then the assessable front footage shall be the adjusted front footage 2 approximately rectangular lots for a lot which is approximately rectangular the adjusted front footage is computed by averaging the front and back sides of the lot if the lot is deeper than 150 feet the width at the 150foot depth is used for the back lot line this method is limited to where the divergence between the front and rear lot lines is five feet or less 3 rectangular lots for the normal rectangular lot the adjusted front footage is the actual front footage of the lot using the 150foot denominator 4 shallow lots for rectangular lots under 150 feet in depth the adjusted front footage is determined by dividing the actual lot area by 150 feet taxation and special assessments  5 neck lots for lots which have a small frontage on a street with a narrow strip running back 150 feet more or less an adjusted front footage is determined by dividing the actual lot area by 150 feet 6 corner lots the adjusted front footage for corner lots shall be based on the first side improved if both sides are improved the adjusted front footage shall be based on the long side on lots where property lines meet with an arc the front footage shall be computed as half the arc measurement at the property line the adjusted front footage will further take into account the lot shape as described in this section where one side has been previously improved and assessed and the second side is improved an assessment will be levied for the second side served if the lot could be divided along the second side to make another lot conforming to existing or potential zoning the adjusted front footage for the second side served in this case will be the adjusted front footage on the second side less 150 feet 7 double frontage lots see lot b in figure 1 a double frontage lot assessment is an exception to the rule its assessment shall be for the first side served the assessment shall be computed on the adjusted front footage method that conforms to the shape and size of the lot except that if the lot is capable of division on a line roughly parallel to either of the abutting streets into two or more lots upon which two or more principal buildings could be erected according to the regulations of the zoning district in which the lot is located the assessment shall then be for both sides when served and at the adjusted front footage formula as conforms to the size and shape of the resulting lots any variance that may be granted by the zoning board of appeals will be excluded from consideration in calculating lot division for purposes of assessment under this section 8 triple frontage lots triple frontage lots have characteristics of double frontage and corner lots a triple frontage lot will be considered the same as a double frontage lot 9 other cases meeting any of the specific criteria described in this section will be handled on a case by case basis  1 amended via 182015 of assessable front footage the assessable front footage is the frontage upon which the assessment will

the purpose of this section is to establish the basis for reasonable charges for the cost of collecting and treating domestic wastewater and industrial wastewater all revenues raised by the sewer service charges shall be utilized for payment of the cost of treatment sewerage system maintenance facility upgrades and replacements and debt service any revenue not spent in any budget year shall be placed in a nonlapsing account and carried forward to pay the next years expenses and to defer the need for rate increases 2 applicability a sewer service charge is imposed upon each lot parcel of land building or premises fronted by a public sewer andor served by wastewater facilities or otherwise discharging sewage including industrial wastes into the public sewerage and wastewater facilities a sewer service charge will not be imposed upon undevelopable land as determined by the village which is fronted by a pubic sewer main 3 annual review sewer service charges shall be reviewed periodically to determine their adequacy to offset the cost of treatment sewerage system maintenance facility upgrades and replacements and debt service charge costs accordingly the village reserves the right to adjust the sewer service use charges periodically to assure their continued adequacy 4 determination of charges a sewer service charges to all users will be based on a metered water volume from the village water meter when village water is the only source of wastewater discharged from the users premises into the sewerage system in addition there will be a surcharge for wastewater discharged with concentrations of bod5 tss tkn andor total phosphorus in excess of the concentrations defined in domestic wastewater b when a user discharging wastewater into the sewerage system is a user of water not supplied by the village the amount of water used shall be measured by a meter acceptable to the village or determined by the village in such manner and by such method as it may find practicable under the conditions and attendant circumstances of the case in order to determine the sewer service charge such determination may be appealed to the village as an alternative the village may establish a flat rate for sewer service or authorize the installation at the users expense of a control manhole with metering facilities c when a user utilizes metered water in an industrial process or for other purposes which prevents the discharge of all water purchased into the village sewerage system the user may be eligible for a proportionate sewer service charge reduction it shall be the responsibility of the user to install adequate metering facilities to properly identify all water not discharged into the sewerage system the village reserves the right to inspect all installations of this nature and may require the user to monitor the wastewater discharge volume to verify actual discharge rates d sampling of industrial wastewaters may be made on a regular basis or as needed to verify sewer service charges utilities  e each new industrial user shall file with the village an initial written statement for each separate connection to the sewerage system giving the daily volume surge rate peak rate pounds of tss pounds of bod5 pounds of total phosphorus and pounds of tkn of the wastewater initial sewer service charges shall be developed on the basis of this statement changes in operations or use shall be reported by the industrial user and it shall be the industrial users sole responsibility to have such changes made to the original statement to remain in compliance with this f the village may sample and test at any time any industrial wastewater discharge to verify the accuracy of any statement filed by an industrial user if the results of the wastewater tests indicate wastewater with measured parameters less than or equal to the values listed in the industrial users statement then the cost of the testing shall be at the villages expense if the results of the wastewater tests indicate wastewater with measured parameters more than 5% greater than the values listed in the industrial users statement then the cost of the testing shall be at the industrial users expense 5 billing frequency the sewerage utility will invoice users quarterly repealed recreated and renumbered via 212017 service charges and rates 1 purpose the purpose of this

targeted nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under wisconsin administrative nr   amended via 182015 renumbered via 212017 findings of fact the village of weston board finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature 2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants 3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads 4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading 5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities 6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes 7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding amended via 182015 renumbered via 212017 purpose and intent utilities  1 purpose the general purpose of this ordinance is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to a further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions b prevent and control the adverse effects of storm water  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound economic growth c control exceedance of the safe capacity of existing drainage facilities and receiving water bodies  prevent undue channel erosion  control increases in the scouring and transportation of particulate matter  and prevent conditions that endanger downstream property 2 intent it is the intent of the village of weston board that this ordinance regulates postconstruction storm water discharges to waters of the state this ordinance may be applied on a
