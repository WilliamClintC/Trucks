and zoning thirteen  building and housing fifteen  fire prevention s note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting enacts the codified ordinances

for promoting the health safety and general welfare of its citizens therefore the city council of lyndhurst state of ohio does ordain as follows bfindings of fact the city of lyndhurst has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base additionally structures that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss in order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth these regulations are adopted cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to 1protect human life and health  2minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3minimize the need

postconstruction scms the owner may request approval from the city engineer for the use of alternative structural postconstruction scms if the owner shows to the satisfaction of the city engineer that these scms are equivalent in pollutant removal and runoff flowvolume reduction effectiveness to those listed in table 5 if the site disturbs greater than five 5 acres or less than five 5 acres but is part of a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five 5 or more acres prior approval from the ohio epa is necessary to demonstrate the equivalency the owner must show athe alternative scm has a minimum total suspended solid tss removal efficiency of 80% using the level ii technology acceptance reciprocity partnership tarptesting protocol bthe water quality volume discharge rate from the selected scm is reduced to prevent stream bed erosion unless there will be negligible hydrologic impact to the receiving surface water of the state the discharge rate from the scm will have negligible impacts if the owner can demonstrate one of the following conditions 1the entire water quality volume is recharged to groundwater 2the development will create less than one acre of impervious surface 3the development project is a redevelopment project with an ultraurban setting such as a downtown area or on a site where 100% of the project area is already impervious surface and the stormwater discharge is directed into an existing storm sewer system 4the stormwater drainage system of the development discharges directly into a large river of fourth order or greater or to a lake and where the development area is less than 5% of the water area upstream of the development site unless a tmdl has identified water quality problems in the receiving surface

quantity control for each watershed in the development 1the peak discharge rate of runoff from the critical storm and all more frequent storms occurring under postdevelopment conditions shall not

 100 year for example if the percent increase between the pre and postdevelopment runoff volume for a 1year storm is 35% the critical storm is a 5year storm the peak discharge rate of runoff for all storms up to this frequency shall be controlled so as not to exceed the peak discharge rate from the 1 year frequency storm under predevelopment conditions in the development drainage area the postdevelopment runoff from all less frequent storms need only be controlled to meet predevelopment peak discharge rates for each of those same storms  cfor sites with less than one acre of disturbed land and not part of a common plan of development iif the postdeveloped flow for the critical storm is less than 110% of the predeveloped critical storm flow no stormwater quantity measures need to be
