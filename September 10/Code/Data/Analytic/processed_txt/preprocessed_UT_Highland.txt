in a tree after the workers leave the scene of operations tree removal standards street or park trees may be removed if the tree interferes with or creates a public nuisance or hazard to pedestrians or vehicular traffic and cannot be properly maintained to remove such hazard or is considered a public nuisance by the city forester  the tree severely interferes with the growth and development of a more desirable tree  the trees aesthetic value is so low that the site would be enhanced visually by its removal  the tree has been topped thus producing an unsound branching structure conducive to severe storm damage windthrow and accelerated death  the tree is not approved for planting in parking strips stump removal requirements and standards persons performing stump removal duties shall have the immediate area investigated for utility lines and bluestake as necessary and wear all required safety eye and ear protection all removal of public trees shall be done in a manner so that the remaining stump will be at least twelve inches below ground level unless special exemption is granted be the city forester excavation resulting from a tree or shrub removal must be promptly filled in to normal ground level with clean earth  the fill properly settled and free of debris tree protection and preservation purpose this standard is intended to guide city crews and private contractors in the protection of cityowned trees near construction public works or underground utility projects in compliance with highland city introduction the condition of a tree is an important factor in appraising a tree for its monetary value all people that work around trees are responsible to protect them from unnecessary injury that would decrease their value remember that tree roots spread two to eight times wider than the dripline of the canopy and that ninety percent of a trees roots are found in the top two feet of soil these facts illustrate why it is so important to use care when working around city trees general standards trees shall not be used to support any scaffolding signs temporary utility or any other device when grade change is required a retaining wall or dry well for drainage must be established at existing grade sidewalks and paving levels should be contoured whenever possible to avoid root cuffing any alterations to development plans that take place during the construction phase which impact trees must be coordinated with the city forester irrigation of the tree during construction and other pertinent issues must be addressed prior to the beginning of the construction phase if damage occurs to a protected tree immediate contact shall be made with the city forester in order that wounds can be treated tree protection zone trees to be preserved during construction activities shall have a tree protection zone tpz clearly marked with a continuous protective fence prior to any demolition stripping or clearing heavy equipment shall not be allowed inside the protected area all excavations shall be made by equipment from outside of the tpz building materials topsoil or fill shall not be stockpiled in the tpz or in the dripline of any tree that is scheduled to remain at a construction site prior to construction on public property the tpz will be designated by the city forester following coordination with other city departments the size and shape of the tpz will depend on the species sensitivity to impact health and age of the tree root and crown conformation and development constraints underground utility work trenching should be performed in a manner and location least damaging to tree roots tunneling or boring should be done whenever possible where large scaffold roots are encountered hand digging and bridging of roots shall be done any cutting of tree roots other than when in the process of tree removal shall give due consideration to future welfare of the tree proper action shall be taken as to protect preserve or correct the root problem trenching and tunneling near trees by the national arbor day foundation shall be used as a guide for all construction and excavation work around city trees this booklet may be obtained from the city forester excavation involving root cuts should be done rapidly cuts on tree roots shall be smooth and clean backfill before the roots have a chance to dry out and water tree

trees must have a current commercial or noncommercial pesticide applicators license and shall observe all safety requirements pertaining to licensed pesticide applicators including epa and the state of utah regulations for the application of pesticides the property owner may spray park strip trees himself only under the guidance of highland city ineffectual control damage injury or death of plants animals or persons resulting from the use of materials beyond the limitations of the manufacturers guarantee shall be considered the responsibility of the applicator if a spray machine is not capable of giving proper spray coverage to all portions of the infested or partially infested tree being treated it shall be considered inadequate to perform such operation spray equipment shall be kept clean and in good working order operation with dirty tanks or equipment or unsanitary unsafe methods of washing out or draining of same in public sewers and gutters is prohibited no spray application shall be carried out when the temperature is outside the range of forty to eightyeight degrees fahrenheit or when the wind velocity is greater than six mph all spray machines other than handpump sprayers must have agitators capable of maintaining a uniform spray suspension at all times when spray application is in progress adequate precautions shall be taken in all phases of spray application concerning factors of toxicity phytotoxicity chemical reaction or residual action pertaining to spray material used applicators applying pesticides to trees shall adhere to all state and federal regulations pertaining to pesticides and the safe and unobstructed passage of vehicles and pedestrians applying fertilizers and pesticides for pay is considered as commercial pesticide applications and does require a current license for such from the utah state department of agriculture highland city street tree selection guide trees are a valuable component of our city trees clean the air we breath muffle city noise harbor wildlife in their canopies cool houses with their dense shade and increase property values but perhaps most of all trees provide a natural beauty which softens the harsh city landscape trees truly enhance the quality of life for all unfortunately not all trees are properly planted and cared for growth characteristics including height spread and branching structure limit the usefulness of some trees in certain locations streets buildings and sidewalks also limit the space available for tree growth and must be considered when selecting a tree our goal should be to choose a tree that is well matched to the planting site so that it survives and becomes an asset to the community the trees in this guide are generally tolerant of local temperature extremes hardiness and have characteristics that make them useful as street trees all of the trees have been divided into classes dependent on the width height and spacing requirements that the trees will need at maturity these divisions are described as follows class i these are small trees which normally do not reach a large height or trunk diameter they can be planted beneath power lines and in parking strips down to four feet wide typical spacing between class i trees is twenty to thirty feet class ii these trees are usually considered medium sized trees and are normally planted for their shade and aesthetic contribution these trees are not for planting under power lines or in parking strips less than six feet wide typical spacing between class ii trees is thirty to forty feet class iii many of these trees are longlived and attain large height and trunk diameter when selecting a tree from this class be sure you have ample room to accommodate it at maturity these trees are not for planting under power lines or parking strips less than ten feet wide typical spacing between class iii trees is forty to sixty feet how to select a tree shade trees vary greatly in their growth characteristics many trees are wider than they are tall learning about a trees shape mature height and spread will help in selecting the right tree for the right place the idea is to first consider the planting site does the location have adequate irrigation are there any overhead wires how wide is the parking strip once the location has been considered it is then time to choose a tree from the list that will best fit the location each tree in the guide is listed with its common and botanical names followed by a short narrative with general information additional information is given about each tree in the following categories growth rate is a general estimate of the relative growth of trees as well as the lifespan of the tree species commonly available varieties discusses the varieties that work well in this area and that are recommended where to see describes the location of examples that are growing within the city it is recommended that trees be visited prior to planting so that you can see the tree at its mature size and get an idea as to what the tree will require in maintenance and growing space how to plant a tree the best way to insure a healthy and safe street tree is to start by planting the tree correctly there are only a few things to remember when planting the following are some planting tips that will help the tree off to a good start always pick up a tree by the container or root ball not by the trunk the hole should be dug as deep as the root ball and twice as wide digging the hole in this way will loosen soil so roots can grow only remove broken or dead branches do not apply fertilizer when planting it may burn tender roots water trees at least once a week and more frequently during hot weather where to plant a tree if you wish to plant a tree in a parking strip you are required to get consent from the city forester this is done to insure that trees have been matched to the site correctly and in order to schedule future maintenance by city pruning crews once a tree is planted in a cityowned parking strip it becomes city property pruning and other major maintenance of these trees is the responsibility of the parks and recreation department when planting a tree place plant the tree in the middle of the parking strip away from any known utility lines this will allow the maximum amount of growing space and will reduce the potential for damage in the future what not to plant there are some types of trees that have characteristics that are not suited to areas close to sidewalks buildings and streets these tree species are most suited for yards parks or other natural areas and should not be planted along city streets a list of trees not approved for planting along streets is found at the end of this guide to obtain additional information about services provided by the urban forestry division or planting trees please call the urban forestry office as new information becomes available the tree selection

protected by a permanent conservation easement prohibiting future development and setting other standards safeguarding the sites special resources from negative changes  print preview  195321 a natural open space areas although the locations of natural areas are predetermined by the locations of flood plains wetlands steep slopes and soils subject to slumping greater latitude exists in the designation of improved open space areas except that they shall include a 100foot deep green way buffer along all water bodies and watercourses and a 50foot green way buffer alongside wetlands soils classified as very poorly drained in the mediumintensity county soil survey of the usda natural resources conservation service b the location of open space areas shall be guided by the maps and policies contained in the land use element of the general plan the parks recreation and trails element of the general plan and parks master plan and shall typically include all or part of the following kinds of resources mature woodlands aquifer recharge areas with highly permeable excessively drained soil significant wildlife habitat areas prime farmland historic archaeological or cultural features listed or eligible to be listed on national state or county registers or inventories and scenic views into the property from existing public roads open space areas therefore typically consist of meadows forest pastures and farm fields part of the ecologically connected matrix of natural areas significant for wildlife habitat water quality protection and other reasons c general location standards i subdivisions shall be designed around both the natural and improved open space areas which together constitute the total required open space the design process should therefore commence with 1 the delineation of all potential open space 2 where potential house sites are located 3 access road alignments are identified and 4 lot lines drawn in 1 both natural and improved areas shall be placed in undivided preserves which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of the development 2 undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practical number of lots within a conservation subdivision to achieve this the majority of house lots should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access safe and convenient pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided except in the case of farmland or other resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human disturbance where the undivided open space is designated as separate noncontiguous parcels no parcel shall consist of less than three 3 acres in area nor have a lengthtowidth ratio in excess of 4 to 1 except in areas that are specifically designed as village greens ballfields upland buffers to wetlands waterbodies buffers watercourses or trail links d interconnected open space network e as these policies are implemented the protected open spaces in each new subdivision will eventually adjoin each other ultimately forming an interconnected network of natural and open space areas across the city  print preview  196321 f evaluation criteria i in evaluating the layout of lots and open space the following criteria will be considered by the planning commission as indicating design appropriate to the sites natural historic and cultural features and meeting the purposes of this ordinance diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and open space areas accordingly the planning commission shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan 1 protects and serves all floodplains wetlands and steep slopes from clearing grading filing or construction except as may be approved by the city for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities 2 preserves and maintains mature woodlands existing fields pastures meadows and orchards and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses for example locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended with two exceptions the first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands that raise an equal or greater preservation concern as described in items below the second involves predominantly agricultural areas where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat 3 if development is to be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils or in locations at the far edge of a field as seen from existing public roads other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads such as by planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees shrubs and wildflowers specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow 4 maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural species vegetation of at least 50 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters including creeks streams springs lakes and ponds 5 designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or meadows and minimize impacts on large woodlands greater than five acres especially those containing many mature trees or significant wildlife habitat also woodlands of any size or highly erodible soils with slopes greater than 10% should be avoided however woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development when any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas for buildings roads yards septic disposal fields etc in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas to the fullest extent that is practicable  print preview  197321 6 leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted particularly as seen from public thoroughfares for example in open space agrarian landscapes a deep nobuild noplant buffer is recommended along the public thoroughfare where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant the concept of foreground meadows with homes facing the public thoroughfare across a broad grassy expanse is strongly preferred to mere buffer strips with or without berms or vegetative screening in wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained a deep nobuild nocut buffer should be respected to preserve existing vegetation 7 avoid siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topographic features 8 protect wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered threatened or of special concern by the us environmental protection agency and the utah state division of wildlife

minimized so that those resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development to the greatest extent practicable this land shall be designed as a single block with logical straight forward boundaries long thin strips of conservation land should be avoided unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails the open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels such as in other subdivisions public parks or properties owned by or

development shall be consistent with the policies contained in the land use element of the general plan and with the recommendations contained in this section and the following section evaluation criteria 1 open space shall be comprised of two types of land primary conservation areas and secondary conservation areas all lands within both primary and secondary conservation areas are required to be protected by a permanent conservation easement prohibiting future development and setting other standards safeguarding the sites special resources from negative changes a primary conservation areas this category consists of wetlands lands that are generally inundated under ponds lakes creeks etc land within the 100year floodplain slopes exceeding 25% and soils subject to slumping these sensitive lands are deducted from the total parcel acreage to produce the adjusted tract acreage on which density is based for both conventional and conservation subdivisions b secondary conservation areas in addition to the primary conservation areas at least fifty percent 50% of the remaining land shall be designated and permanently protected full density credit shall be allowed for land in this category that would otherwise be buildable under local state and federal regulations so that their development potential is not reduced by this designation such density credit may be applied to other unconstrained parts of the site  print preview  2050 c although the locations of primary conservation areas are predetermined by the locations of flood plains wetlands steep slopes an soils subject to slumping greater latitude exists in the designation of secondary conservation areas except that they shall include a 100 foot deep green way buffer along all water bodies and watercourses and a 50foot green way buffer alongside wetlands soils classified as very poorly drained in the mediumintensity county soil survey of the usda natural resources conservation service d the location of secondary conservation areas shall be guided by the maps and policies contained in the land use element of the general plan and the parks recreation and trails element of the general plan and shall typically include all or part of the following kinds of resources mature woodlands aquifer recharge areas with highly permeable excessively drained soil significant wildlife habitat areas prime farmland historic archaeological or cultural features listed or eligible to be listed on national state or county registers or inventories and scenic views into the property from existing public roads secondary conservation areas therefore typically consist of meadows forest pastures and farm fields part of the ecologically connected matrix of natural areas significant for wildlife habitat water quality protection and other reasons although the resource lands listed as potential secondary conservation areas may comprise more than half of the remaining land on a development parcel after primary conservation areas have been deducted no applicant shall be required to designate more than 50% of that remaining land as secondary conservation area e general location standards i subdivisions shall be designed around both the primary and secondary conservation areas which together constitute the total required open space the design process should therefore commence with the delineation of all potential open space after which potential house sites are located following that access road alignments are identified with lot lines being drawn in as the final step this fourstep process in further described in b6 below ii both primary and secondary conservation areas shall be placed in undivided preserves which may adjoin housing areas that have been designed more compactly to create larger areas that may be enjoyed equally by all residents of the development iii undivided open space shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable number of lots within a conservation subdivision to achieve this the majority of house lots should abut undivided open space in order to provide direct views and access safe and convenient pedestrian access to the open space from all lots not adjoining the open space shall be provided except in the case of farmland or other resource areas vulnerable to trampling damage or human disturbance where the undivided open space is designated as separate noncontiguous parcels no parcel shall consist of less than three 3 acres in area nor have a lengthtowidth ratio in excess of 4 to 1 except in areas that are specifically designed as village greens ballfields upland buffers to wetlands waterbodies or watercourses or trail links  print preview  2150 f interconnected open space network i as these policies are implemented the protected open spaces in each new subdivision will eventually adjoin each other ultimately forming an interconnected network of primary and secondary conservation areas across the city to avoid the issue of taking of land without compensation the only elements of this network that would necessarily be open to the public are those lands that have been required to be dedicated for public use never more than 10% of a development parcels gross acreage and typically configured in a linear fashion as an element of the citys long range open space network  print preview  2250 g evaluation criteria i in evaluating the layout of lots and open space the following criteria will be considered by the planning commission as indicating design appropriate to the sites natural historic and cultural features and meeting the purposes of this ordinance diversity and originality in lot layout shall be encouraged to achieve the best possible relationship between development and conservation areas accordingly the planning commission shall evaluate proposals to determine whether the proposed conceptual preliminary plan ii protects and serves all floodplains wetlands and steep slopes from clearing grading filing or construction except as may be approved by the city for essential infrastructure or active or passive recreation amenities iii preserves and maintains mature woodlands existing fields pastures meadows and orchards and creates sufficient buffer areas to minimize conflicts between residential and agricultural uses for example locating house lots and driveways within wooded areas is generally recommended with two exceptions the first involves significant wildlife habitat or mature woodlands that raise an equal or greater preservation concern as described in items #5 and #8 below the second involves predominantly agricultural areas where remnant tree groups provide the only natural areas for wildlife habitat iv if development must be located on open fields or pastures because of greater constraints in all other parts of the site dwellings should be sited on the least prime agricultural soils or in locations at the far edge of a field as seen from existing public roads other considerations include whether the development will be visually buffered from existing public roads such as by planting screen consisting of a variety of indigenous native trees shrubs and wildflowers specifications for which should be based upon a close examination of the distribution and frequency of those species found in a typical nearby roadside verge or hedgerow v maintains or creates an upland buffer of natural species vegetation of at least 100 feet in depth adjacent to wetlands and surface waters including creeks streams springs lakes and ponds vi designs around existing hedgerows and treelines between fields or meadows and minimize impacts on large woodlands greater than five acres especially those containing many mature trees or significant wildlife habitat also woodlands of any size or highly erodible soils with slopes greater than 10% should be avoided however woodlands in poor condition with limited management potential can provide suitable locations for residential development when any woodland is developed great care shall be taken to design all disturbed areas for buildings roads yards septic disposal fields etc in locations where there are no large trees or obvious wildlife areas to the fullest extent that is practicable vii leaves scenic views and vistas unblocked or uninterrupted particularly as seen from public thoroughfares for example in open space agrarian landscapes a deep nobuild noplant buffer is recommended along the public thoroughfare where those views or vistas are prominent or locally significant the concept of foreground meadows with homes facing the pubic thoroughfare across a broad grassy expanse is strongly preferred to mere buffer strips with or without berms or vegetative screening in wooded areas where the sense of enclosure is a feature that should be maintained a deep nobuild nocut buffer should be respected to preserve existing vegetation  print preview  2350 viii avoid siting new construction on prominent hilltops or ridges by taking advantage of lower topographic features ix protect wildlife habitat areas of species listed as endangered threatened or of special concern by the us environmental protection agency and the utah state division of wildlife x designs around and preserve sites of historic archaeological or cultural values and their environs insofar as needed to safeguard the character of the feature including stone walls spring houses barn foundations cellar holes earthworks and burial grounds xi protects rural roadside character and improves public safety and vehicular carrying capacity by avoiding development from coming directly onto existing public roads establishes buffer zones along the scenic corridor of rural roads with historic buildings stone walls hedgerow and so on xii landscapes common areas such as community greens culdesac islands and both sides of new streets with native specie shade trees and flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value deciduous shade trees shall be planted at fortyfoot intervals on both side of each street so that the neighborhood will have a stately and traditional appearance when they grow and mature these trees shall generally be located between the sidewalk or foot path and the edge of the street within a planting strip no less than five feet in width xiii provides active recreational areas in suitable locations that offer convenient access by residents and adequate screening from nearby house lots xiv includes a pedestrian circulation system designed to assure that pedestrians can walk safely and easily on the site between properties and activities or special features within the neighborhood open space system all roadside footpaths should connect with offroad trails which in turn should link with potential open space on adjoining undeveloped parcels or with existing open space on adjoining developed parcels where applicable xv provides open space that is reasonably contiguous fragmentation of open space should be minimized so that those resource areas are not divided into numerous small parcels located in various parts of the development to the greatest extent practicable this land shall be designed as a single block with logical straightforward boundaries long thin strips of conservation land should be avoided unless the conservation feature is linear or unless such configuration is necessary to connect with other streams or trails the open space shall generally abut existing or potential open space land on adjacent parcels such as in other subdivisions public parks or properties owned by or leased to private land conservation organizations such subdivision open space shall be designed as part of larger contiguous greenway systems as per the policies of the land use element of the general plan and the parks recreation and trails element of the general plan 54408 site planning procedures the sequence of actions prescribed for open

with existing or recent owners of the property and members or the planning commission and city council iii location of house sites during the second step potential house sites are tentatively located because the proposed location of houses within each lot represents a significant decision with potential impacts on the ability of the development to meet the evaluation criteria subdivision applicants shall identify tentative house sites on the preliminary plan and proposed house sites on the detailed final plan house sites should generally be located not closer than 100 feet of primary conservation areas but may be situated within 50 feet of secondary conservation areas but may be situated within 50 feet of secondary conservation areas in order to enjoy views of the latter without negatively impacting the former the building footprint of proposed residences may be changed by more than fifty feet in any direction with approval of the planning commission changes involving less
