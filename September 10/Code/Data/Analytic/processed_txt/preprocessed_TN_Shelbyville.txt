must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards for new and existing sources set out in 40 cfr chapter i subchapter n parts 405471 and shall serve as the minimum requirements a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the control authority may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with  810025e and f as allowed at 40 cfr 4036c b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the control authority may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to the individual industrial users as allowed at 40 cfr 4036c2 c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the control authority shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with tennessee rule 1200414065 d a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following subsections of this section as allowed at 40 cfr 40315 i categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of subsection ii of this section are met ii criteria a either change 9  888 1 the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr chapter i subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or 2 the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in absence of pollutants in the intake waters b credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod5 total suspended solids tss and oil and grease shall not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere c credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring at the persons applying for credit expense may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section d credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the board may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result e when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the board convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the control authority the board may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in subsections 5eia e below i to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge or general permit  change 9  889 b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits ii an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the control authority whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than twenty percent 20% from its baseline production rates determined in subsection 5eic of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the control authority will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to subsection 5eia of this section as long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit iii when developing equivalent mass limits the control authority a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average change 9  890 standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to subsection 10 the industrial user must also be in compliance with  810133 regarding the prohibition of bypass d the control authority may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the control authority when converting such limits the control authority will use the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited in  8100210 of this chapter see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the control authority will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 e once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this  810025 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived f many categorical pretreatment standards specify one 1 limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second for calculating monthly average or four 4 day average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation change 9  891 g any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the control authority within two 2 business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the control authority of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate 6 modification of national pretreatment standards if the potw system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by the national pretreatment standards the board may apply to the approval authority for modifications of specific limits in the national pretreatment standards consistent removal shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the potw system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent whish is achieved by the system in ninetyfive percent 95% of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in 40 cfr section 4037a3ii part 403  general pretreatment regulations for existing and new
