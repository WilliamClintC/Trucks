historic architecture and should be of their own time buildings also should be of high quality and enduring value so that in the future they are as revered as the landmark buildings in the rest of downtown while the design standards and guidelines do not encourage the replication of historic structures they do promote compatibility with the character of existing buildings in downtown standard a plastic or backlit awnings shall not be used while the use of more traditional awning materials and forms is encouraged the width and height of awnings shall be related to the window openings and

to provide locations along strategic regional arterial corridors for shopping centers and business uses that draw patrons from st charles surrounding communities and the broader region the br district
