coastal wetlands or the transitional zone of coastal wetlands  findings of facts the board of commissioners finds that the discharge of nonstormwater drainage to waters of the state and to the municipal storm drainage system could have significant adverse impact upon health safety and welfare of the community more specifically 1 illicit stormwater discharges carry pollutants into receiving water bodies degrading water quality and effect in closures of shell fishing water 2 a nutrient such as phosphorus or nitrogen accelerates eutrophication of receiving waters adversely affecting flora and fauna 3 improper connection to the storm drain system and to waters of the state adversely impacts quality of receiving waters 4 septic tank discharges from noncompliant systems washing machine discharges and illegal dumping into the stormwater drains are examples of illicit discharges 5 the town must have the authority to deter andor stop illicit discharges to stormwater drains and ditches 6 substantial economic losses result from these adverse impacts on community waters 7 illicit discharges to water bodies diminish their capacity to naturally process runoff nutrients thereby harming flora and fauna 8 increase of illicit discharge to waters can percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater quality 9 improperly managed stormwater systems can decrease the quality of property and human life 10 improperly managed stormwater drainage systems can interfere with the maintenance of optimum estuarine areas and biological productivity 11 many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with an illicit stormwater discharge ordinance  objectives a the purpose of this article to provide for the health safety and general welfare of the people

number of the key districts for the town of wake forest are ordered and classified according to the ruralurban transect the transect is a method of classifying the natural and built environments as a continuum of six conditions ranging from rural to urban the value of the transect is that it classifies development form with the appropriate land use and development context for example a rural street typically has no curbs or sidewalks and its buildings are often irregularly spaced an urban street depending on the intensity of urbanism may have curbs and gutters regularly placed street trees sidewalks and building forms that are more regular in form and spacing each urban zoning category has detailed provisions for the mix of uses building type density height street design the design of parks and open space the mix of uses building design parking streetscape and other aspects of the human environment in order to implement the intent of this ordinance there are hereby created several base districts with the designations and general purposes listed under each and the specifically permitted uses special uses dimensional standards and permitted building types included each base district has a corresponding conditional district designation which shall be administered in accordance with natural & rural areas the transect begins with two areas that are rural in character the natural area which is made up of lands protected in perpetuity as natural recreational or agricultural areas  and the rural area which includes areas of high agricultural scenic or environmental value that should be protected suburban area the transition area between countryside and town is called the suburban area this area consists primarily of single family homes although this area is primarily a residential area it may have other development types such as schools and other civic uses general urban area general urban development is primarily residential but more urban in character having a higher density with a mix of housing types and a greater mix of uses including neighborhoodserving commercial uses urban center area at the more urban end of the spectrum is the urban center area this can be a small neighborhood center or a larger villagetown center the latter serving more than one neighborhood urban core area the urban core or downtown serves not only adjacent neighborhoods but the entire town and the region while it is typically the central business district where the greatest mix of uses occurs the historic character and location of wake forests

the erosion of soil from unstabilized development sites has adverse impacts on the condition of public and private property impairs the town of wake forest stormwater system and causes pollution and accelerated siltation of lakes streams and other watercourses pursuant to the north carolina sedimentation pollution control act of 197 as amended the town of wake forest has been directed to implement an erosion and sedimentation control program as outlined in this chapter b flood damage prevention the flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of the town of wake forest are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses can be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards c stormwater management it has been determined that development and redevelopment can alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding soil erosion stream channel erosion nonpoint and point source pollution and sediment transport and deposition as well as reducing groundwater recharge these changes in stormwater runoff contribute to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and alterations in hydrology which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment these effects can be managed and minimized by applying proper design and wellplanned controls to manage stormwater runoff from development sites further the federal water pollution control act of 1972 clean water act and federal phase ii stormwater rules promulgated under it as well as rules of the north carolina environmental management commission promulgated in response to federal phase ii requirements compel certain urbanized areas including the town of wake forest to adopt stormwater controls such as those included in this chapter d watershed protection the legislature of the state of north carolina has in ncgs 14321 watershed protection rules directed local governmental units to adopt regulations that meet or exceed the minimum requirements of ncgs 143 2145 and water supply watershed protection rules adopted by the state environmental management commission in order to protect the water supplies throughout the state  purpose a erosion and sedimentation control the erosion and sedimentation control regulations of this chapter are adopted for the purposes of regulating certain landdisturbing activities to control accelerated erosion and sedimentation in order to control water pollution from sedimentation inhibit the accelerated erosion and sedimentation of lakes and watercourses and prevent damage to public and private property by erosion and sedimentation 12 erosion flood stormwater & watershed standards 121 general purpose and intent 122 town of wake forest nc b flood damage prevention 1 it is the purpose of this section to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions within the flood prone areas by provisions designed to a restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion flood heights or velocities  b require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  c control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  d control filling grading dredging and all other development that may increase erosion or flood damage  and e prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 2 specific objectives of the flood damage prevention provisions are as follows a to protect human life and health  b to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  c to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  d to minimize prolonged business losses
