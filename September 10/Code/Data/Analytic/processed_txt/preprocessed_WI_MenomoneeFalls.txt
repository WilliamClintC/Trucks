performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under nr   wis adm o09  2 61509 findings of fact the village board of trustees finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can 1 degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature  2 diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants  3 alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads  4 reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading  5 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainage ways and other minor drainage facilities  6 threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes  7 undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding  and 8 aggravate excessive infiltration and inflow of water into sanitary sewer connections during peak storm events causing the conveyance system to surcharge overflow or backup into basements o09  2 61509

subdivision iii  cluster developments conservation development district cdd a intent the purpose of the cdd is to preserve natural resource areas and other large areas of open land while permitting residential development at low densities in an open space setting located and designed to reduce the perceived intensity of development and provide privacy for dwellings specific objectives are as follows 1 to maintain and protect the villages character by preserving important landscape elements including those areas containing unique and sensitive natural features such as woodlands hedgerows stream corridors wetlands floodplains shorelands steep slopes critical species habitat and natural areas by setting them aside from development 2 to allow singlefamily residential development on lots with private wells and sewage systems where it can be determined that the proposed development will not adversely affect water wells in the area 3 to minimize views of new development from existing streets 4 to provide for the unified and planned development of parcels 35 acres or larger in size for clustered low density residential uses incorporating large areas of permanently protected common space 5 to provide for greater design flexibility in the siting of dwellings and other development features than would be permitted by the application of standard district regulations in order to minimize the disturbance of rural landscape elements scenic quality and overall aesthetic value of the landscape 6 to create groups of dwellings with direct visual and physical access to common open space 7 to permit active and passive recreational use of common open space 8 to reduce erosion and sedimentation by retaining existing vegetation and minimizing development on steep slopes 9 to permit

the purpose of the pid planned infill development overlay zoning district is to provide regulations which govern the procedure and requirements for the review and approval or denial of proposed planned infill developments pids and to provide for the possible relaxation of certain development standards pertaining to the underlying standard zoning district b generally this pid overlay zoning district is intended to provide more incentives for redevelopment in areas of the community which are experiencing a lack of reinvestment furthermore this pid overlay zoning district is designed to forward both aesthetic and economic objectives of the village by controlling the site design and the appearance density or intensity of development within the pid overlay zoning district in a manner which is consistent with sound land use urban design and economic revitalization principles the application of these standards will ensure longterm progress and broad participation toward these principles c specifically planned infill developments pids are intended to provide incentives for infill development and redevelopment in terms of more flexible requirements for land uses density intensity bulk landscaping and parking requirements in exchange for such flexibility the pid shall provide a much higher level of site design architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than normally required for other developments d pids have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this chapter in addition to such potential pids also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which potentially cannot be determined except with a binding site plan landscape plan and architectural plan and on a casebycase basis in order to prevent this from occurring all pids are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable only to pids

successful communities leverage their land use open space and transportation plans in a manner which creates a clear sense of scale transition and activity towards a hierarchy in strong and memorable community experiences the foundation of such a hierarchy is the creation of development districts that form a positive collective identity when viewed in total to achieve such a positive end result each district should have a unique character defined land use mix and physical design recognizing that the central portion of main street in their community lacked such a recognizable character and had regulations which might only compound this challenge the village of menomonee falls prepared a vision for the main street redevelopment area generally bounded on each side by the main streethighway 4145 interchange and the main streetpilgrim intersection this vision was prepared process infused with public input and calls for a collection of land uses positioned to provide a more sustaining mix of uses and activities than current development generally affords this area now known as the main street redevelopment district intends a rich tapestry of neighborhood identities encouraging new development and redevelopment 1 the community also recognizes that a key area along the freeway was lacking in a recognizable character and facing future changes to land use as older industrial structures become obsolete the village of menomonee falls prepared the northeast area neighborhood plan which was adopted as a component of the comprehensive plan for the village this vision was prepared process with public input and calls for a collection of land uses positioned to provide a sustaining mix of uses along the 4145 corridor this area is commonly referred to as the richfield way extension 2 in order to implement these visions the design standards affecting development are intended to be consistent with the vision behind their intent to accomplish this goal the main street redevelopment district has been subdivided into a series of development subdistricts and the development restrictions that will be necessary to achieve their collective individuality b purpose the purpose of these standards is to define the character of new development within each subdistrict and is intended to help create new development patterns that are consistent with the vision and recommendations of the village of menomonee falls comprehensive plan and main street redevelopment plan these guidelines have been written to define specific standards necessary towards the creation of a mixed use streetscapeoriented development they have been carefully designed to allow enough flexibility for creative building solutions while being prescriptive in areas necessary to preserve consistency the main street district requires c goals 1 encourage private investment in residential commercial and office developments  2 eliminate blighting influences  3 diversify the local economy base and job creation  4 create a wellplanned safe and healthful area  5 provide cleared and fully improved sites for mixed use projects to include residential commercial and office
