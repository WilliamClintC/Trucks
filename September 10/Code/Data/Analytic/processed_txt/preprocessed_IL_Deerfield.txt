signage mounted on a wall e 2 note dashed broken line used to indicate area included in computation of area of sign letters logos or other signage elements must be mounted directly onto the wall e 2 a area area is determined by drawing a single rectangle which encompasses all of the signage elements area gaps or spaces between any of the signage elements andor signage panels are included in the computation of the area of the sign area gaps or spaces created because of signage elements or signage panels located at varying heights are included in the computation of the area of the sign a8 decorative framing e 2 b decorative framing is considered a signage element it is a component of the sign which does not structurally support the other signage elements or signage panels for

elements are to be included within the rectangle andor a13 architectural  decorative framing e 3 a 4 example a architecturaldecorative ornamentation will be included in the computation of the area of

elements will be computed by finding the area of the smallest single rectangle which encompasses all of the signage elements see e3b 2 for exceptions for pedestal base reveal andor footing but if any signage elements are displayed or are in any way incorporated onto the pedestal base reveal or footing then the rectangle must be drawn to include the entire area upon which signage is mounted a17
