design standards is to provide for harmonious and aesthetically pleasing nonresidential and multifamily residential with the municipality and its environs and to promote a stable property tax base in those zoning districts within which mixed use development is permitted use of construction materials of similar context and value these standards are intended to encourage preservation and reuse of historic structures while facilitating the construction of new buildings and structures including corporate franchise prototypes in a manner which captures and embraces architectural elements commonly associated with new englands regional identity to the extent practicable these standards are not intended to discourage creativity and innovation rather the intent of this to encourage cooperation between public and private interests to the extent necessary in order to ensure a mutually acceptable outcome 3042 applicability the requirements of this be applicable to all applications for approval of nonresidential and multifamily residential site plans under these regulations in addition in those instances where an owner of an existing nonresidential or multifamily residential structure or building desires to make exterior architectural changes and where a requirement for site plan approval does not otherwise exist under of these regulations such property owner shall file an application with the planning board for architectural review under this involving routine maintenance repair inkind replacement of one or more architectural features that do not involve a change in design dimensions or materials are exempt from the requirements of this are not subject to architectural review by the planning board 3043 design standards applicable to districts other than the mixed use zoning district the following design standards shall apply for all proposed nonresidential and multifamily residential proposals in districts other than the mixed use zoning district muzd a in order to protect the aesthetic character of the community and to improve the quality of new development the design of building faades may be regulated at the discretion of the planning board b architectural design of all proposed buildings and structures in the opinion of the planning board must be consistent with or improve upon the architectural character of the neighborhood within which the subject site is situate c the roof form of proposed buildings and structures must be compatible with that of 86 adjacent structures where appropriate by duplicating the shape pitch and materials 1 a pitched roof should generally be provided on new structures having a building footprint of 12000 square feet or less 2 in the case of sites having multiple buildings structures or elements the roof form of the primary structure should be duplicated throughout whenever practical see figure 1 3 for structures with a footprint larger than 12000 square feet flat roofs may be permitted provided that a mansard roof style is employed see figure 2 4 varied offsets roof heights forms and window placement should be incorporated into all new structures or additions to existing structures see figure 3 5 refer to sample graphics below for examples regarding common roof form and mansard roofs common roof form graphic figure 1 87 mansard roof graphic for structures with footprints greater than 12000 sq feet  figure 2 varied offsets roof heights and window graphic figure 3 88 3044 design standards applicable to the mixed use zoning district in addition to those standards contained in the following additional criteria shall be required for all site plan applications proposed within the mixed use zoning overlay district  a general guidelines 1 recognizing that every property proposal and situation are unique  the planning board may waive or modify any of the standards specified herein as it reasonably deems appropriate based upon the individual circumstances no particular style is stipulated and innovative contemporary and distinctive designs may be permitted provided they are respectful of general design principles and context 2 it is recognized that many national and regional chain businesses seek to build a standard design across the country or region without regard to local conditions the planning board will evaluate proposed designs for compatibility with the district and for conformance with the purpose of these regulations 3 in general buildings shall be compatible with traditional new england architecture and should be articulated to express an architectural identity 4 in general buildings shall possess an overall integrity architectural details should not give the impression of being tacked on but rather integral to overall design as an example use of undersized shutters on a picture window or installation of an elaborate classical portico or cupola on an otherwise clearly utilitarian structure should be discouraged 5 reuse of existing structures that have special architectural historical cultural or contextual value is strongly encouraged 6 modifications and additions to existing buildings should be harmonious with the prevailing character of the existing building when the existing building is in general conformance with the goals of these regulations b design elements the purpose of these standards is to encourage architecture that draws its inspiration from traditional new england style building design should reinforce a humanscaled environment consideration of architectural forms massing detailing number and use of materials and color the planning board strongly encourages consideration of the following design elements 1 roofs monotony of design or warehouse style structures shall be avoided variation in detail form and siting shall be used to provide visual interest in order to prevent the construction of warehouse style buildings ie long horizontal roof lines all new buildings and additions should have pitched or gabled roofs where 89 practical shed gambrel and barn style roofs are also acceptable roofs should have appropriate overhangs and soffits the use of dormers is encouraged all rooftop mechanicalventilation equipment must be placed in such a manner so that it is not visible from public ways and adjacent properties this goal may be accomplished by using architectural treatmentcamouflaging walls parapets false chimneys etc or by other appropriate means 2 building materials exterior surfaces of buildings should be covered with traditional materials or products which simulate natural materials including but not limited to clapboards shingles stone or brick exposed masonry block corrugated steel and synthetic panels are not acceptable pitched roofs should be constructed of shingles standing seam metal or other materials traditionally used in this region 3 awnings brightly colored or illuminated franchise type awnings are not acceptable awnings may be made of transparent materials glass or clear plexiglas type products awning covers designed for shade should be made of fabric or simulated fabriclike material 4 architectural details balconies decks covered porches decorative shingles bracketed eaves columns balustrades towers turrets skylights and arches are among the details to be considered and encouraged all features and details should be in proportion to the building 5 windows windows should be incorporated on front and side facades to humanize the building it is preferable that windows be vertical with the vertical dimension exceeding the horizontal the use of large picturetype windows for firstfloor retail uses is strongly encouraged windows may be used for either interior illumination or for display purposes 6 entrances articulation of building entrances is encouraged use of a portico canopy awning sidelights surround or similar architectural feature 7 fencing fencing made of traditional new england materials is encouraged ie picket split rail wrought iron brick or stone chain link security fences may be allowed where appropriate but use of this material is generally discouraged 8 color subtle neutral colors should be used on larger plain buildings paint colors should relate to the natural colors of building materials such as brick stucco etc complimentary colors on architectural details are encouraged as are historic colors bright franchise colors are discouraged 90 performance guarantee requirements & construction procedures 3051 general requirements h pursuant to rsa  iii d the planning board may
