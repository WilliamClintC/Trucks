use of overthetop or frame ties to ground anchors this requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces b require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement c require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with zones a130 ah and ae on the communitys firm that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph four 4 of this section be elevated so that either 1 the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least two 2 feet above the base flood elevation 2 the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement 5 recreational vehicles trailers or motor homes placed on sites within zones a130 ah and ae on the communitys firm must meet one of the following criteria a be on the site for fewer than 30 consecutive days b be fully licensed and ready for highway use c meet the permit requirements of 040c1 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in paragraph four 4 of this section a recreational vehicle trailer or motor home is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions  print preview  144146 c standards for subdivision proposals 1 all subdivision proposals shall be consistent with this ordinance 2 all proposals for the development of subdivisions including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall meet the development permit requirements of 030 040and the provisions of 050 of this ordinance 3 base flood elevation data shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed development including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions greater than fifty 50 lots or five 5 acres whichever is lesser if not otherwise provided pursuant to 030b or 040b8 of this ordinance 4 all subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards form both surface water and groundwater 5 all subdivision proposals including the placement of manufactured home parks and subdivisions shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage  print preview  145146 d standards for areas of shallow flooding 1 located within the areas of special flood hazard established in 030b are areas designated as shallow flooding ao and ah zones these areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one 1 to three 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow  therefore the following provisions apply a all new construction or substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor including basement elevated at least two 2 feet above the base flood level b all new construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential structures 1 have the lowest floor including basement elevated at least two 2 feet above the base flood level 2 together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy c a licensed professional engineer shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this as proposed in 040c5 and 040c6 are satisfied d require within zones ah or ao adequate drainage paths around structures on sloping ground to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures 2 citys firm may also identify areas of shallow flooding hazards with an average depth less than on 1 foot deep shaded zone x as established in 030b these areas may be between the flood hazard boundaries defined for the 1  and 02percentchanceannual flood or associated with base flood depths less than one 1 foot where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity may be evident such flooding is generally characterized by sheet flow  therefore the following provisions apply a all new construction or substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures 1 all new construction or substantial improvements have the lowest floor including basement elevated above the estimated depth of the base flood and above the highest groundwater level that is anticipated to occur during periods of flooding 2 require within shaded x zones positive ground slopes away from structures and adequate drainage paths around structures on sloping ground to guide flood water around and away from proposed structures 3 a registered professional engineer shall submit certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this as proposed in 040c5 and 040c6 are satisfied  print preview  146146 e floodways floodways located within areas of special flood hazard established in 030b are areas designated as floodways since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions shall apply 1 encroachments are prohibited including fill new construction substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge 2 if 050a7 above is satisfied all new construction or substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of f standards for areas of special erosion hazard in order to prevent damage to structures in areas subject to special erosion hazards the following provisions shall apply 1 no structural development will be allowed to be constructed in an area of special erosion hazard unless the potential erosion hazards have been evaluated and mitigated and buildings meet minimum setback requirements in accordance with 050a2 2 no excavation or fill that could modify flood hazard boundaries defined on the firm shall be performed in areas of special erosion hazard without a grading permit in accordance with 050c7 3 no solid walls solid fences or other structures that could disrupt flowing water in an area of special flood hazard or special erosion hazard shall be constructed in a position or direction contrary to the direction of flowing water to create additional flooding and erosion hazards 050 penalties for violation a no structure or land shall hereafter be constructed located extended converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations b violation of the provisions of this ordinance by failure to comply with any of its requirements including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions shall constitute a class b misdemeanor in addition to any fine a violator shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case c nothing herein contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation enacted
