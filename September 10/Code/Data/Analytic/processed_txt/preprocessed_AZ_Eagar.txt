principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this title would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the eagar town council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this title are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate exh a part 2007   appeal board a the floodplain board of the eagar town council shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this title b the floodplain board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement decision or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this title c in passing upon such applications the floodplain board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this title and 1 the danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 the danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 the susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner  4 the importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 the necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 the availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 the safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 the expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 the costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water system and streets and bridges d upon consideration of the factors of subsection c of this section and the purposes of this title the floodplain board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this title e any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property  and 3 the land upon which the variance is granted shall be ineligible for exchange of state land pursuant to the flood relocation and land exchange program provided by ars title 26 a copy of the notice shall be recorded in the office of the apache county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land f the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to federal emergency management agency exh a part 2007   conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation provided the procedures of chapters 1616 and 1620 of this title have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  3 showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water this includes only facilities defined in of this title in the definition of functionally dependent use  and 4 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances exh a part 2007 title 17  subdivisions chapters subdivision regulations title and purposes a the ordinance codified in

businesses within the town the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material b findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the council and findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theaters inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theatres 426 us 50 1976 and barnes v glen theatre inc 501 us 560 1961 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theatres adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of sexually oriented businesses 6 at least fifty communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states six hundred in 198 two thousand two hundred in 198 four thousand six hundred in 198 eight thousand five hundred fiftyfive in 1985 and two hundred fiftythree thousand four hundred fortyeight  8 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with thirtythree thousand six hundred thirteen cases reported in 1982 and fortyfive thousand two hundred of 1990 9 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 10 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 11 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 12 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 13 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 14 the findings noted in subsections b1 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 15 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 16 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the town it is appropriate to require reasonable assurance that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 17 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 18 requiring licenses of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce in the incidences of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witness or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 19 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 20 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witness to such activity 21 the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 22 the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 23 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the town will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter exh a 572013   definitions as used in this chapter a adult arcade means any place to which the public is permitted

design guidelines a building and topography 1 policy a building should respect the natural topography of the site 2 guidelines and recommendations a step a building foundation to follow the slope fifteen percent or greater of the site when feasible i in general an exposed foundation should not exceed three feet in height b primary building entrance 1 policy a the primary entrance of a structure should orient to a street major sidewalk pedestrian way plaza courtyard or other public space 2 guidelines and recommendations a design the main entrance to be clearly identifiable i provide a sheltering element such as a stoop porch awning gable arcade or portico to signify the primary entrance to a building b orient the primary entrance of a building to face a street plaza or pedestrian way i focusing an entrance toward a parking lot without also addressing the street is not recommended ii consider using a doublefronted design where entrance to parking and to the street is encouraged that is provide a door to the street and another to the parking lot c street level interest 1 policy a when a building is located close to a street or walkway it should be designed to provide interest to pedestrians for example commercial buildings with storefronts are of interest to passerby while porches courtyards and decorative wall surfaces add interest to multifamily housing designs these features encourage pedestrian activity and should be used whenever feasible b the overall mass of a building should appear to be in scale with existing buildings this will help new structures fit in with the eagar context at the same time newer structures may be larger than seen before  they should simply be articulated in their form to compliment existing structures 2 guidelines and recommendations a develop the street level of a building to provide visual interest to pedestrians i provide visual interest with a display window providing views to activities in the building or a display case with exhibits where internal functions do not permit windows or a decorative wall surface such as a mural or sculptural feature ii a large expanse of blank wall is not recommended on a facade that faces a public way or a major pedestrian route iii avoid large panelized products or extensive featureless surfaces b for all buildings divide the buildings into modules that express traditional dimensions in general a primary facade plane should not exceed seventyfive feet in length if a building would exceed this dimension provide a jog in the facade to divide it into subordinate elements that will be less than seventyfive feet in length each the jog should be a minimum of twenty percent of the facade plane height c all buildings shall employ at least two of the following techniques i change materials with each building module to reduce the perceived mass  or ii change the height of a wall plane or building module the change in height shall be at least twenty percent of the vertical height  or iii change the roof form to help express the different modules of the building mass  or iv change the arrangement of windows and other facade articulation features such as columns or strap work that divide large wall planes into smaller components d roof form 1 policy a the primary roof form of a structure should help reduce the perceived scale of the building for that reason sloping roofs should be used in most contexts these also will help the building fit with the mountain backdrop 2 guidelines and recommendations a using sloping roof forms to reduce the perceived scale of a building is encouraged b any pitched roof should have a minimum of sixteeninch overhang eaves c recommended roof features i a flat roof with parapet flat roof is not a strong recommendation  ii a cornice or molding to define the top of a parapet  iii sloping roofs with a minimum pitch of   iv multiple roof planes e building materials 1 policy a materials that reduce the perceived mass of a building and appear to blend with the natural setting shall be used 2 guidelines and recommendations a the following are recommendations of building materials i log or log siding natural wood siding painted or stained wood lap or in shingle pattern where appropriate to the building use style and setting ii brick stone rusticated block or comparable modular masonry are preferred primary building materials color should be integral to the material iii new materials that convey the texture scale matte finish and color similar to masonry will be considered where appropriate iv stucco and its artificial derivatives when it is tinted earth tone colors and detailed to convey a sense of scale that is appropriate as a secondary building material ie on second floors or above other primary building materials reveal and scoring lines should be used to create panels that establish shadow lines and visual relief b materials that are highly reflective are inappropriate as primary materials i mirrored glass large expanses of metal panels or other shiny materials are not considered primary materials f service canopies 1 policy a a gas station service area should appear as a subordinate element in the site design b minimize the visual impacts of a service area canopy i use a low profile section for the canopy itself ii screen lights under the canopy iii break up mass of the canopy area by stepping the form of the canopy area by stepping the form of the canopy or by dividing it into a set of smaller individual canopies g color 1 policy a building finish colors should help a structure blend with the natural setting and reduce its perceived scale b colors with high chrome values should be kept to a minimum and used only as an accent 2 guidelines and recommendations a use muted colors and earth tones i this applies to roof materials as well ii the predominant color of exterior walls seen from a public way should be muted and earth toned iii where appropriate accent colors including high intensity and metallic colors may be used to break up the mass exh a 572013 variances purpose of provisions a the purpose of a variance is to
