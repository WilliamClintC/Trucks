therefore a necessary focus of any effort to improve the aesthetic quality of our environment b discarded nondegradable polystyrene remains persistent in the environment and endangers life and wildlife c chemical composition and ability of a substance to degrade are meaningful and useful criteria to focus upon when establishing public policy that is intended to reduce the cumulative impact of litter and encourage composting d no viable outlets exist for the recycling of polystyrene which would serve to encourage recycling of the material e certain retail establishments within manasquan are points of origin for polystyrene waste and therefore are necessary targets for actions which have the potential for reducing the entry of polystyrene into the environment f there are readily available paper product substitutes for polystyrene products now being used in manasquan the use of which alternatives would be environmentally advantageous to the public of manasquan g it is understood that polystyrene comprises a small volume of the total waste generated within the borough  however the elimination of polystyrene from manasquans solid waste stream will simplify additional

expansion does not increase the number of dwelling units however if a property owner applies for two or more construction permits within a fiveyear period then the cumulative increase in eav compared to the eav of the original structure shall be used to determine the percentage increase in the eav example if in year one the eav is $200000 and the property owner constructs an addition which increases the eav to $300000 then the addition is exempt from the payment of a development fee since the increase in equalized assessed value of $100000 is 50% of the eav of the original structure $300000  $200000   $100000 which is equal to 50% of the eav of the original structure $100000$200000   050 or 50% if in year three the property owner seeks to construct a second addition that increases the eav by an additional $50000 then the property owner would have to pay a development fee because the cumulative increase to the original eav is more than 50% in that case the fee would be based on the total cumulative increase in eav of $150000 original eav $200000 + eav increase of year one addition $100000 + eav increase of year three $50000   new eav $350000 new eav $350000

applicant shall submit information requested by the municipal agency related to the availability of suitable existing towers other structures or alternative technology evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicants proposed antenna may consist of any of the following 1 no existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area which meet the applicants engineering requirements 2 existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet the applicants engineering requirements 3 existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicants proposed antenna and related equipment 4 the applicants proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicants proposed antenna 5 the fees costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable costs not exceeding new tower development are presumed to be reasonable 6 the applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable 7 the applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures such as a cable microcell network using multiple lowpowered transmitters receivers attached to a wire line system is unsuitable costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable i the following minimum setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunications towers for which site plan approval is required 1 towers must be set back a distance equal to at least 100% of the height of the tower from any adjoining lot line but in no event shall the tower be located in the minimum required yard area or buffer area of the zone district  35394 adopting ordinance  35394 ao619 2 guys and accessory buildings and structures must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback and buffer requirements 3 separation from offsite usesdesignated areas a tower separation shall be measured from the base of the tower to the lot line of the offsite uses andor designated areas as specified in paragraph i3b below except as otherwise provided b towers shall maintain a separation distance of 100 feet or 100% of the tower height  whichever is greater from residential dwelling units 4 separation distances between towers shall be applicable for and measured between the proposed tower and preexisting towers or other proposed towers the separation distances shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line between the base of the existing tower and the proposed base pursuant to a site plan of the proposed tower the separation distances listed in linear feet shall be as shown below in the table of required separation distances between towers table of required separation distances between towers lattice guyed

however that the municipal agency may waive such requirements as it deems appropriate k the following requirements shall govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which site plan approval is required  provided however that the municipal agency may waive such requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby 1 tower facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from property used for residences  35394 manasquan code  35394 ao620 2 in locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal the landscaping requirement may be reduced 3 existing mature tree growth and natural landforms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible in some cases such as towers sited on large wooded lots natural growth around the property perimeter may be sufficient buffer l in approving the tower the planning board may impose conditions including the use of an alternative tower structure to the extent the municipal agency concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties or the neighborhood in which it is located m buildings or other equipment storage structures shall comply with the following 1 antennas mounted on buildings or existing elevated structures shall not extend more than 30 feet above the highest point of the buildings roof or above the highest point of the structure the equipment cabinet or structure used in association with antennas shall comply with the following 2 the cabinet
