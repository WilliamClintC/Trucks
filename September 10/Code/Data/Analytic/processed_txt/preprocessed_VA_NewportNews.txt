shall be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building therefore the intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the land building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interest identified in

meaningfully affect one 1 or more of the purposes set forth above f these regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs rather

of newport news are at times subjected to flooding and channel erosion due to urban stormwater runoff tidal action and storms  such flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public  such flooding and channel erosion is also a danger to the natural and water resources of the city  urban stormwater runoff carries pollution which causes the deterioration of the water resources of the city  the control of stormwater pollution discharges to the maximum extent practicable is required by state and federal statutes and regulations  and such increased flooding erosion and pollution discharges can be controlled to some extent by the regulation of stormwater runoff from new development therefore it is determined that it is in the public interest to establish requirements to

health of these areas and improving the health of the chesapeake bay are not mutually exclusive measures consistent with the continued industrial use of newport news industrial waterfront areas are available and are used for the protection of the chesapeake bay the chesapeake bay waters have been degraded significantly by many sources of pollution including nonpoint source pollution from land uses and development existing waters are worthy of protection from degradation to guard against further pollution certain lands that are proximate to shorelines have intrinsic water quality value due to the ecological and biological processes they perform other lands have severe development constraints from flooding erosion and soil limitations with proper management these lands offer significant ecological benefits by providing water quality maintenance and pollution control as well as flood and shoreline erosion control there also exist however certain lands at or near the shoreline that due to their intense development installation of sea walls riprap and impervious surface have little or no remaining intrinsic water quality value although these lands must be monitored to ensure that there is no deterioration of existing water quality protection as a result of the continued intensive use of these properties the regulations and application of this article to these lands must be tempered by a recognition of the existing intense use and landowners rights to continue that use measures consistent with the current uses of these lands must be employed to protect the quality of the

specific delineation of chesapeake bay preservation areas shall be required as provided in section 37150 the city manager or designee shall have the final authority in cases of uncertainty to determine the extent of these areas by application of criteria set forth in this section  interpretation of chesapeake bay preservation areas a delineation by the applicant the sitespecific boundaries of the resource protection area shall be determined by the applicant performance of an environmental site assessment subject to review and approval by the city manager or designee in accordance with section 37152 plan of development the chesapeake bay preservation map shall be used as a guide to the general location of resource protection areas and resource management areas however a reliable on site evaluation shall be conducted to determine whether water bodies on or adjacent to the site have perennial flow and the resource protection area boundaries for the site shall be adjusted as necessary based upon the findings of the on site evaluation the specific boundaries of the industrial waterfront are designated by the city council on the adopted chesapeake bay area map the boundaries of the industrial waterfront ida overlay the boundaries of the underlying resource protection area and resource management area b delineation by the city manager or designee the city manager or designee when requested by an applicant wishing to construct a singlefamily residence or addition or accessory structure may waive the requirement for an applicant performed environmental site assessment and the city shall perform the delineation the applicant is responsible for incorporating this information into an application for a building permit c where conflict arises over delineation where when required pursuant to the terms of this article the applicant has provided a sitespecific delineation of the chesapeake bay preservation areas the city manager or designee will verify the accuracy of the boundary delineation in determining the sitespecific rpa boundary the city manager or designee may render adjustments to the applicants boundary delineation in accordance

denial of plan appeal of conditions or modifications  performance standards a purpose and intent the purpose and intent of these requirements as set forth in section 37147a is to establish criteria to implement the following objectives prevent a net increase in nonpoint source pollution from development  achieve a ten 10 percent reduction in nonpoint source pollution from redevelopment  and achieve a forty 40 percent reduction in nonpoint source pollution from agricultural and silvicultural uses the performance standards recognize that diverse local circumstances require varying methods for protecting water quality the performance standards establish the means to minimize erosion and sedimentation potential reduce land application of nutrients and toxins and maximize rainwater infiltration where land is undeveloped and not actively used natural ground cover especially woody vegetation is most effective in holding soil in place and preventing site erosion indigenous vegetation with its adaptability to local conditions without the use of harmful fertilizers or pesticides filters stormwater runoff minimizing impervious cover enhances rainwater infiltration and effectively reduces stormwater runoff potential industrial waterfront intensely developed areas do not lend themselves to compliance with the performance standards set forth above industrial waterfront idas are characterized by the absence of indigenous vegetation the preponderance of impervious cover and the presence of intense industrial activities the performance standards for industrial waterfront idas have been implemented in recognition that the remaining natural ground cover may not be effective in holding soil in place and preventing site erosion in areas subject to more intense activity and that infiltration of surface waters into the ground in these areas may lead to groundwater contamination b general performance standards for development and redevelopment
