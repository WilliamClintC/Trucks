coastal building zone and coastal barrier islands in the town and shall be referred to as the coastal code  purpose  conflicting regulations a the purpose of the coastal code is to provide minimum standards for the design and construction of buildings and structures to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes and other natural disasters occurring along the coastal areas of the town which front on the atlantic ocean these standards are intended to specifically address design features which affect the structural stability of the beach dunes and topography of adjacent properties the coastal code is site specific to the coastal building zone and coastal barrier islands as defined herein and is not applicable to other locations b in the event of a conflict between this chapter and other chapters of this code the requirements resulting in more restrictive design shall apply no provisions in this chapter shall be construed to permit any construction in any area prohibited by local city county or state regulation  scope a applicability the requirements of this coastal code shall apply to the following types of construction in the coastal building zone and on coastal barrier islands in the town 1 the new construction of or improvement to major structures nonhabitable major structures and minor structures as defined in  15704 2 construction which would change or alter the

authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives a statutory authorization the legislature of the state of florida has in fs ch 163 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the town does ordain as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards  disruption of commerce and governmental services  extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief  and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which resulting damage causes and increase in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands 6 see also chapters 496 and 509 d objectives the objectives of this chapter are to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  61616 definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they

habitats for many species such as fish and wildlife  and because they often provide important flood storage detrital production nutrient cycling navigation and recreation and water quality functions  2 whereas a wide array of biological physical and chemical factors affect the functions of wetlands and surface water systems such as streams rivers and estuaries the state of florida has declared the maintenance of water quality standards in wetlands and other surface water systems to be critical in sustaining their many functions  3 whereas the state of florida has declared the indian river lagoon as a priority water body in need of restoration and special protection and has established a goal to attain and maintain the water and sediment quality needed to support a macrophytebased seagrass system endangered and threatened species fisheries and recreation in the lagoon  4 whereas protection of littoral and wetland vegetation along the indian river lagoon shoreline prevents soil erosion reduces turbidity levels detrimental to water quality and protects life and property from potential flood waters  and 5 whereas protection and maintenance of wetlands in indian river shores supports federal and state goals to achieve no net loss of wetlands as well as to create and restore wetlands to increase the quantity and quality of the wetland resource base 6 therefore the town shall work in concert with state and federal regulatory agencies having jurisdiction to implement protection standards that preserve wetlands and associated adjacent uplands  and when a state agency having jurisdiction deems mitigation appropriate for compensating a project impact the town shall coordinate with the state agency to assure that the overall mitigation complies with the no net loss

proportionate fairshare options to mitigate deficit transportation facilities and public school facilities proportionate fairshare option to mitigate deficit transportation facilities a purpose and intent the purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors to be known as the proportionate fairshare program b findings the town council finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sectors and that the towns proportionate fairshare program 1 provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative and creative efforts of the public and private sectors  2 allows developers to proceed under certain conditions notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency by contributing their proportionate fairshare of the cost of expanding or improving a transportation facility  3 contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion  and 4 maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth and may in certain circumstances allow the town to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements budget c applicability the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to any development project in the town where the projects traffic impact study or the town engineer determines that there is insufficient capacity on one or more segments to satisfy the development projects transportation concurrency requirements the proportionate fairshare program does not apply to developments exempted from concurrency as provided in section b d general requirements 1 an applicant whose project meets the criteria of section 16803 may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements by making a proportionate fairshare contribution pursuant to the following requirements a the proposed development is consistent with the town comprehensive plan and applicable land development b the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the towns capital improvements element cie includes one or more transportation improvements that upon completion will provide sufficient capacity for the deficient segments to accommodate the traffic generated by the proposed development 2 the town may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency for a deficient segment proportionate fairshare program by the developer contributing to an improvement that upon completion will create additional capacity on the deficient segment sufficient to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the applicants proposed development even if the improvement project for the deficient segment is not contained in the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the cie where a the town council holds an advertised public hearing to consider the proportionate fairshare agreement and corresponding future changes to the fiveyear cie and b the town adopts by ordinance an amendment adding the improvement to the fiveyear schedule of capital improvements in the cie 3 any improvement project proposed to meet a developers fairshare obligation must meet design standards of the town for locally maintained roadways and of the florida department of transportation fdot for the state highway system e application process 1 upon identification of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency an applicant may choose to satisfy transportation concurrency proportionate fairshare program pursuant to the requirements of section  2 prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fairshare agreement the applicant shall attend a preapplication meeting with the town manager or designee to discuss eligibility application submittal requirements potential mitigation options and related issues 3 eligible applicants shall submit an application to the town manager or designee that includes an application fee as established by resolution and the following

certify that the application is sufficient and complete should the application require the town to use the professional services of a consultant the applicant shall bear all expenses incurred by the town for use of such consultant services if an application is determined to be insufficient incomplete or inconsistent with the general requirements of the proportionate fairshare program as indicated in section 16802 and section  then the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies if such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification then the application shall be deemed abandoned the town council may in its discretion grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 days to cure such deficiencies provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure 5 when an application is deemed sufficient complete and eligible a proposed proportionate fairshare obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the town or the applicant with direction from the town and delivered to the appropriate parties for review 6 the town manager or designee shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the town council meeting at which the agreement will be considered for final approval no proportionate fairshare agreement will be effective until approved by the town council f determining proportionate fairshare obligation 1 proportionate fairshare mitigation for concurrency impacts may include separately or collectively private funds contributions of land and construction and contribution of facilities 2 a development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fairshare the fair market value of the proportionate fairshare mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ based on the form of mitigation 3 the methodology used to calculate an applicants proportionate fairshare obligation shall be based on the cumulative number of peak hour peak direction trips from the complete buildout of the proposed development or buildout of the stage or phase being approved that are assigned to the proportionate share program segment divided by the change in the peak hour directional maximum service volume msv of the proportionate share program segment resulting from construction of the proportionate share program improvement multiplied by the anticipated construction cost of the proportionate share project in the year that construction will occur this methodology is expressed by the following formula proportionate fairshare   s development trips i   sv increase i   cost i  note in the context of the formula the term cumulative does not include a previously approved stage or phase of a development where s   sum of all deficient links proposed for proportionate fairshare mitigation for a project  development trips i   those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment  i  and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management system  sv increase i  service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment  i   and cost i  adjusted cost of the improvement to segment  i  cost shall consist of all improvements and associated costs including design rightofway acquisition planning engineering inspection and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year that construction will occur 4 for purposes of determining proportionate fairshare obligations the town shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual andor anticipated costs of the improvement in the year that construction will occur the town shall coordinate the review of impacts to state or county maintained roads with the county public works department any county fees associated with review of impacts or needed improvements to state or county maintained roads including engineering design and cost estimates shall be paid by the applicant 5 if the town has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant then the value of the improvement shall be based on an engineers certified cost estimate provided by the applicant and approved by the county public works director or other method approved by the county public works director 6 if the town has accepted rightofway dedication for the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or at the option of the applicant by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the town and at no expense to the town said appraisal shall assume no approved development plan for the site the applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the town at no expense to the town if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant based on a town approved appraisal is less than the town estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant must also pay the difference if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant based on a town approved appraisal is more than the town estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for the development then the town will give the applicant traffic impact fee credit for the difference g impact fee credit for proportionate fairshare mitigation 1 proportionate fairshare mitigation payments for a development project shall be applied as a credit toward the traffic impact fees assessed to that development project 2 impact fee credits for a proportionate fairshare contribution will be determined when the traffic impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development if the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation is less than the developments anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review then the applicant must pay the remaining impact fee amount 3 a proportionate fairshare contribution is intended to mitigate the transportation impacts of a proposed development at a specific location as a result any traffic impact fee credit based upon proportionate fairshare contributions for a proposed development may not be transferred to any other location 4 the amount of traffic impact fee tif credit for a proportionate fairshare contribution may be up to but shall not exceed the projects proportionate fairshare amount and will be determined based on the following formula tif credit   proportionate fairshare impacted

satisfying other concurrency requirements an applicant shall receive concurrency approval for subject trips should the applicant fail to apply for building permits within the timeframe provided for in the town concurrency approval then the projects concurrency vesting shall expire and the applicant shall be required to reapply once a proportionate share payment for a project is made other impact fees for the project are paid and all other aspects of the agreement are fulfilled no refunds shall be given and trips shall be deemed vested all vested trips shall run with the land 2 all developer improvements accepted as proportionate fairshare contributions must be completed within three years of the issuance of the first building permit for the project which is the subject of the proportionate fairshare agreement unless otherwise provided in the agreement and be accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements the security instrument shall conform to specifications set by the town council and approved by the town attorney 3 dedication of necessary rightofway for facility improvements pursuant to the agreement must occur at a date as specified in the agreement 4 any requested change to a development project subsequent to issuance of a development order shall be subject to additional proportionate fairshare contributions to the extent the change would increase project costs or generate additional traffic that would require mitigation 5 applicants may withdraw from a proportionate fairshare agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement the application fee and any associated advertising costs to the town are nonrefundable 6 the town may enter into proportionate fairshare agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility i appropriation of fairshare revenues 1 proportionate fairshare revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the town capital improvements element or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fairshare agreement proportionate fairshare revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the fdot transportation regional incentive program trip 2 in the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the cie then the proportionate fairshare revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of alternative improvements within that
