the board will follow the appeal procedure contained in of including the provision for a public hearing the board may approve an application with such conditions as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this c1a expansions within shoreland district legally existing nonconforming principal and accessory structures that do not meet the water body or wetland setback requirements may only be expanded or altered as follows as long as all other applicable standards contained in this ordinance are met 42c1ai expansion of any portion of a structure part of a structure or entire structure within 25 feet of the normal highwater line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland is prohibited even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the water body or wetland setback requirement 42c1aii expansion of an accessory structure that is located closer to the normal highwater line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland than the principal structure is prohibited even if the expansion will not increase nonconformity with the water body or wetland setback requirement 42c1aiii for structures located less than 75 feet from the normal highwater line of a water body or upland edge of a wetland the maximum combined total floor area for all structures is 1000 square feet and the maximum height of any structure is 20 feet or the height of the existing structure

of nonconforming uses and structures  repairs renovations or modernization which do not involve expansions of the nonconforming use or structure  and such other changes in a nonconforming use or structure as federal state or local building and safety codes may require except within the shoreland zone and areas of special flood hazard as established in any nonconforming structure which is hereafter removed damaged or destroyed may be restored or reconstructed provided that a permit is obtained within one year of the date of the removal damage or destruction and will be located within the original building footprint and will not create or expand any nonconformities reconstruction or replacement of a nonconforming structure not in compliance with these limitations may be permitted provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the board of appeals in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the board of appeals shall consider the criteria cited in e4 relocation amended  42c3a such nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged except in conformity with this the maine state plumbing rules and does not exceed the degree of nonconformity existing prior to the damage or destruction  and 42c3b any nonconforming use shall not be expanded in area except in conformance with this c3c increase in nonconformity of a structure any change in a structure or property which causes further deviation from the dimensional standards creating the nonconformity such as but not limited to reduction in water body tributary stream or wetland setback distance increase in lot coverage or increase in height of a structure property changes or structure expansions which either meet the dimensional standard or which cause no further increase in the linear extent of nonconformance of the existing structure shall not be considered to increase nonconformity for example there is no increase in nonconformity with the setback requirement for water bodies wetlands or tributary streams if the expansion extends no further into the required setback area than does any portion of the existing nonconforming structure hence a structure may be expanded laterally provided that the expansion extends no closer to the water body or wetland than the closest portion of the existing structure from the water body or wetland included in this allowance are expansions which fillin irregularly shaped structures 42d nonconforming use 42d1 resumption prohibited a building or structure in which a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding one year or which is superseded by a conforming use shall not thereafter be used in a nonconforming manner even if the owner has not intended to abandon the use 42d2 a structure nonconforming as to use a building or structure nonconforming as to use shall not be enlarged in any manner or direction unless the nonconforming use is terminated except that a nonconforming single family home in the business and commercial district may be expanded provided that the expansion complies with all other regulations of the zone in which it is located in addition state laws must be adhered to a nonconforming use of part of a building or structure shall not be extended throughout other parts of the building or structure unless those parts of the building or structure were manifestly arranged or designed for such use prior to the adoption of this of any amendment 42d3 change of use an existing nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the proposed use is equally or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use and the impact on the subject and adjacent properties and resources is less adverse than the impact of the former use as determined by the board of appeals the case shall be heard as an administrative appeal the determination of appropriateness shall include consideration of the probable changes in traffic volume and type parking noise and potential for litter wastes or byproducts fumes odors or other nuisances likely to result from such change of use when located within the resource protection or shoreland districts the board of appeals shall require written documentation from the applicant regarding the probable effects on erosion and sedimentation water quality fish and wildlife habitat vegetative cover visual and actual points of public access to waters natural beauty flood plain management and archaeological and historic resources the performance standards in articles 10 and 11 of this apply to such requests to establish new nonconforming uses 42d4 use of land a nonconforming use of land may not be extended into any part of the remainder of a lot of land except as provided in c1 a nonconforming use of land which is incidental to or accessory to a nonconforming use of a building shall be discontinued at the same time the nonconforming use of the building is discontinued in the case of earth removal operations the removal of earth may not be extended as a nonconforming use beyond the required setback lines of the specific parcel upon which such operations were in progress when such use became nonconforming adjacent parcels in the same or different ownership shall not be eligible for exemption under the nonconforming use provisions unless earth removal operations were in progress on these parcels before these provisions were enacted 42e nonconforming structures 42e1 enlargements controlled a nonconforming structure shall not be added to or enlarged except as provided in c1 unless the addition complies with the regulations of the zone in which it is located or a variance is obtained in addition state laws must be adhered to except within the shoreland zone the addition of an open patio with no structures elevated above ground level or the addition of steps shall not constitute the expansion of a nonconforming structure but the addition of a deck or the enclosure of an existing porch does constitute the expansion of a nonconforming structure and therefore the deck or enclosure shall meet all the dimensional requirements of this placing of a foundation below a lawfully existing nonconforming structure shall not constitute the expansion of the structure so long as additional bedrooms are not located in the basement  the structure and new foundation are placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as determined by the board of appeals basing its decision on the criteria specified in paragraph 4 below  the completed foundation does not extend beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure  the foundation does not cause the structure to be elevated by more than three 3 additional feet  and the first floor space of the structure is not increased construction or expansion of a foundation under an existing dwelling which expands habitable space shall be considered an expansion and shall be subject to the state plumbing laws title 30a maine revised statues annotated requiring new soils documentation 42e2 discontinuance discontinuance of the use of a nonconforming structure shall not constitute abandonment of the structure conforming use of the structure may be revived at any time 42e3 lack of required parking or loading space a building or structure which is nonconforming as to the requirements for offstreet parking andor loading space shall not be enlarged added to or altered unless offstreet parking andor loading space is provided to bring parking andor loading space into conformance with the requirements of this both the addition or alteration and for the original building or structure or a variance is obtained 42e4 relocation a nonconforming structure may be relocated within the boundaries of the parcel on which the structure is located provided that the site of relocation conforms to all setback requirements if the site of relocation does not conform to all setback requirements the board of appeals shall determine if the site meets the setback requirements to the greatest practical extent in either case the applicant shall demonstrate that the present subsurface sewage disposal system meets the requirements of state of maine subsurface wastewater disposal rules or that a new system can be installed in compliance with the law and said rules in no case shall a structure be relocated in a manner that causes that structure to be more nonconforming in determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest practical extent the board of appeals shall consider the size of the lot the slope of the land the potential for soil erosion the location of other structures on the property and on adjacent properties the location of the septic system and other onsite soils suitable for septic systems and the type and amount of vegetation to be removed to accomplish this relocation 42e5 reconstruction or replacement within the shoreland zone any nonconforming structure which is located less than the required setback from the normal highwater line of a water body tributary stream or upland edge of a wetland and which is removed damaged or destroyed by more than 50% of the market value of the structure before such damage destruction or removal may be reconstructed or replaced provided that a permit is obtained within one year of the date of said damage destruction or removal and provided that such reconstruction or replacement is in compliance with the water setback requirement to the greatest practical extent as determined by the board of appeals in accordance with the purposes of this no case shall a structure be reconstructed or replaced so as to increase its nonconformity any nonconforming structure which is damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the market value of the structure excluding normal maintenance and repair may be reconstructed in place with a permit from the officer in determining whether the building reconstruction or replacement meets the water setbacks to the greatest practical extent the board of appeals shall consider in addition to the criteria in paragraph 4 above the physical condition and type of foundation present if any 42e6

the board of appeals 42f3 contiguous built 2f3a if two or more contiguous lots or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of adoption or amendment of this if all or part of the lots do not meet the dimensional requirements of this if a principal use exists on each lot the nonconforming lots may be conveyed separately or together providing the state minimum lot size law and subsurface waste water disposal rules are complied with 42f3b if two or more principal uses existed on a single lot of record on the effective date of this if a principal use exists on each lot the nonconforming lots may be conveyed separately or together providing the state minimum lot size law and subsurface waste water disposal rules are complied with 42f4 contiguous vacant or partially built

undeveloped land for sale and the potential for the purchase and conversion of existing residential structures and uses to retail business establishments within the towns village v district  and whereas the existing zoning ordinance and other ordinances and regulations of the town including the towns recently adopted business and commercial zone design standards have not adequately provided for this sudden and unanticipated development pressure in the village v district  and whereas development of retail business establishments pursuant to the existing zoning ordinance and other ordinances and regulations of the town could pose serious harm to the health safety and welfare of the residents of the town by promulgating a pattern of sprawling commercial development that is incompatible with the towns residential areas and historical village centers and has the potential to create unduly adverse visual traffic and other impacts  and whereas sprawling commercial development contributes to an increase in local costs of public servicesincluding to public safety general administration and public worksand thereby presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of overburdening the towns public facilities  and whereas the town will need at least 180 days to develop and implement the necessary amendments to its zoning ordinance and other ordinances and regulations of the town to address this development pressure  and whereas amendments to the towns zoning ordinance require a public hearing by the planning board and the board of selectmen and then must be voted upon at a town meeting  and whereas in the judgment of the town these facts create an emergency within the meaning of 30a mrsa  4356 and require this moratorium immediately necessary to prevent an overburdening of public facilities to prevent serious public harm and to protect the public health safety and welfare now therefore be it ordained by the voters of the town of buxton that a
