secs 1432614350  reserved article ix  sexually oriented businesses footnotes  9  state law reference authority to adopt vtca local government et seq division 1  generally purpose it is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent or effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent or effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material a 2172000 findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings meetings and reports made available to the council and on studies in other communities including but not limited to beaumont texas  jefferson county texas  phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  and cleveland ohio the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses may lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that presently are sometimes uncontrolled by the managers of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for certain activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation oral and anal sex may easily occur at sexually oriented businesses which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such space encourages such activities which may create unhealthy conditions 5 many communicable diseases may be spread by activities which may occur in sexually oriented businesses 6 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 7 the findings noted in subsections 1 6 of this section raise substantial governmental concerns 8 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 9 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the managers of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the managers to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual manager of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 10 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity which may occur in such booths 11 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 12 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses may aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 13 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 14 the fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business or sexually oriented business employee license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 15 the barring of such individuals from the management of or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 16 the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this article 17 sexually oriented businesses can exert dehumanizing influences on churches schools and day care centers and have negative effects on property values can contribute to increased criminal activities in surrounding areas and can exert the same types of negative community influences on other forms of land usage such as parks and nonprofit organizations that provide recreational facilities for public use 18 the offenses listed under specified criminal activity which may serve as grounds for denial revocation or refusal of a license under this article are offenses which relate to or bear on the management or operation of a sexually oriented business or employment in a sexually oriented business the specified criminal activity offenses would also be directly related to the fitness of an individual to receive a license as a sexually oriented business employee accordingly the specified criminal activity offenses are directly related to the duties and the responsibilities which may be authorized by a license issued under this article accordingly there is a serious need to protect members of the public and fellow employees of sexually oriented business enterprises from persons who have committed the specified criminal activity offenses outlined in this article 19 persons who hold or apply for sexually oriented business or business employee licenses under this article should be subject to a verification that they have not been convicted of any of the offenses noted under the definition for specified criminal activity 20 booths associated with casual sexual activity may facilitate the spread of sexually transmitted diseases criminal activities including lewd conduct indecent exposure etc or other activities detrimental to the health safety and welfare of the public and there is a need to provide for the monitoring of activities in facilities which offer either live entertainment or films movies videocassettes video reproductions video laser disks slides or other visual representations which are characterized by the depiction or description of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas and therefore require that areas where such activities occur be fully visible to and monitored by management employees of such sexually oriented businesses to ensure that the provisions of this article are complied with 21 distance requirements as they address the location of sexually oriented businesses or the conduct of licensed employees are reasonable and necessary to provide protection to the community from the adverse effects of sexually oriented business and may be done without depriving such businesses of adequate opportunities to locate within the city or licensed employees from engaging in protected activities 22 the city council finds that the provisions of this article as they relate to signage requirements are proper subjects for council control and that the failure to control signage related to sexually oriented businesses may have a negative community effect that the institution of the signage requirements would serve to reduce the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses upon the community that the signage requirements would not deprive such businesses of adequate opportunity to provide notice to the public of their location and business and that the requirement would further act to protect the health safety and welfare of the public b 2172000 definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this article shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context

2112130  reserved article ii  emergency and nonemergency ambulance services scope this article will govern and apply to the operation of ambulance service ambulances and related medical services personnel within the city  4102008 statutory authority this chapter is enacted by the city council of vidor texas pursuant to vtca texas health and safety which provides that municipalities may establish standards for ambulances and to vtca texas government which provides that combinations of local governmental units may contract for the provision of governmental services  4102008 general purpose and intent it is the purpose of this article a to establish a regulated ambulance service system that can provide stateoftheart clinical quality of care with reasonable reliable response time standards and with the goal of furnishing each ambulance patient with the best possible chance of survival without disability or preventable complication this system will be established for the city or in conjunction with the execution of an interlocal agreement for an area including the geographic area governed by all governmental entities that are parties to any such agreement  b through the adoption of this article it is intended that a privatelyoperated ambulance service providing patient transportation service and emergency medical services be competitively selected and regulated as a provider of emergency and nonemergency ambulance service for the following reasons 1 the provision of consistent high quality emergency and nonemergency ambulance service and any and all aspects attendant to emergency and nonemergency operations provided by qualified personnel with advanced life support equipment is essential to the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city  2 it is unreasonable to have unnecessarily high rates andor public subsidy to make needed improvements to ambulance service in the city when a more efficient system design could achieve the same results  3 the most efficient design to achieve the goals of highquality service at the lowest cost consistent with such quality and performance security in the event of contractor default is the implementation of privatelyoperated permitted emergency medical services to the 911 or other emergency communication dispatch within the city which is essential to maintaining rapid response times and to ensuring

hazard areas of city of vidor are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage  purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area  methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this article uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading
