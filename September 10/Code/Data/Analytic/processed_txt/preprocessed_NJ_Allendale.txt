makes the following specific findings with regard to wireless communications  270482 purpose a the fcc requires holders of wireless communications licenses to build out their systems and provide reliable wireless communication services throughout their service areas these fcc requirements impose a burden on the service providers to install wireless communication facilities in specified locations in order to close significant gaps in service andor provide additional network capacity this fcc mandate to build out the communication system does not preclude municipalities from utilizing local zoning authority to reasonably regulate construction of wireless facilities b the telecommunications act of 1996 preserves local zoning authority to reasonably regulate wireless communication facilities however municipalities may not prohibit or adopt regulations that have the effect of prohibiting wireless service further municipalities may not unreasonably discriminate between and among wireless service providers lastly since the fcc has exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of radio frequency emissions municipalities may not regulate or prohibit the installation of wireless communications facilities due to the perceived health or environmental effects of radio frequency emissions a the purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless communications monopoles and antennas the goals of this article are to 1 protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of monopoles and antennas  2 require the location of towers in nonresidential zones  3 minimize the total number of towers throughout the community  4 require the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse towers  5 encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal  6 encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and  270481 taxation  270482   270483 definitions as used in this article the following terms shall have
