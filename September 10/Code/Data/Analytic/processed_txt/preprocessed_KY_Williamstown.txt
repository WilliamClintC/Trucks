categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with  e and f b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the superintendent shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 cfr 4036e d a ciu may obtain a netgross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section 1 categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the city upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of paragraph 2 of this section are met 2 criteria a either i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters b credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere c credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section d credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the city may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result e when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the city convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the superintendent the city may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in division e1 below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the superintendent whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in division e1c of this section upon notification of a revised production rate the superintendent will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division e1a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the superintendent a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to   the industrial user must also be in compliance with   regarding the prohibition of bypass f the superintendent may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to

the applicable subparts of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 and document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by   see 40 cfr 4036d in addition the superintendent will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from concentration to mass limits or vice versa and make this information publicly available see 40 cfr 4036c7 g once included in its

legislature of the commonwealth of kentucky has in krs  delegated to local government units the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance as follows b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood tosses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increased flood height and velocity and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private loss due to flooding by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood height or velocity  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage and  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other areas d objectives the objectives of this chapter are to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines  streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard or other floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blighted areas caused by flooding  and 7 ensure that potential homebuyers are on notice that property is in a special flood hazard area 8 ensure that

base flood data has been provided without floodways the following provisions apply a no encroachments including fill material or structures shall be located within special flood hazard areas unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development

flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible passed 102810 appeals and variance procedures  15645 appeals and variance procedures a nature of variances 1 the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 2 it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the longterm goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b designation of variance and appeal board city council shall establish an appeal board consisting of the board of adjustment c duties of variance and appeals board 1 the appeal board shall hear and decide requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter 2 any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the local circuit court as provided in kentucky revised statutes d appealsvariance procedures in passing upon such applications the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors all standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility  5 necessity that the facility be located on a waterfront in the case of functionally dependent facility  6 availability of alternative locations which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected height velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action if applicable expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical water systems streets and bridges e conditions for variances upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter 1 generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 3 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the williamstown board of adjustment need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the williamstown board of adjustment believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 4 variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard in the instance of an historical structure a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure 5 variances shall only be issued upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant as defined in this chapter  and c a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased hood height additional threats to public safety cause extraordinary public expense create nuisance as defined in the definition section under public safely and nuisance cause fraud or victimization of the public as defined in the definition section or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation 7 the floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the federal emergency management agency fema and the federal insurance administration fia upon request 8 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance f variance notification any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $ 100 of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the city recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 3 the floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in the communitys biennial report submission to the federal emergency management agency g historic structures variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures see definition upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure h no impact certification within the floodway variances shall not be issued within any mapped or designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result passed 102810  15699 penalty violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with granting of a variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor civil offense any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined no less than $100 and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense nothing herein contained shall prevent the floodplain administrator from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation passed 102810 official zoning ordinance city of williamstown kentucky prepared by northern kentucky area develpoment district from the model furnished by the northern
