noise level nlr   noise level reduction nlr is used to denote the total amount of noise transmission loss in decibels required to reduce an exterior noise level in habitable interior spaces to ldn 45 in most places typical building construction automatically provides an nlr of 20 decibels therefore if a structure is located in an area exposed to aircraft noise of ldn 65 the interior level of noise would be about ldn 45 if the structure is located in an area exposed to aircraft noise of ldn 70 the interior level of noise would be about ldn 50 so an additional nlr of 5 decibels would be required

existing structures have thin singlewall construction with minimal insulation the ldn 60 to 65 area may not be compatible without additional noise level reduction incorporated into the design and construction however it should be noted that in many urban areas the ambient noise level may be above ldn 65 so structures in the ldn 60 to 65 area must be evaluated on a casebycase basis b the land

end of this volume for listing of ordinances amending former art 27900 title this article shall be known cited and referred to as the medical corridor permit zoning district regulations  122297 purpose the purpose of this article is to promote the most compatible rational pattern of land uses in the medical corridor while establishing a core area in billings which has a concentration of facilities offering medicallyrelated services to that end a permit system has been developed to best accomplish this goal for a centralized area which is also designed for compatibility with neighboring existing land uses  122297 criteria generally in the medical corridor no specific land use is automatically allowed on a particular site as is the case under traditional zoning districts instead a set of both absolute and relative criteria has been established which gives greater assurance that a centralized medical area can exist and be compatible with adjacent land uses as well as foster a healthy growth pattern in the medical corridor site and development plans are required to evaluate an applicants success or failure to address these criteria if the criteria are met the land use may proceed a developer must meet all the absolute criteria to qualify for a permit in addition in the relative criteria category the developer must also attain a minimum of at least seventy 70 percent of the maximum points possible in order to proceed if the proposed development is medicallyrelated and seventyfive 75 percent if it is not medicallyrelated to quality for a permit see bmcc section 27912 land use relative criterion for definitions of land use the requirements and procedures of this newly adopted district are contained in this part  122297 official zoning map in order for the changes in zoning within this district to become effective they must be entered on the official zoning map which is located in the office of the yellowstone county board of planning such map shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land inside the city  122297 boundaries the boundaries of the medical corridor permit zoning district are described as follows the area in the city which is inside the boundaries described beginning with the point of intersection of center lines of 7th avenue north and north 27th street  thence in a northwesterly direction along the

zoning system process a the permit zoning system process is a review of development proposals against a set of absolute and relative criteria permit zoning allows those land uses that can meet the criteria pertinent to a specific site b every land use must satisfy the criteria listed in the all development category as well as any other applicable criteria from the special requirements categories the specific criteria which a proposal must satisfy are dependent upon the type of land use being proposed c the absolute criteria must be satisfied before approval can be granted these include assuming compatibility and compliance with adopted official plans minimum engineering and public service requirements and environmental standards as outlined in this document each of the applicable absolute criteria must be answered yes before approval can be granted d relative criteria are the points of the system each development must achieve a specified minimum percentage of these criteria a score above the minimum percentage may be used to receive extra points the absolute criteria are designed to address public service requirements and reduce negative impact of development while the relative criteria focus on the actual design of a project including but not limited to building layout open space landscaping pedestrian circulation and architectural design the design of a site plan is thus evaluated against the relative criteria and scored on a point chart e the performance of a particular development plan shall be evaluated as follows 1 absolute criteria each of the absolute criteria is answered yes no or not applicable a no answer to any applicable absolute criteria will automatically exclude the plan as proposed from further consideration modifications to correct any problems would have to be made before further consideration could be given to the development proposal 2 relative criteria the development plan is evaluated against each applicable relative criteria and assigned a score the numerical score is assigned based on the following 2   for an excellent job of implementing the criteria or for doing the best job possible given the constraints and opportunities of the site 1   for an adequate job of implementing the criterion 0   for no effort or failure to implement the criterion each relative criteria has been preassigned a multiplier which determines the relative importance of that criterion to the other criteria the meaning of each multiplier is as follows 3   very important 2   average importance 1   minor importance the points earned for each criterion are the product of multiplying the score times the multiplier the maximum points possible in each category are added together as are the total points earned by the proposal the points the proposal has earned must equal at least seventy 70 percent of the maximum points possible in order to proceed if the proposed development is medicallyrelated and seventyfive 75 percent if it is not medicallyrelated the objective is to receive the maximum number of points  122297 special requirements the following special requirements shall apply to any area development 1 residential developments the maximum density permitted shall not be allowed as a matter of right and the actual density shall be as determined by the final plan and approved in accordance with the permit zoning process a score of seventyfive 75 percent or more must be achieved among the relative criteria for a proposal which is not medicallyrelated to proceed 2 the city shall have the right to establish general design standards guidelines and policies for the purpose of implementing and interpreting the permit zoning  122297 procedures a conceptual review this is an opportunity for applicants to discuss requirements standards and policies that apply to development proposals major problems can be identified and solved before a formal application is made the applicant must arrange a conceptual review meeting with the zoning coordinator or hisher designee representatives of the building engineering parks and recreation community services citycounty health public works administration public utilities fire traffic and planning departments will be sent notification of the conceptual review meeting along with copies of building andor site plans should it be necessary department representation may be reviewed and changed subject to the city administrators directive representatives from the departments will decide at the conceptual review whether any of the absolute or relative criteria are not applicable for the application in question and whether their department needs to participate at the preliminary and final review stages the general outline of the proposal evidenced schematically by sketch plans shall be submitted by the applicant and reviewed by the zoning coordinator following the review the zoning coordinator shall furnish the applicant with written comments regarding the application including appropriate recommendations to inform and assist the applicant prior to preparing the formal application the applicant shall allow two 2 weeks from the conceptual review meeting for written staff evaluation of the conceptual review and the recommendations of the zoning coordinator b preliminary plans an application for preliminary review may be filed with the zoning coordinator upon completion of the conceptual review meeting and after the recommendation of the zoning coordinator has been made if the zoning coordinator has not made written comments within the required two 2 weeks after the conceptual review then the applicant may submit a preliminary plan at any time thereafter it is at this point that the applicant addresses the pertinent absolute and relative criteria a review meeting is held between the applicant zoning coordinator and other departments and agencies adjacent property owners including the property owners adjacent to in the rear of and to either side and directly across the street from and to either side of the proposal site will be invited to attend and participate in the meeting adjacent property owners will be notified by the zoning coordinator by letter which includes a brief explanation of what the developer proposes to build so those persons have an opportunity to review and comment on the proposal and to attend the preliminary plan review meeting the preliminary plan review meeting will be held within thirty days 30 days of the submittal unless the developer agrees to an extension two 2 weeks from the review meeting date are allowed for the written evaluation of the preliminary plan by the appropriate departmentsagencies having responsibility for review of such proposals as determined by the zoning coordinator if approval is granted following the review then preliminary approval will be valid for one hundred eighty 180 days applications requiring a major subdivision abandonment of rightsofway or other items requiring city council action by ordinance will be subject to city council approval before the final plan approval can be granted if no revisions are required of the preliminary plan then the plan shall be automatically considered as the final plan and the final plan review meeting will be waived c final plans the submittal of the final plan follows within one hundred eighty 180 days of the granting of the preliminary plan and it will be in substantial compliance with the approved preliminary plan the submitted final plan will not 1 change the use or character of the development  or 2 cause changes in the development that will reduce the total points earned by more than five 5 percent or to a point below the minimum point total required for the proposed development a final plan review meeting will be held within thirty 30 days of the final plan submittal between the applicant zoning coordinator as well as other departments and agencies adjacent property owners will again be invited to attend and participate in the meeting as with the preliminary plan review the zoning coordinator shall notify adjacent property owners by letter of the final plan submittal inviting their comments prior to and at the meeting the zoning coordinator will distribute plans to the departments and agencies which participated in the conceptual and preliminary reviews for their evaluation the applicant shall allow thirty 30 days from the date of submittal for receipt of the written staff evaluation of the final plan review applicant and adjacent property owners dissatisfied with the decision of the zoning coordinator shall have the process of appeal to the city council as outlined below in section 27916  122297 content of development submittal a applications for site and building permit review are not required for the conceptual review as this stage of the process is intended to allow the developer to meet informally with the zoning coordinator and other appropriate staff to determine if the proposal is worth pursuing before heshe has incurred any substantial expense the conceptual review stage is also provided so that a developer can obtain initial feedback from the zoning coordinator as to what heshe and other departments may want to include in the preliminary and final plans b for the preliminary and final review

resolve differences adjacent property owners will be invited to attend the preliminary plan review meeting g following the preliminary plan review meeting the zoning coordinator shall again notify adjacent property owners as outlined in this document by letter of the time and place of the final plan review meeting to afford them another opportunity to comment on the proposal should either the developer andor adjacent property owner be dissatisfied with the final decision either party has the right to appeal the decision directly to the city council as outlined in bmcc section 27916 of this document 2 the review may result in disapproval approval or approval with certain conditions of the proposed development approval of the preliminary plan does not constitute final approval but rather indicates an expression of intent the issuance of the building permit itself constitutes final approval 3 activities authorized by granting of the building permit shall be initiated within six 6 months and completed within twelve 12 months after issuance of the permit or within the approved time schedule submitted and approved for larger projects the building official has the ability to grant a six 6 month extension under this system time schedules are included to assure the timely development of the area should the time period expire and an extension is not granted the developer shall

department criterion complied with yes no standards no definite answer exists for the amount of new development which could be sustained in the medical corridor area because it depends upon the type of development proposed assessing the capacity of existing sewer and water lines is very difficult on a small scale basis due to a number of variables large multiple family commercial and institutional complexes or projects would require increased capacity in order to meet the sanitation water and fire protection needs property owners and developers of such complexes will be required to comply with the public utilities department policy regarding fire suppression water facilities stating that it is the public utilities departments policy to require property annexed to the city of billings and property rezoned or redeveloped within the corporate city limits to upgrade water lines and appurtenances and to install the proper number of fire hydrants if necessary in order to provide the required fire suppression water for the citys fire department such facilities shall be constructed by public works contractors either by special improvement district methods or by private contract and the cost of such construction will be directly assessed to the properties benefitted from the construction of said facilities property owners and developers will have to include the cost of upgrading the water and sanitary sewer mains and appurtenances and installing the proper number of fire hydrants within their expected cost of development since the utility systems rely on system components outside the immediate development area for proper functioning upgrading may involve more than just those facilities in the specific development site area any designs for the upgrading of water mains appurtenances and fire hydrants must have plans and specifications stamped by a montana registered professional engineer any such plans and specifications must be approved by the public utilities department and the state department of environmental quality the billings fire department will determine the required fire suppression water flow vehicular traffic what will be the impacts of the traffic generated by the proposed development project and how does the developer propose to mitigate these impacts in assessing these impacts the developer should be as specific as possible in addressing the present and future capacity of the street system so that the city traffic engineer can evaluate the proposed development developer city traffic engineer criterion complied with yes no

the table towards the end of this volume for a listing of ordinances amending former  271101271105 purpose the purpose of this article is to provide landscaping and performance standards which a enhance and promote a unique image for the billings urban area b protect the public health safety and welfare by 1 increasing parking lot traffic safety by guiding the circulation of cars and people and lowering traffic speeds  2 minimizing noise air water and visual pollution  3 screening and buffering incompatible land uses  4 reducing the amount of reflected glare and heat absorbed in and around developments  5 breaking up large expanses of parking lots  6 preserving property values and neighborhood characteristics by lessening the impacts of potentially incompatible uses  and 7

is increased by twentyfive 25 percent  122297 administrative relief administrative relief is provided to add flexibility in the application of the landscaping regulations in this section when a standard is inapplicable or inappropriate to a specific use or design proposal however the granting of administrative relief should not always mean that a requirement is reduced without compensation for example the granting of a reduced bufferyard depth should be compensated by the planting of additional trees shrubs or other plants a written request for administrative relief shall be submitted to the planning director or hisher designee either before or in conjunction with the building permit review process the written request shall include a justification in terms of the findings necessary to grant administrative relief the written request shall close with a section for the planning departments use which will include a block for the decision of approvaldenial the planning director or hisher designees signature and decision date the written request with decision shall be attached to the plan or retained in the applicable file as appropriate an example of this written request shall be available from the planning department the planning director or hisher designee must make all of the following findings in order to grant administrative relief a the strict application of the regulation in question is unreasonable given the development proposal or the measures proposed by the applicant or that the property has extraordinary or exceptional physical conditions that do not generally exist in nearby properties in the same general area and such conditions will not allow a reasonable use of the property in its current zone in absence of relief  b the intent of the landscaping section and the specific regulation in question is preserved  and c the granting of the administrative relief will not result in an adverse impact upon surrounding properties the planning director or hisher designee shall render a decision on the request within five 5 working days of receipt of the request and all required information an appeal of the planning directors decision may be made to the board of adjustment with jurisdiction over the property within ten 10 days after the decision at this time the appeal will be put on the agenda for the next board of adjustment meeting which allows for the required public notice policies 1 the planning department recognizes that the specific landscape requirements in this section cannot and do not anticipate all possible landscape situations in addition the planning department recognizes that there may be landscape proposals which conform to the purpose intent and objectives of the landscape regulations but were not anticipated in the specific regulations therefore the planning department may grant administrative relief in the event of these situations and proposals 2 the planning department recognizes that a proposed development of a relatively small commercial or industrial lot which was created prior to the current landscape requirements may present unusual difficulties in complying with the current requirements the planning department shall attempt to balance the reasonable use of such lot with the provision of required landscaping this balance will be affected by the sites characteristics as well as the proposed development plan the planning department also recognizes that to allow reasonable development there should be an upper limit to the amount of a site that is required to be landscaped as a general guideline for relatively small commercial or industrial lots such as one 1 acre or less the requirements should not exceed twentyfive 25 percent of a site the reasonable development of a site may require the granting of administrative relief to some of the requirements although all of the categories of landscape requirements are considered important the planning department generally assigns the following priorities for compliance with the landscape requirements first adjacent residential uses should be buffered second an attractive appearance of the project should be provided along adjacent streets by landscaped setbacks and trees third the parking areas and building elevations which form major public views of the project should be visually softened and enhanced by trees and other plantings compliance with the requirements such as the third priority above should not be forced into a site design for both visual effect and ease of maintenance relatively few but larger landscaped areas which are integrated with the other elements of the site design are generally encouraged in addition relatively numerous and smaller landscaped areas which are not integrated with the other elements of the site design are generally discouraged  122297 definitions berm an earthen mound designed to provide visual interest screen undesirable views andor decrease noise levels

statement the intent of this zoning district is to provide flexible land use and design regulations creation of individualized planned developments pd it is further the intent to encourage unique development or redevelopment flexible timely and efficient process developments which utilize innovative progressive planning and site design techniques and methods to allow a mixture of land uses densities setbacks and building heights will be encouraged in addition this zone is intended to encourage the preservation and enhancement of the physical characteristics of the site it is further intended that each pd zone will be a separate zone each having differing design criteria to provide for the uses and improvements based on its particular site specific situation  122297 objectives the planned development pd zoning district is intended to include and promote consideration of the following a to permit the development or enlargement of planned industrial commercial residential or mixed use development zones while protecting the character and quality of adjacent uses b to permit clusters of multiple family developments in appropriate locations within single family residential or commercial zones c to permit flexibility in design and use of an individually owned property or a group of separately owned properties to allow for economy convenience and amenity in development d

that permits greater or lesser standards in such areas as density use bulk height parking signage traffic circulation landscaping lot sizes or other elements this may also include permitting the development of amenities such as tennis centers swimming centers and other recreational activities such as an equestrian center within the city limits provided that such an amenity is an integral part of the overall development scheme of the pd however these considerations for allowing greater or lesser standards should be balanced within the pd for example permitting greater density in a pd could be approved in exchange for a greater amount of open space than a similar project not located in a planned development zone would be required to provide  122297   4802 pd application process a pd zone
