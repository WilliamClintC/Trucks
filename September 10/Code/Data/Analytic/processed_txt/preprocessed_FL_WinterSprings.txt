executiveadministrative decisionsgenerally this section is not intended to be applicable when the city commission is exercising legislative and executiveadministrative decision making authority for example and without the intention of being a limitation on such decisions the florida supreme court has held that comprehensive plan amendments are considered a formulation of policy and therefore are considered legislative actions and not quasijudicial in nature the adoption of an ordinance or resolution by the city commission that formulates policy is also considered a legislative action the approval of contracts appointing of board members and the purchasing of good and services are executiveadministrative decisions 3 fundamental requirements quasijudicial proceedings shall comply with

averages for the convenience of the public the fee rates which are based on trip generation have been converted to dollar amounts per unit of development ie per dwelling unit per one thousand 1000 square feet per room etc depending upon the type or classification of land development the road impact fee is determined by the following provisions 1 road impact fee rate schedule set forth in this section 2 the total road impact fee for a specified type of land development activity is calculated by multiplying the impact fee rate for the specified type of land development activity by the number of units of development of the specified type of development activity 3 when a land development activity for which an application for a building permit has been made includes two 2 or more buildings structures or other land uses in any combination including two 2 or more uses within a building or structure the total road impact fee assessment shall be the sum of the products as calculated above

redevelopment or modification of an existing building structure or other land development activity which requires the issuance of a building permit the impact fee shall be based upon the new increase in the impact fee for the new or proposed land development activity as compared to the existing or last previous land use or activity 5 in the case of a demolition of an existing building or structure the impact fee for future redevelopment shall be based upon the net increase in the impact fee for the new or proposed land development activity as compared to the land use or activity existing prior to demolition credit for the prior use shall not be transferable to another location 6 in the case of a relocation of a building or structure an impact fee shall be assessed to the relocated building at its new location future redevelopment of the old location from which the building was removed will receive a credit against the impact fee assessed equal to the impact fee that would have been assessed against the relocated structure credits shall not be transferable to the new location 7 in order to take advantage of subsection 4 5 or 6 above and pay impact fees only for the net increase in development activity the applicant shall provide reasonably sufficient evidence that the previous land use or activity was actually maintained on the site at any time during the fiveyear period

following criteria 1 there exists a valid unexpired governmental act of authorizing the specific development for which a determination is sought  2 expenditures or obligations made or incurred in reliance upon the authorizing act that are reasonably equivalent to the fees required by this division  3 that it would be inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development under the conditions of approval by requiring the developer to comply with the requirements of this division for the purposes of this subsection the following factors shall be considered in determining whether it would be inequitable to deny the petitioner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development  a whether the injury suffered by the petitioner outweighs the public cost of allowing the development to go forward without payment of the fee required by this division  b whether the expenses or obligations were made or incurred subsequent to  after which date the adoption of this division was pending  and c whether the operation of this division would create an onerous burden which would prevent the petitioner from making a reasonable return on his investment b the city shall not permit the extension of a building permit beyond the initial time period for activation without the applicant complying with the provisions of this division c if a previously approved development order or other binding agreement contained conditions regarding traffic impacts road impact fees and their designated uses or offsite transportation

amendments to development orders under the provisions of this subsection must be filed with the city manager within one 1 year of the effective date of this division d if a previously approved development order or other binding agreement provides for the mitigation of the traffic impacts of said development and if the city manager or his designee determines that such traffic impact mitigation measures are substantially consistent with the requirements of this division then the road impact fee payable for such development under this division shall be revised accordingly to reflect the presumed traffic impact of said development there shall be a presumption that the traffic impact mitigation provisions of any development order approved more than five 5 years prior to the adoption of this division are not substantially consistent with the requirements of this division this subsection shall not apply where a development order previously approved provides that at such time as the city adopts transportation impact fee provision thereafter the provisions and terms of the adopted impact fee provision will apply to the development project any petition for such modification of prior approvals and amendments to development orders under the provisions of this subsection must be filed with the city manager within one 1 year of the effective date of this

applicability the proportionate fairshare program shall apply to all developments in the city that have been notified of a lack of capacity to satisfy transportation concurrency on a transportation facility in the citys concurrency management system cms including transportation facilities maintained by fdot or another jurisdiction that are relied upon for concurrency determinations pursuant to the requirements of section 9548 the proportionate fairshare program does not apply to developments of regional impact dris using proportionate fairshare under section 12 florida statutes or to developments that may be exempted from concurrency as provided in the city comprehensive plan or any other applicable law  112706 general requirements a an applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fairshare contribution pursuant to the following requirements 1 the proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations 2 the city fiveyear capital improvement program cip includes transportation improvements that upon completion will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development as determined by the city b the city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency proportionate fairshare program by contributing to an improvement that upon completion will satisfy the requirements of the city transportation cms but is not contained in the cip where one of the following apply 1 the city adopts by resolution or ordinance a commitment to add the improvement to the fiveyear cip no later than the next regularly scheduled update to qualify for consideration under this section the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to section 16b1 florida statutes consistent with the comprehensive plan and in compliance with the provisions of this division financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten 10 years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities 2 if the funds allocated for the fiveyear cip are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the cms the city may still enter into a binding proportionate fairshare agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fairshare is calculated if the proportionate fairshare amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities significantly benefit the impacted transportation system the improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fairshare component must be adopted into the fiveyear cip at the next annual update 3 any improvement project proposed to meet the developers fairshare obligation must meet design standards of the city for locally maintained roadways and those of the fdot

differ regardless of the method of mitigation c the methodology used to calculate an applicants proportionate fairshare obligation shall be as provided for in section 12 florida statutes as follows the cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume msv of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted los multiplied by the construction cost at the time of developer

trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment i and have triggered a deficiency per the cms sv increase   service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment i per section e cost   adjusted cost of the improvement to segment i cost shall include all improvements and associated costs such as design rightofway acquisition planning engineering inspection and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred d for the purposes of determining proportionate fairshare obligations the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the projected future cost of the improvement as obtained from the capital improvements program the mpotip or the fdot work program where such information is not available improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods 1 an analysis by the city of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the city commission in order to accommodate increases in construction material costs project costs shall be adjusted to address inflation  or 2 the most recent issue of fdot transportation costs as adjusted based upon the type of crosssection urban or rural  locally available data from recent projects on acquisition

be determined using this method in coordination with the fdot district e if the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section f if the city has accepted rightofway dedication for all or a portion of the proportionate fairshare payment credit for the dedication of the nonsite related rightofway shall be valued by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city the applicant shall supply a signed and sealed survey and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city if the estimated value of the rightofway dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city estimated total proportionate fairshare obligation for that development then the applicant must also payor provide mitigation of the difference  112706 impact fee credit for proportionate fairshare mitigation a proportionate fairshare contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fairshare mitigation is used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by the citys impact fee regulations as set forth in of of the city impact fee regulations b impact fee credits for the proportionate fairshare contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fairshare agreement as they become due per the citys impact fee regulations if the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation is less than the developments anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city pursuant to the

match for funding under the fdot trip b in the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the cip then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor or sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of section 9563b2 where an impacted regional facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan as provided in section  florida statutes then the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fairshare contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the fdot trip such coordination shall be ratified by the city commission interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking of the developer contributions for this purpose c where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicants proportionate fairshare obligation calculated under section 9566 the city shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using one or more of the following methods 1 an impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the city 2 an account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fairshare payments from future applicants on the facility 3 the city may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution or some combination of means acceptable to the city and the applicant  112706 cross jurisdictional impacts a in the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency the city may enter an agreement with one or more adjacent local governments to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on regional transportation facilities the agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this section to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development b a development application submitted to the city subject to a transportation concurrency determination meeting all of the following criteria shall be subject to this section 1 all or part of the proposed development is located within one 1 mile of the area which is under the jurisdiction for transportation concurrency of an adjacent local government  and 2 using its own concurrency analysis procedures the city concludes that the additional traffic from the proposed development would use five 5 percent or more of the adopted peak hour los maximum service volume of a regional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of the adjacent local government impacted regional facility  and 3 the impacted regional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard adopted by the adjacent local government when the traffic from the proposed development is included c upon identification of an impacted regional facility pursuant to subsection b13 of this section the city shall notify the applicant and the affected adjacent local government in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fairshare contribution based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility 1 the adjacent local government shall have up to ninety 90 days in which to notify the city of a proposed specific proportionate fairshare obligation and the intended use of the funds when received the adjacent local government must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of section 16 florida statutes should the adjacent local government decline proportionate fairshare mitigation under this section then the provisions of this section would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair share requirements of the city 2 if the subject application is subsequently approved by the city the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application evidence that the proportionate fairshare obligation to the adjacent local government has been satisfied the city may require the adjacent local government to declare in a resolution ordinance or equivalent document its intent for the use of the concurrency funds to be paid by the applicant  112706 secs 95569560  reserved article xi  nonconformities intent

communities including the city of casselberry the city commission finds 1 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses further there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this article engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments especially those which provide private or semiprivate areas booths or cubicles for viewing films videos live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers 4 offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities which create unhealthy conditions 5 persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments 6 at least fifty 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections 7 since 1981 and to the present there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states  600 in 198 2200 in 198 4600 in 198 8555 in 1985 and 253448  8 as of  there have been 51838 reported cases of aids in the state of florida 9 from 1981 to june 199 the number of living persons testing positive for the hiv antibody with aids symptoms has risen to 73217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains in a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 15 and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order health safety and welfare of its patrons and workers as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business and adult entertainment establishments where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 24 commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities and counties in central florida where adult entertainment material is possessed displayed exhibited distributed andor sold for commercial purposes in the form of books magazines periodicals or other printer material or photographs films motion pictures prints videotapes slides computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings or recordings or other audio matter or instruments novelties devices or paraphernalia which depict illustrate describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas 25 commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in central florida where adult entertainment and sexually oriented commercial activities in the form of nude seminude or topless dancers entertainers performers or other individuals who for commercial gain perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas  or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers 26 commercial sexually oriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the city or other nearby cities or counties in central florida where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact escort services and other services providing sexual encounters the workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in central florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers including but not limited to acts of prostitution or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness 27 the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and as such are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the good order health safety economy property values morals and general welfare of the people businesses and industries of the city a major industry which is important to the communitys economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit central florida attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes 28 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses other activities which are illegal unsafe or unhealthful tend to accompany them concentrate around them and be aggravated by them such other activities include but are not limited to prostitution pandering solicitation for prostitution lewd and lascivious behavior exposing minors to harmful materials possession distribution and transportation of obscene materials sale or possession of controlled substances and violent crimes against persons and property 29 when the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients blight neighborhoods adversely affect neighboring businesses lower real property values promote the particular crimes described above and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations 30 sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline 31 in order to reverse urban blight the city of winter springs participates in an established community redevelopment area pursuant to florida statutes along the sr 1792 corridor sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments that contribute to urban blight operate at crosspurposes with community redevelopment areas 32 the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity unsafe activity and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life commerce and community environment 33 physical contact or touching within sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases 34 in order to preserve and safeguard the good order health morals safety and general welfare of the people of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners managers operators agents workers entertainers performers and customers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments 35 the potential dangers to the good order morals health safety and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting a sexually oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate 36 requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments 37 prohibiting sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments from operating within set distances of educational institutions religious institutions residences areas zoned or designated for residential use and parks at which minors are customarily found will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments and businesses 38 straddle dancing unregulated private performances and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression 39 workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses including but not limited to a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of of the florida statutes operation without occupational licenses and illegal and unlicensed massage 40 physical contact or touching between workers of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmissible diseases 41 the practice of not paying workers at sexually oriented businesses and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers 42 sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health good order morals welfare and safety of the community 43 requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur 44 this article shall not be construed as opting the city of winter springs out of the seminole county public decency ordinance 45 the general welfare health good order and

provisions of this policy 1 unexplained excessive use shall mean the amount of potable water use metered by the city at an individual customers premise for a single billing period which is not considered as being customary for that account and is not known as to why the consumption occurred based on the usage criteria reflected in this policy 2 individually metered residential service shall refer to those water accounts classified as being residential whose domestic water requirements are individually metered by the city if the applicable customer has a single water meter that registers both domestic and irrigation water consumption the measured water consumption associated with this meter will be considered as domestic water use if the applicable customer has a dual domestic and irrigation service two meters which allows for the separate metering of both types of water use only the meter which measures water consumption primarily for indoor use will be considered as the metered domestic water use for the purposes of this policy 3 applicant shall mean the customer property owner or person that applies for an unexplained excessive use credit with the city pursuant to the terms of this policy 4 rate ordinance shall refer to entitled utilities of the citys ordinances which delineates among other things i the monthly rates for water and wastewater service  ii provisions regarding the billing payment and delinquency of utility bills  iii appeals for the review of monthly utility bills by an account or property owner to the city  and iv other applicable provisions relative to the rendition of service to the citys utility customers which are relied upon in the determination of this policy b unexplained excessive use criteria 1 the criteria used by the city in the determination of unexplained excessive water use in a particular billing period for an individually metered residential account as it relates solely to the application of this policy is as follows a the metered water use of an account for the particular billing period shall be at least four 4 times the average water use of such account for the last twelve 12 consecutive months as metered and billed by the city b the metered water use of an account for the particular billing period shall be at least two 2 times the previous highest monthly water use of such account for the last twelve 12 consecutive months as metered and billed by the city c water service to the account must have occurred for a minimum of twelve 12 consecutive months prior to the month where the unexplained excessive use as occurred with no months having a zero 0 usage period d the occupants of the subject residential account must have lived in the residence continuously for twelve 12 consecutive months consistent with the historical water use period that is being relied upon in the determination of unexplained excessive use e the net amount of metered potable water registered at the domestic meter which is considered as being excessive for the particular billing period must be a minimum of twenty thousand 20000 gallons when compared to the average and maximum month water use for the account 2 in the review of the water use and applicant characteristics as it relates to the review of the excessive use criteria discussed in subsection 19985b1 above all of the criteria must be satisfied in order for the city to consider any utility bill adjustment in accordance with this policy the requirements for providing proof of occupancy during the previous twelve 12 months are the responsibility of the applicant c applicability the unexplained excessive use policy is only applicable to individually metered residential accounts and does not include service to mastermetered residential service commercial or nonresidential service or individually metered irrigation service for single family residences that have a separate meter specific for measuring irrigation or outdoor water use this policy does not apply to any water use measured by this irrigation meter for those accounts that are not subject to the provisions of this unexplained excessive use policy such accounts may still follow the general utility bill appeal process as allowed by the citys rate ordinance d city field service requirements 1 any applicant receiving individually metered residential service who feels that the monthly bill for potable water service is excessive and the reasons for such excessive use is not known or explainable by the applicant may make a written application or make an onsite appearance the application to the finance director or hisher designee requesting for a bill evaluation and potential adjustment in accordance with this policy the application by the applicant must be within ten 10 days after the date of rendering mailing of the bill by the city 2 once an application is made by an applicant for review of the utility bill accordance with this policy and the unexplained excessive use meets the water use criteria as delineated in this policy as determined by the city the city shall perform the following field service activities in order to evaluate the metered water consumption at the applicants premise a the city will reread the water consumption at the meter to verify the accuracy of the initial water reading and for consistency in the amount of water consumption billed to the applicant b the city will remove the current meter from the applicants premise and install a new meter which is considered by the city to be measuring potable water use within the accuracy standards as defined by the meter manufacturer of the particular meter being installed c the city will perform a flow or bench test of the meter that was removed from the applicants premise with the citys testing equipment to verify the flow registration accuracy of such meter d only with the prior receipt of the concurrence from the applicant which filed the application for the excessive use adjustment the city will send a utility field representative to the applicants premise or property to conduct a general visual review of such premises to identify any unique circumstances and to assist the customer with addressing the unexplained excessive use situation this review is not considered by the city as a detailed inspection or water use audit of the property to verify use or specific conditions and is expected to be performed during the removal of the existing meter and the installation of the new meter e the city will notify the applicant by direct mail the results of the citys meter flow test and report whether the meter was registering potable water use within the accuracy limits established by the meter manufacturer within to the extent practical five 5 business days after the removal of the meter from the applicants premise e calculation of excess potable water use potentially eligible for credit 1 if the city determines that the potable water meter that was removed from the applicants premise was measuring the potable water use at such premise inaccurately the city will recalculate the utility bill in accordance with its general policy and notify the applicant of the amount due to the extent that the recalculated bill would still result in an unexplained excessive use position then the provisions of this policy will still be applicable 2 based on the citys review of the prior twelve 12 months domestic metered water consumption history when compared to that period of time not to exceed one 1 billing period for which the unexplained excessive water use was measured by the city the city will determine the unexplained excessive use credit as follows a the city will determine the average monthly water use for the applicant during the previous twelve 12 months that will serve as the maximum water consumption or usage rate threshold for the determination of the unexplained excessive use credit the difference
