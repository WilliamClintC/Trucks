of willmar does ordain as follows is hereby amended by deleting the existing text and adding new text to q so as to read as follows q adult oriented businesses 1 purpose in order to protect the citys community image property values public health safety welfare and business environment the city has found it necessary in light ofthe harmful and unwanted secondary effects that certain businesses generate to restrict where such businesses may locate within the city and to regulate those businesses only those businesses with secondary effects on neighboring properties and on the city are intended to be regulated this section is not intended to restrict art it is the purpose of this regulate adult oriented businesses to promote the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to a prevent additional criminal activity within the city  b prevent deterioration of neighborhoods and its consequent adverse effect on real estate values of properties within the neighborhood  c to locate adult oriented business away from residential areas schools churches parks and playgrounds  d prevent concentration of adult oriented businesses within certain areas of the city 2 findings of the city council the city council of the city of willmar makes the following findings regarding the need to license adult oriented businesses the findings are based upon the experiences of other cities where such businesses have located as studied by city staff a adult oriented businesses can exert a dehumanizing influence on persons attending places of worship children attending state licensed family daycare homes state licensed group family day care homes and state licensed child care centers  students attending school  and people using public parks and libraries 1 b adult oriented businesses can be used as fronts for prostitution and other criminal activity the experience of other cities indicates that the proper management and operation of such businesses can however minimize this risk provided the owners and operators of such facilities are regulated by licensing or other procedures c adult oriented businesses can significantly contribute to the deterioration of residential neighborhoods and can impair the character and quality of the residential housing in the area in which such
