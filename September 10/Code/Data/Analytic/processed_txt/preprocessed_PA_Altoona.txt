available with the minors increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation which is intended by use of the meaningful phrase be or remain which was found constitutional in baker v borough of steelton 17 dauph 17 pa 1912 a decision properly classified in thistlewood v trial magistrate for ocean city 204 a 2d 688 691 md 1964 and also borough of

nighttime activities of a minor particularly a minor well along the road to maturity may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this chapter then recourse may be had to the mayor or the police chief either for a regulation as provided in hereof or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant upon the mayors or the police chiefs finding of necessity for the use of the streets to the extent warranted by a written application as judicially approved in people v walton 161 p 2d 498 502503 cal app 1945 signed by a minor and by a parent of such minor if feasible the mayor or the

mature young adult he or she may be exempt from this chapter provided that he or she does not violate any local or state law i when authorized by a regulation issued by the police chief in other similar cases of reasonable necessity similarly handled but adapted to normal or necessary nighttime activities of more minors that can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis

any city street under circumstances not constituting an exception to or otherwise such a regulation by the chief permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity news media and other agencies such as the schools and shall define the activity the scope of the use of the streets permitted the period of time involved not to extend more than 30 minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity and the reason for finding that such a regulation is reasonably necessary and consistent with the public interest and the purposes of this chapter j when the minor carries a certified card of employment renewable each calendar month when the current facts so warrant dated or reissued not more than 45 days beforehand signed by the chief of police and briefly identifying the minor the addresses of his or her home and place of employment and his or her hours of employment k when the minor is with parental consent in a motor vehicle

determines that such an exception is warranted by the facts such exception shall be by formal rule first reported to council spread upon its minutes and so reported in the press finding the facts as to the extent minimal of juvenile delinquency in such age group permitting such rule currently in the best interest of the minors and of the city finding the facts as to a sufficient degree of maturity of those thus within one year of adulthood and finding that this chapter should be relaxed as an incentive to and recognition of approaching maturity by such formal rule covering a period of time designated therein or until rescission thereof not exceeding one year from the date thereof the mayor may take appropriate action excepting designated minors minors in a defined group or area or all minors as the facts may warrant 17 years of age on that date or attaining 17 years of age during the period that such formal rule is and remains in effect m each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations such as provisions for notification are severable as hereinafter provided additional also severable exceptions broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled respectively in elementary junior high and high schools will be considered by council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student government associations school personnel citizens associations ward precinct and neighborhood spokesmen parents officers and persons in authority concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency  2814 home rule charter  2815 c275 beyond the scope of this chapter the word knowingly includes knowledge which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that parents legal custody it is intended to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents obligated to reasonable community standards of parental responsibility objective test it shall be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities conduct or whereabouts of such minor  2816 police procedures a policeman upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the streets in prima facie violation of any provision of this chapter normally shall take the minor to the police station where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for such minor whereupon they shall be interrogated this procedure is intended to permit ascertainment under constitutional safeguards of the relevant facts and to centralize responsibility in the police sergeant then on duty for accurate effective

evidence such as a birth certificate a policeman on the street shall in the first instance use his or her best judgment in determining the age of the person a police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience and may provide inter alia that the policeman may deliver a minor to a parent of such minor under appropriate circumstances for example a minor of tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained b in any event such policeman shall within 24 hours file a written report with the chief of police or shall participate to the extent of the information for which he and the sergeant involved in such case are responsible c when a parent after being immediately called comes to take charge of the minor and the appropriate information has been recorded the minor shall be released to the custody of such parent if the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the minor then the minor shall be released to the juvenile authorities except to the extent that in accordance with police regulations approved in advance by juvenile authorities the minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative neighbor or other person who shall on behalf of a parent assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival of a parent d in the case of a first violation by a minor the chief of police shall by certified mail send to a parent written notice of such violation along with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in the full enforcement of this chapter including the enforcement of parental responsibility and of all applicable penalties  2815 altoona code  2817 c276  2817 severability severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this chapter if any provision including any exception part phrase or term or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected the mayor is authorized to give advisory opinions in writing or immediately reduced to writing which shall be binding and adhered to by the city of altoona police department until this chapter is amended in such respect interpreting terms phrases parts or any provisions of this chapter normally such advisory opinions shall be in response to good faith signed letters addressed to the

that is absurd incapable of execution or unreasonable it is intended that this chapter be held inapplicable in such cases if any where its application would be unconstitutional a constitutional

a short title this article shall be known and may be cited as altoona stormwater management regulations b statement of findings the city council of the city of altoona finds that 1 stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens public health and safety by causing increased runoff flows and velocities which overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers causing flooding loss of water quality and greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater 2 inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff as well as inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities and best management practices bmps resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of stream beds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation and aggregation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens 3 these impacts happen mainly decrease in natural infiltration of stormwater with groundwater resources impacted of recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which protects and maintains surface water quality 4 a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and other activities causing loss of natural infiltration is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the city of altoona and all the people of the commonwealth including the greater susquehanna riverchesapeake bay watershed their resources and the environment 5 stormwater is an important resource public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater and stormwater management issues 6 federal and state regulations require the city to implement a program of stormwater controls the city is required to obtain a federal permit for stormwater discharges from its storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  6209 home rule charter  6209 c643 7 permittees are required to enact implement and enforce a prohibition of nonstormwater connections and discharges to their separate storm sewer systems ms4s under their npdes permit nonstormwater discharges to separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the city c purpose the purpose of these regulations is to promote the public health safety and welfare within the city and its watershed by minimizing the damages and maximizing the benefits described in  6209 of this article by provisions designed to 1 assure safe management of stormwater runoff resulting from land alteration and disturbance activities in accordance with watershed stormwater management plans adopted pursuant to the pennsylvania stormwater management act265 act 167 of 197 as amended 2 utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems to the extent possible and to preserve the flood carrying capacity of streams 3 encourage natural infiltration of rainfall to preserve groundwater recharge supplies and stream flows and to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources 4 provide for proper and adequate operation and maintenance of all permitted stormwater management facilities and stormwater management bmps within the municipality 5 provide standards to achieve compliance with the requirements of the citys stormwater npdes permit requirements 6 provide review procedures performance standards and design criteria for stormwater planning and management 7 meet legal water quality requirements under federal and state law including the regulations of 25 pa to protect maintain reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all waters of the commonwealth and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection streams 8 prevent stream bank and streambed scour and erosion 9 manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes 10 implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to

environmental damage to the maximum extent possible by carefully fitting the proposal to the existing conditions of the site 1 grading roads building sites and lots should be laid out in a manner that will minimize disturbance of the land newly proposed road layouts should generally minimize cutandfill activity naturally level areas should be given high consideration for building sites clustering of development on less steep areas of the site is strongly encouraged as an alternative to mass grading 2 steep slopes altoona is located at the foot of the allegheny front along the western fringe of the ridgeandvalley region of pennsylvania steep slopes are a predominate part of this topography creating stable slopes is critically important to the safety and welfare of the community development must demonstrate the methods proposed to keep slopes stabilized with vegetation andor other engineered features 3 water resources watercourses are the citys natural drainage system for runoff and floodwaters much of the citys natural stormwater drainage has been incorporated into a combined sewer system providing a challenge to regain the natural system and its natural flow patterns it is therefore critical that the remaining open streams and the land immediately adjacent be preserved to carry out this natural drainage function as well as to provide visual amenity to the citizenry 4 vegetation vegetation is an important element of the cityscape it maintains stable slopes cleans the air mitigates runoff and provides visual character to the city and its neighborhoods efforts shall

contain cavernous pockets subsidence risk assessments may be required to establish that the proposal will be safe 3 floodprone areas new construction in the undeveloped onehundred year floodplain or other areas of known frequent flooding shall be avoided wherever possible where such construction has already occurred or is unavoidable the development shall proceed in full compliance with ch 362 and any other applicable requirements at the state and federal levels 4 hazardous waste and other contaminated sites to protect the public health no subdivision shall be approved in areas which may have been contaminated by prior uses or contain hazardous waste unless it is determined during the review that the site is now safe for development development of such sites shall be limited to uses which do not pose health risks for site occupants 5 noiseprone sites subdivisions proposed in areas of unusual noise shall ensure that the safety and health of the occupants of the site are not harmed by the presence of such noise in the event a noiseprone site is being proposed the developer bears the responsibility to mitigate the noise so that occupants of surrounding properties are not unduly exposed to unnecessary noise 6 air traffic no subdivision proposal shall include features which inhibit the flow of air traffic or present a hazard to air vehicles in most areas compliance with zoning will ensure this c the general layout of subdivisions and land developments should respect the natural resources of the site the character of the surrounding area and be suitable for intended uses the

requirements of shall also apply a types of homebased businesses  purposes  applicability 1 a homebased business is defined as a business that is conducted entirely within a dwelling unit  entirely by the members of the household residing in that unit  and in a manner that is clearly incidental accessory and subordinate to the units primary residential use most modern zoning ordinances regulate homebased businesses because of the deleterious effects that these businesses can have on their neighborhoods a homebased business can congest its neighborhoods parking spaces and streets  generate intrusive amounts of noise vibration glare electrical interference odors and radiotelevision signal disruption  draw large trucks for delivery purposes  erect a disturbing number of signs  utilize unsightly outdoor storage areas  and generally change the character of its neighborhood from residential to commercial many zoning ordinances attempt to minimize such damaging effects by designating all homebased businesses as special exceptions and requiring each to procure the approval of the zoning hearing board which is to reject any such business that will adversely affect its neighborhood 2 however more and more homebased businesses are being created that have little or no deleterious effects on their neighborhoods many professionals now telecommute from home draw no extra parking or traffic activity generate no noise or other interference and have no signs while homebased businesses that could have a significant effect on their neighborhoods clearly should still lie under the zoning hearing boards jurisdiction those that have little or no such effects should be excused from the paperwork time and expense involved in a special exception application 3 this chapter attempts to establish such a system by dividing homebased business into two categories noimpact homebased businesses which will have little or no effect on their neighborhoods and majorimpact homebased businesses which may have some effects on their neighborhoods the zoning officer shall determine which of these categories a particular homebased  80040 altoona code  80041 c1038 business falls into according to the standards of below if a particular homebased business is determined to be a noimpact homebased business according to these standards then it may be established without any further approvals however if it is determined to be a majorimpact homebased business then below requires that it must be approved by the zoning hearing board as a special exception 4 this section applies to all homebased businesses within the city of altoona regardless of the zoning district in which they are located b distinguishing noimpact homebased businesses from majorimpact homebased businesses 1 any person who wishes to establish a homebased business within the city is required to apply for a homebased business license with the zoning officer on a form supplied by the city this application shall not be considered complete unless enough information is included on the form to enable the zoning officer to determine whether the proposed homebased business is a noimpact homebased business or a majorimpact homebased business according to the standards below 2 after a complete notarized application has been filed the zoning officer shall have 45 days to determine the status of the proposed homebased business when the zoning officer fails to make this determination within 45 days then the proposed homebased business shall automatically be classified as a noimpact homebased business 3 the zoning officer shall determine that a proposed homebased business would be a majorimpact homebased business unless it meets the standards below in which case it shall be classified as a noimpact homebased business and may be established without any further approvals a a noimpact homebased business shall be a business or commercial activity administered or conducted as an accessory use which is clearly secondary to the use as a residential dwelling and which involves no customer client or patient traffic whether vehicular or pedestrian pickup delivery or removal functions to or from the premises in excess of those normally associated with residential use b the business activity shall be compatible with the residential use of the property and surrounding residential uses c the

definition of homebased businesses given under above shall not be classified as noimpact homebased businesses c majorimpact homebased businesses if a proposed homebased business is determined to be a majorimpact homebased business by the zoning officer then its proprietor must apply for a special exception use before the zoning hearing board and the conditions set by the zoning district in which the business is to be located note that any offstreet parking space or loading berth requirements for these occupations beyond the requirements of the involved dwelling unit shall be set by the zoning
