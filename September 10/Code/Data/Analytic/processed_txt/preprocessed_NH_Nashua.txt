about what is expected of applicants in order to gain approval to develop land in the city this executive summary describes how the land use structured it describes how to navigate the the major topics covered in each article and how the sections are numbered consistent with the format of other city  the land use available online at the planning departments web site  amended 2262008 by  b navigating the land use land use comprehensive in scope and is not intended to be read from cover to cover it is organized so readers may look up only the parts they need the list of articles and divisions in the table of contents shows the main topics and overall organization of the land use while the section listings at the beginning of each division provide more detail about the subjects addressed later portions of this introduction explain different ways to use the land use answer frequently asked questions there are many other ways to use this land use depending on your objectives c land use 1 the numbering system is consistent with the system used throughout the citys land use of the city is divided into parts which are divided into articles which are divided into sections and subsections as follows 1 i  1901 a 1 a  flag  1909  2 outside the section when a reference is to text outside of the same section the reference number starts with the continues to the appropriate level for the reference the names land use  and chapter are used if the reference is to the entire land use 3 within the section when a reference is to text within the same section the name of the subsection is used and the reference number starts with the appropriate subsection number 4 purpose statements the beginning of most parts articles and sections include an italicized purpose statement the purpose statement summarizes the master plan policies that the section is designed to implement other relevant public policies and factfindings governing the section these purpose statements provide the basis for the development standards but are not standards in other words an application for approval of a development cannot be denied because of a conflict with the purpose statement however an application will be denied where it conflicts with the standards d contents of the land use topics within the chapter are called parts the parts are summarized below 1 includes background material germane to the entire land use describes the purpose and scope of the ordinance and sets the stage for the remainder of the document 2 a is the citys zoning ordinances this article establishes the zoning districts overlay zoning districts and special zoning districts as well as use regulations and bulk and dimensional standards these regulations establish the uses that are permitted in each zone they also state which uses are allowed in limited situations known as conditional uses and which are prohibited development standards for each base district are also included b lists the zoning districts a summary schedule showing the permitted uses and special uses in all districts is presented in  19015 this schedule is referred to as the use matrix a summary schedule showing the minimum lot size density intensity height and open space percentage in all districts is presented in  19016 this schedule is referred to as the dimensional matrix c to avoid repetition of contains regulations for specific uses and development types that apply in all base districts examples include attached dwellings home occupations and cell towers these uses may or may not be permitted as of right or as a conditional use depending on how  1909 nashua code  1909  they are listed in the particular district under the use matrix the standards are designed to address particular issues that are raised by the particular use d standards relating to the citys zoning authority are codified in these include floodplain management impact fees signs and wetlands includes the regulations for legal nonconforming uses and structures e special districts and overlay districts overlay districts consist of regulations that address specific subjects that may apply to a variety of areas in the city such as requirements for historic districts and landmarks special districts are regulations that are tailored to a specific area of the city or to a specific type of development the zoning map identifies overlay districts as well as the base zoning districts and other information 3 describes how to obtain a permit and describes what happens if the land use violated it consolidates permitting procedures ranging from legislative decisions such as rezoning administrative decisions subdivision and site plan approval  variances and ministerial decisions eg building permits it also contains enforcement procedures 4 contains the development standards applicable to subdivision plans and site plans some of these standards may also apply to building permits where indicated by 5 formally establishes the agencies involved in the permitting process planning board zoning board of adjustment historic district commission and conservation commission 6 articles xlii and xliii are technical sections needed to administer and interpret the ordinance includes the definition of terms and phrases used throughout the ordinance is the checklist of information that must be submitted in order to have a complete application e using the land use 1 determining where a specific use may locate a to determine what base district a specific use may be located the user must first determine what land use category it is in use the use matrix  19015 table 151 to look up a specific use these are listed by category for example retail sales or heavy industry rather than types of business if there is a question as to how the use is defined the landbased classifications lbcs published by the american planning association andor the north american industrial classification system naics should be consulted these resources are comprehensive classification systems for land  1909 flag  1909  uses or industries that are cross referenced in the land use reference see  b then look at the use matrix to see the status of the particular land use land use categories may be allowed by right allowed only as a conditional use with additional conditions possible or prohibited you should also check for supplemental use regulations because some uses are subject to special standards c finally although a base district may allow a use a specific site may be subject to additional regulations from an overlay district or special district the regulations of the overlay district or special district supersede the regulations of the base district and may affect the uses allowed and conditions required so those regulations should also be consulted 2 determining which procedures apply each section of procedures describes the procedures for zoning subdivision and site plan approval each section includes a subsection entitled applicability this subsection describes the situations where a particular process is needed if the section applies the reader should then consult the other subsections which describe how an application is initiated how an application is processed the criteria for review and cross references to other parts of the land use addition most sections have a subsection entitled scope of approval which describes the rights granted to an applicant by the issuance of approval of the permit keep in mind that not all permits entitle an applicant to begin construction in fact most simply allow an applicant to proceed to the next step in the approval process 3 determining the standards applicable to a site a if the site only requires zoning approval consult the dimensional matrix  19016 table 163 to determine the density setbacks height and other restrictions b if subdivision or site plan approval is required proceed to parts 3 to determine the standards that apply read the sections entitled applicability carefully because some of these standards apply only to certain types of situations  1909 nashua code  1909  zoning districts and

shall comply with the parking standards established in of this chapter in addition to the applicable requirements of this chapter  19055 sexually oriented businesses a purpose and findings 1 the purpose of this section is to promote the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city of nashua by providing special design guidelinesstandards and development regulations which regulate the time place and manner of the operation of sexually oriented use facilities in order to minimize the negative secondary effects associated with the concentration of such facilities the specific purposes of this section are to a establish a procedure that places strict limits on processing time and eliminates any possibility for the exercise of unfettered discretion in reviewing applications for establishing sexually oriented uses b ensure orderly and thorough city review of applications for sexually oriented uses c establish reasonable and uniform regulations that will reduce possible adverse secondary effects that sexually oriented uses may have upon the residents of the city and preserve the integrity of existing commercial areas of the city and of residential areas which are in close proximity to such commercial areas d to protect the rights conferred by the united states constitution to sexually oriented uses in a manner that ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the city and diminishes those undesirable negative secondary effects that recognized studies have shown to be associated with the development and operation of sexually oriented uses e to allow a process whereby the unusual site development features or operating characteristics of uses which must comply with this section may be conditioned individual review in order to be compatible with the surrounding uses of property 2 experience in this city as well as in cities and counties within and outside of new hampshire including the county of los angeles the city of garden grove and the cities of renton washington  seattle washington  detroit michigan  austin texas  indianapolis indiana  and phoenix arizona  have demonstrated that such uses have objectionable secondary effects upon immediately adjacent  19054 nashua code  19055  residential and commercial areas the city recognizes and relies upon the experience of these other cities and counties in adopting sexually oriented business regulations including the county of los angeles as discussed in smith v county of los angeles 211 cal app 3d 188 1989  city of renton washington as discussed in city of renton v playtime theatres inc 475 us 41 1976  the city of seattle washington as discussed in northend cinema v city of seattle 90 wash 2d 709 585 p2d 1153 1978  and the county of palm beach florida as discussed in movie and video work v board of county commissioners 723 f supp 695 sd fla 1989 in support of this chapter the city also recognizes and relies upon the studies done by a the 1979 sexuallyoriented use study by the phoenix planning department  b tucson arizona 1990 c the 1991 report to the city of garden grove by drs mccleary and meeker on the relationship between crime and sexually oriented business operations  d the city of los angeles in 1977  e the 1984 analysis of adult entertainment businesses in indianapolis by the department of metropolitan development

houston texas 1983  and m seattle washington 1989 3 the board of aldermen believes the following statements are true in part based upon its understanding of the experiences of the various jurisdictions identified and hereby finds and determines that a crime rates tend to be higher in residential areas surrounding sexually oriented businesses than in industrial or commercial areas surrounding sexually oriented businesses  b areas within close walking distance of single and multiplefamily dwellings should be free of sexually oriented businesses   19055 flag  19055  c sexuallyoriented businesses should be located in specific areas of the city which are a specified distance from sensitive uses such as residences parks religious institutions and schools irrespective of whether physical barriers are present this is necessary to  ensure that the impact on such sensitive uses by adverse secondary effects caused by sexually oriented businesses are mitigated to the maximum extent possible   prevent ad hoc decisions with respect to a potential sexually oriented business site which does not meet the criteria set forth herein  and  provide certainty to the residents of the city and sexually oriented business operators with respect to potential sexually oriented use sites d the image of the city as an attractive place to reside will be adversely affected by the presence of sexually oriented businesses in close proximity to residential uses schools religious institutions and parks  e the existence of sexually oriented businesses in close proximity to residential areas has been shown in some cities to reduce the property values in those residential areas  f a reasonable regulation of the location of sexually oriented businesses protects the image of the community and its property values and protects its residents from the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses while providing those who desire to patronize sexually oriented businesses an opportunity to do so in appropriate areas in the city  and g there is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany concentrate around and be aggravated by sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to an increase in the crimes of narcotics distribution and use prostitution pandering and violence against persons and property 4 the studies from other cities establish convincing evidence that sexually oriented businesses which are not regulated as to permissible locations often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas causing among other adverse secondary effects an increase in crime and a decrease in property values regulations for sexually oriented businesses should be developed to prevent deterioration andor degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists rather that waiting for problems to be created  19055 nashua code  19055  5 the board of aldermen recognizes and relies on the findings set forth in the 1986 united states attorney generals report on pornography in support of this chapter including but not limited to its recommendations that local governments ban certain features of video booths that facilitate carnal sexual encounters 6 the board of aldermen finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record a evidence indicates that some dancers models and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in sexually oriented businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of sexually oriented businesses on the site of the sexually oriented business  b evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by sexually oriented businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows  c evidence indicates that performers at sexually oriented businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment  d as a result of the above and the increase in incidents of aids and hepatitis b which are both sexually transmitted diseases the city has a substantial interest in adopting regulations which will reduce to the greatest extent possible the possibility for the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts at sexually oriented businesses 7 the board of aldermen has determined that the establishment of a permitting process for sexually oriented businesses is a legitimate and reasonable means of ensuring that a operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with the reasonable regulations of this chapter the recognized secondary impacts of a proposed sexually oriented business in a specific location are mitigated  and b operators of sexually oriented businesses have specific guidelines with respect to where they can establish or operate a sexually oriented business 8 it is not the intent of the board of aldermen in adopting this chapter to suppress any activities protected by the first amendment but rather to enact a contentneutral ordinance which addresses the secondary effects that sexually oriented businesses  19055 flag  19055  have on the city the board of aldermen desires to protect the rights conferred by the united states constitution to sexually oriented businesses in a manner that ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the city and diminishes those undesirable negative secondary effects the previously mentioned studies have shown to be associated with the development and operation of sexually oriented businesses 9 the board of aldermen and

streets conforms to the recommendations of the nashua master plan b provide for the safety for both vehicular and pedestrian or nonvehicular traffic c provide for livable residential and commercial environments d provide economy of land use construction and maintenance e provide safe and efficient access to property unlike the situation in traditional subdivision regulations one intent of this section is to permit narrower street widths while requiring greater connectivity in order to more efficiently disperse traffic protect pedestrians from high vehicular speeds and to enhance the streetscape this implements the following master plan recommendations 1 ensure that new subdivision roads tie into the existing road network in a way that eases the flow of traffic and encourages the optimal distribution of trips throughout the city 2 separate from local traffic to the maximum extent possible 3 seek to implement techniques such as traffic calming measures as a preferred alternative to more traffic signals and stop signs 4 ensure adequate on and offsite traffic circulation associated with commercial development 5 minimize curb cuts on collector and arterial roads 6 ensure that every neighborhood in the city has access to schools community centers parks and open space areas via sidewalks or other trails 7 encourage pedestrianoriented mixeduse neighborhoods as new subdivisions and developments are proposed 8 ensure proper site planning in order to accommodate uses with a high level of pedestrian activity 9 adopt standard designs for sidewalks to be included in subdivision regulations and in the site plan review process  190206 applicability street design standards apply to applications for subdivision approval or to site plans involving the construction of

violation of these sections each day such violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate offense and shall be punishable under  112 of the city available scientific evidence indicates that cfcs chlorofluorocarbons halons and certain other compounds when discharged into the environment deplete the earths protective ozone layer allowing increased amounts of ultraviolet radiation to penetrate the earths atmosphere thereby posing a longterm danger to human health life and the environment by increasing such harms as skin cancers cataracts suppression of the immune system damage to crops and to aquatic life and related harms b the release of halons in testing fireextinguishing systems is a primary source of the release of halons into the earths atmosphere c chlorofluorocarbons are widely used in refrigeration and airconditioning systems in a form commonly known as freon d there is currently no economically feasible technology available as a substitute for the freon used in refrigeration and airconditioning systems and the halon used in certain fireextinguishing systems e the recapturing and recycling of chlorofluorocarbons from auto airconditioning units alone could eliminate approximately 20% of all chlorofluorocarbons used in the united states f the montreal protocol on the substances that deplete the ozone layer an international pact which was ratified by the united states on  and which becomes effective  calls for reductions in the production importation and exportation of chlorofluorocarbons to 50% of the worldwide 1986 levels by 199 and for a freeze on the production of halon at 1986 levels beginning   and was amended  calling for a complete production phaseout of cfcs and halons by  g in light of the current and future limitations on the production of chlorofluorocarbons both nationally and internationally the development and utilization of environmentally safe alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons at this time will create such alternatives prior to the effective date of any comprehensive international federal or state regulations banning the use of chlorofluorocarbons and halons h the release of cfcs and halons into the atmosphere is a global danger to the environment thus any reduction in the release of such materials  2013 nashua code  2081   2082 definitions as used in this chapter unless the context

outside of the city i recent discoveries have shown that the reduction in cfcs and halon levels set forth in the montreal protocol are insufficient to remedy the global health and safety risk created from the release of cfcs and halons j the city encourages the research and development of environmentally safe alternative technologies and products to replace the use of cfcs and halons k the city supports the adoption of international national and state bans on uses of chlorofluorocarbons  however until such bans have been adopted by the appropriate agencies responsible action on the part of the city is necessary to reduce chlorofluorocarbon and halon use in order to promote the longterm health safety and welfare of the general public and the environment l to protect the environment and
