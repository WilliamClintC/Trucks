article is the controlling authority and contains a listing of all investigated studies and findings of the city council made prior to its adoption as follows 1 the city council has investigated and determined that it would be advantageous and beneficial to the city and its citizens to amend chapter 27 of the 1982 city of rockwall ordinances by deleting sections 271 inserting sections 271 which are incorporated in this article establishing updated requirements for sexually oriented businesses and employees of sexually oriented businesses including licensing requirements  2 there is the potential for the location of sexually oriented businesses in the city and such businesses require special supervision from the public safety agencies to protect and preserve the health safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of the city  3 the city council finds that sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of the casual nature  4 the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the city which demands reasonable regulations of sexually oriented businesses to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens  5 licensing has been authorized and endorsed by the state legislature and is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that the operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation  6 there is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime and the downgrading of property value  7 it is recognized that sexually oriented businesses due to their nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to urban and rural blight and downgrading the quality of life in the adjacent areas  8 the city council desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens  prevent increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods  and deter the spread of urban blight  9 convincing documented evidence and case law acknowledging the physiological and sexual distinction between male and female breasts has been reviewed  10 it is not the intent of the city council to condone or legitimize the promotion of obscene material  11 the city council recognizes that applicable state law prohibits the promotion of obscene materials and the city council expects and encourages state law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against any such illegal activities in the city  12 the city council as elected representatives of the citizens of the city has a duty to investigate the feasibility of adopting reasonable regulations to protect the citizens of the city from activities that have adverse effects which are harmful to the health safety and general welfare of the citizenry  13 the city council has conducted public meetings concerning sexually oriented businesses  14 the city council has received reports and heard testimony from staff and attorneys at such public meetings regarding the secondary effects of such businesses including increased crime prostitution drug use and other illegal activities and depreciation of property values  15 the following studies and reports regarding the adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses have been reviewed by city staff and the findings and conclusions of said studies have been presented to and reviewed by the city council a a report prepared by richard mccleary phd in association with alexi alexander jd larry bush ma and mark vasquez ba entitled survey of texas appraisers secondary

associates eric damien kelly faicp and connie b cooper faicp  16 studies differentiate between the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses that provide onsite entertainment and those that are retail facilities that sell goods intended for offsite consumption  17 based on the secondary effects studies testimony case law and other information before it the city council has made the following legislative findings of fact a that certain conduct occurring on the premises of sexually oriented businesses is detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such conduct must be regulated  b that sexually oriented businesses are associated with and promote prostitution illegal drug use and other criminal activity that constitute an immediate threat to the public peace health morals and safety  c that regulation of sexually oriented businesses is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity including prostitution illegal drug use disruptive behavior and highrisk sexual conduct that may result in health hazards has historically and regularly occurred  d that sexually oriented businesses have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime and downgrading of property values  these deleterious effects create a legitimate concern of the city to protect property values business interests and generally protect the city from urban blight associated with sexually oriented businesses  e that sexually oriented businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when they are located in close proximity to each other thereby contributing to urban blight  f that sexually oriented videos and films shown in sexually oriented video viewing booths are available for viewing purchase or rental in other businesses which are less harmful to the health safety and welfare of the community and therefore sexually oriented video viewing booths should be prohibited in favor of other venues  g that the secondary effects precipitated by establishment of a sexually oriented business can be substantially mitigated by requiring separation of the sexually oriented business from residential uses and places of public assembly and from one another  h that retailonly sexually oriented businesses with no onpremises entertainment have deleterious effects on surrounding commercial residential and public properties by causing increased crime and adversely affecting property values and the marketability of surrounding properties  i that as a consequence of greater visual impacts and impacts on property values distances separating sexually oriented businesses from residential uses places of assembly and educational institutions and other land uses should be greater than the normal distances between commercial establishments in the city  and j that certain sexually oriented businesses involving touching between employees and clients sexual encounter center sexually oriented entertainment studio sexually oriented motels sexually oriented video viewing arcades bath houses body painting studios and massage parlors promote prostitution and other criminal behavior and thus the touching between employees and clients of a sexually oriented business should be prohibited  18 based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council and on

arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio  and beaumont texas  and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the city council makes the further legislative findings a that sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are generally uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further mechanisms are needed to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises  b that certain employees of some sexually oriented businesses defined in this article engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments  c that sexual acts including but not limited to masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows  d that offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions undesirable incidental effects and increases the possibility of the spread of communicable diseases  e that persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses  f that engaging in physical contact at a sexually oriented business is not a form of expression protected by the first amendment  g that at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities that occur in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis  gonorrhea  human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids  genital herpes  hepatitis b nona and nonb  amebiasis  salmonella infections  and shigella infections  h that from 1999 to 200 there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv in the united states25174 in 1999  25522 in 2000  25643 in 2001  and 26464 in 200 compared to 1982 when only 600 cases were reported  i that the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with 33613 cases reported in 1982 and 45200 of 1990  j that the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with more than onehalf million cases being reported in 1990  k that the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn  l that according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts  m that sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities  n that numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films  o that numerous studies and reports have determined that areas around sexually oriented businesses experience increased criminal activity including increased property crimes violent crimes and sex crimes  p that the findings in subsection 18a of this section raise substantial governmental concerns  q that sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns  r that a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to apply to the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is operated in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein  s that removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting and visibility by a manager or third party on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal andor unsanitary sexual activity occurring therein  t that requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments  u that the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid with the prevention of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  v that it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct that this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity  w that the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article  x that the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and sex related crimes  and y that the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of the ordinance from which this article is derived  19 the city council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry preserve the quality of life preserve property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and to deter the spread of urban blight  and 20 it is not the intent of this article or any previously enacted ordinance to suppress or limit any speech activities protected by the first amendment to the united states constitution but to enact a content neutral reasonable time place and manner regulation that effectively addresses the harmful

constitution in statutes of the state including but not limited to vtca local government et seq it is hereby declared by the city council that recreation areas in the form of neighborhood parks are necessary and in the public welfare and that the only adequate procedure to provide for same is by integrating such a requirement into the procedure for planning and developing property or subdivisions in the city whether such development consists of new construction on vacant land or rebuilding structures on existing residential property b neighborhood parks are those parks providing for a variety of outdoor recreational opportunities be a minimum of 11 acres and be within convenient distances for a majority of the residents to be served thereby park districts are established by

land for parks the cash amount shall be equal to the sum of 1 the average price per acre of such land  and 2 the actual cost of adjacent streets and site utilities or an estimate of such actual costs provided by the city engineer and the recreation improvement costs for facilities as set forth in the park master plan for neighborhood parks once the city has been reimbursed entirely for all park land within a park zone this section shall cease to apply and the other sections of this article shall be applicable c to the extent that subsection b of this section is not applicable the dedication requirements shall be met by a cash payment in lieu of land on the basis of a per acre price said per acre price shall be determined annually by the city council and shall be based on current land

recoup the cost of capital facilities or infrastructure necessitated by and attributed to new development these fees are generally implemented to reduce the economic burden of a municipality when addressing the need for adequate capital improvements to accommodate growth b purpose financing capital improvements required by new development in municipalities counties and certain other local

according to the statutory requirements stipulated by the texas local government fees are required to be updated a minimum of every five years texas local government  in approaching an update to existing impact fees it is important for a city to assess its growth and employment potential and establish land use assumptions that will guide development for a tenyear planning period ie 20132023 texas local government 5 these land use assumptions form the basis for the preparation of the impact fee capital improvement plan for water wastewater and roadway facilities in order to determine the need and timing of capital improvements to serve future development a rational estimate of future growth is required the purpose of this report is to formulate growth and employment projections based upon assumptions pertaining to the type location quantity and timing of future development within the city and to establish and document the methodology used for preparing these land use assumptions 1 elements of the land use assumptions report this report contains the following components a methodology this component of the report contains the systematic and theoretical analysis of the methods and principals used to prepare the projections and land use assumptions contain within this report b service areas and data collection zones this component provides an explanation of the data collection zones ie traffic survey zones tsz and the roadway water and wastewater impact fee service areas for capital facilities c base year data this component provides information on population housing and employment in the city as of 2013 for each capital facility service area d tenyear growth assumptions this component provides assumptions with respect to the population housing and employment for the city in ten years ie 2023 this information is broken out by capital facility service area e build out assumptions this component provides projections for population housing and employment under the assumption that the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction etj are completely developed or built out f summary this component provides a synopsis of the land use assumptions contained within this report g appendix this component contains information that was important in deriving the population housing and employment projections for 20132023 c methodology 1 factors based upon the growth assumptions and the capital improvements needed to support growth it is possible to develop an impact fee structure which fairly allocates improvement costs to growth areas in relationship to their impact upon the entire infrastructure system the data in this report has been formulated using reasonable and generally accepted planning principles these land use assumptions and future growth projections take into consideration several factors influencing development patterns these factors include a the character type density and quantity of existing development b the current zoning patterns and anticipated future land uses as established in the comprehensive plan ie the citys future land use plan map c the availability of land to support future expansion of development d the current and historical growth trends of both population and employment within the city e the location and configuration of vacant parcels of land and their ability to support development f the growth of employment utilizing previously established and generally accepted data ie north central texas council of governments nctcog 2010 and 2015 employment projections g local knowledge concerning future development projects or anticipated development within the city 2 land use assumptions report elements the following is the general methodology that was used for the preparation of this report a population housing and employment data was collected from the united states census bureau north central texas council of governments nctcog the city geographical information systems gis department the city building inspection department and other acceptable sources this information was then analyzed and used to provide base information for all service areas from which projections could be extrapolated see subsection d b the base year ie 2013 estimates for housing population and employment were calculated based on the information collected see subsection e c from the base year and the information gathered from various sources a growth rate was established by examining recent building permit information past growth trends and anticipated development over the next ten years this growth rate was then applied to each of the impact fee service areas to project the base year data over the tenyear planning period ie 20132023 see subsection f d after the projections for housing population and employment were prepared for the tenyear planning period city staff made adjustments to account for known or anticipated development activity within the planning periods in making these adjustments city staff took into consideration the recommendations made within the 2012 rockwall comprehensive plan update existing public works data economic information provided by the rockwall economic development corporation redc and demographic information provided by the gis and building inspections departments e finally the citys build out projections for housing population and employment were calculated by establishing the citys carrying capacity in terms of developable acres and projecting population forward using the previously established compound annual growth rate cagr to establish a build out year the housing and employment information were then projected to the build out year see subsection g d data collection zones and service areas 1 data collection zones the data collection zones used for this study were the north central texas council of governments nctogs traffic survey zones tszs a tsz is a small geographic area developed by the nctog to serve as the basis for the regional transcad travel demand model and for the purpose of performing various other regional planning activities tszs were originally formulated on the basis of homogeneity and traffic generation potential using major arterials creeks railroad lines and other physical boundaries for delineation it should be noted that several tszs were adjusted in the calculations because portions include areas outside of the city limits figure 1 traffic survey zones tszs note the tszs below have been clipped to the extraterritorial jurisdiction etj 2 service areas the texas local government tlgc requires that service areas be established within the corporate boundaries of a political subdivision for the purpose of ensuring that the capital improvements service the areas generating need the boundaries for impact fees are defined as follows roadway impact fees refers to a service area that is limited to the corporate boundaries of a political subdivision or city and cannot extend into the extraterritorial jurisdiction etj or for a distance exceeding more than six miles the city is divided into four service areas that are depicted in figure 3 of this section water and wastewater

correlates to the water wastewater and roadway service areas identified in figures 3 and 4 as previously stated the corporate boundaries of the city serve as the limits for the roadway service areas and the water and waste water service areas include the corporate boundaries and the extraterritorial jurisdiction etj b traffic survey zone tsz a traffic survey zone or tsz are geographic areas established by the north central texas council of governments nctcog which are used for data collection purposes additionally all databases and projections utilized the following variables a households 2013 household data includes living units ie singlefamily duplex multifamily group homequarters etc existing at the end of the calendar year 2012  to  this number was derived using 2010 united states census data relating to households residential building permits obtained from the building inspections department and address point data obtained from the geographic information systems department gis b households 2023 this is the projected household data by service area for the year 202 which represents a tenyear growth projection this information was derived by staff using proper projection techniques c population 2013 this is the existing population for the base year ie 2013 this information was calculated utilizing the number of households existing at the end of the calendar year 201 the occupancy rate and average household size as established by the united state census bureau and the population of all group quarters ie # of householdsvacancy rate  household size + group quarters population   population d population 2023 the projected population by service area for the year 202 which represents a tenyear growth projection this information was derived by staff using proper projection techniques e employment 2013 employment data was aggregated to three employment sectors which include basic retail and service as provided by the north central texas council of governments nctcog these service sectors serve as the basis for nonresidential trip generation the following is a summary of these employment sectors followed by corresponding north american industry classification system naics code 1 basic land use activities that produce goods and services such as those that are exported outside the local economy these include manufacturing construction transportation wholesale trade warehousing and other industrial uses naics #210000#422999 2 retail land use activities which provide for the retail sale of goods that primarily serve households and whose location choice is oriented toward the household sector these include uses such as grocery stores restaurants etc naics #440000#454390 3 service land use activities which provide personal and

was aggregated to three employment sectors which include basic retail and service as provided by the north central texas council of governments nctcog these service sectors were then projected by service area to the year 202 which represents a tenyear growth projection this information was derived by staff using proper projection techniques e base year data this section documents the methods used to derive the base year data for the city as of  this benchmark information provides a starting point in which to extrapolate the tenyear growth assumptions that are presented in the following section see subsection f 1 population growth one method of predicting future growth is to examine past growth trends the city and county have experienced robust growth over the past decade see figure 5 past growth trends from the united states census bureau and the north central texas council of governments nctcog were examined in conjunction with building permit data provided from the city

assessment of growth when considering periodic increases and decreases in residential population growths that coincide with changing economic conditions various sources were used in establishing the past growth rates these sources indicate rates of growth change between 325 percent and 475 percent see table 1 based upon this data an analysis of the tenyear forecast and city staffs judgment a four percent cagr was determined to be a sufficient assumption for the tenyear projection period the calculated population numbers for all service areas for the years 2013 and 2023 are depicted in appendix a and b of this section 3 additional growth indicators the annual population growth rate has slowed in the city from 108 percent 20002005 to 46 percent 20052010 and finally decreasing to 20 percent in 2010 see table 1 the increasedecrease of residential building permits coincides with the fluctuations in growth rates see figure 7 recent permit data shows an increase in singlefamily activity in fact in 2013 singlefamily permits issued from  to  were up 70 percent from the same period in 2012 this recent increase in singlefamily building permits combined with the texas water boards tenyear and 20year county population projections coupled with an overall sense of market recovery has led the citys staff to comfortably assume that the overall growth for the next tenyear period will average four percent however it is likely that annual growth will gradually increase from its current two percent rate to a five percent rate near the end of the forecasted period figure 7 historic singlefamily building permits data 2013  4 existing land use in any evaluation and projection of future land use patterns a documentation of existing conditions is necessary an analysis of existing land use patterns was prepared based on a zoning classification inventory of the city see table 2 this also serves to document the present physical condition of the city with regard to any infrastructure deficiencies that may exist the citys comprehensive plan will serve as an additional basis for future growth projections nearly 25 percent of the citys land area is devoted to planned development districts which are difficult to define in terms of land use since most of them contain allowances for a mixture of land uses in addition to current zoning classifications table 2 also contains estimates of the land use categories permitted within the citys planned development districts figure 8 existing land use map zoning map 5 existing employment the base employment data ie 2013 was calculated by traffic survey zone tsz from employment estimates provided by the north central texas council of governments nctcog as tszs do not conform to the corporate boundaries of a city staff made allocations based on the locations of existing land uses and the percentage of the tsz located within the city limitsextraterritorial jurisdiction etj additionally staff reviewed the 2010 and 2015 nctcog employment estimates and applied manual adjustments based on local knowledge of the city and proposedcurrent development from this employment data staff determined the compound annual growth rate cagr and applied it using the linear extrapolation method to the 2010 employment data this resulted in the 2013 employment data depicted in appendix c and d of this report f tenyear growth assumptions 1 generally in this study growth is characterized by two forms 1 population ie residential land use and 2 employment ie nonresidential land use to calculate a reasonable growth rate for population and employment it was necessary for staff to make a series of assumptions on which to base the tenyear growth projections these assumptions are summarized as follows a future growth identified within this study will conform to the future land use plan depicted in the comprehensive plan b the city will be able to finance the necessary improvements to accommodate future growth c school facilities will sufficiently accommodate any identified increases in the population d densities will conform to the land classifications identified within the comprehensive plan and as depicted on the future land use plan the tenyear projections are based on the growth rate which was previously discussed and staffs consideration of past development trends tables 3 and 4 detail the tenyear projections for households population and employment for the service areas associated with roadway and waterwastewater impact fees 2 population 2023 the city has experienced significant growth since 2000 when the estimated population was 18000 residents today the population is over double the 2000 population at an estimated 39817 this growth trend is not just evident in the city as the greater dallasfort worth metropolitan area has become one of the fastest growing regions in the united states both in terms of population and employment although local growth has slowed since 2006 all data appears to indicate that this is only a temporary condition as the areas economy continues to recover from the national housing slump that began in 2008 using the compound annual growth rate cagr method staff projects that the population for the city will be 58939 residents by 2023 see figure 9 figure 9 tenyear population growth at a four percent compound annual growth rate in determining this population projection staff utilized residential building permit counts coupled with an assumption that the average people per household was 281 2010 us census this figure was used to account for a mixture of multifamily and singlefamily households additionally between 2000 and 2012 the city issued an average of 623 building permits per year  with the highest number of permits topping out at 1033 in 200 and the lowest number of building permits issued in 2008 at 150 see table 5 from this information staff estimated that the city will issue an average of 651 residential building permits per year over the next tenyear period see table 5 and figure 10 this estimate takes into consideration the type of development likely ie singlefamily or multifamily to occur in a given area figure 10 projected household and building permit estimations map key orange   new building permits  green   new residents 3 employment 2023 employment data for the year 2023 was based upon data provided by the north central texas council of governments nctcog nctcog has provided employment data by traffic survey zone tsz for 2015 and 2035 after staffs adjustments for tsz coverage area and anticipated future development were accounted for a compound annual growth rate cagr was derived between the 2015 and 2035 staffadjusted nctcog employment numbers linear extrapolation of the cagr produced the 2023 employment estimates by tsz as listed in the appendices of this document see appendix c and d staffs assumptions of future growth are confirmed by 2030 data derived from the north texas 2050 study published by vision north texas the majority of the city is forecasted to have an employment density of greater than 17 units per acre and upwards of 35+ units per acre in areas adjacent interstate highway 30 ih30 and within rockwalls industrial park located adjacent to state highway 276 sh276 g build out projections a build out projection for a city also referred to as the citys carrying capacity is an estimate of the location and density of all potential development employment and population that a city can support within its future corporate boundaries 1 establishing the citys population at build out in establishing the citys population at build out staff made the following assumptions a all vacant land within the citys corporate boundaries will develop with the maximum density permitted for the current zoning per the unified development all agricultural ag district property is assumed to be vacant and will develop at 20 units per acre c all property within the extraterritorial jurisdiction etj is assumed to be vacant and will be developed in conformance with the future land use map at the maximum density permitted by the comprehensive plan d the citys etj is fixed and will not increase in the future taking these assumptions into consideration staff utilized geographical information systems gis software to calculate all the undeveloped land within the citys corporate boundaries including the etj see table 6 once calculated the acreages were broken down by land use and multiplied by the maximum density permitted for each of the land uses as established within the unified development the comprehensive plan these totals were then multiplied by the average people per household ie 281 2010 us census to establish the population at build out ie 139919 from this point staff projected the population forward using the previously established four percent compound annual growth rate cagr see subsection f until the build out population was

report in preparation for updating the roadway water and wastewater impact fees for 2013 1 the average annual growth rate as calculated by staff is four percent this growth rate was established based on data from the us census texas water commission north texas council of governments nctcog the city and county using this growth rate staff projected the following population numbers a the population of the city as of 2013 is 39817 this is expected to increase by ~32 percent in the next ten years to an estimated 58940 by 2023 b the population for the city and its extraterritorial jurisdiction etj as of 2013 is 44066 this is expected to increase by ~32 percent in the next ten years to an estimated 65073 by 2023 2 the estimated employment for the city as of 2013 is 16023 jobs with another 1991 jobs existing within its etj staff estimates this number to climb to 23182 jobs within the city limits and another 2377 jobs within the etj by 2023 3 staff has established that there are currently 861053 undeveloped acres of land within the city limits this represents ~45 percent of the current land in the city see table 8 additionally the city has access to another 1052160 acres of land within its current etj see table 9 at the bottom of this page is a summary of all vacant land by current land use existing within the citys corporate boundaries and its etj see tables 8 and 9 4 according to

expenditures for repairs and modernization the intent of this district is to allow for low intensity office development providing professional medical and other office services and limited retail businesses to residents in adjacent neighborhoods the residentialoffice ro district shall have principle access to major or secondary thoroughfares and may serve as an area of transition between residential and highintensity nonresidential uses or busy arterial thoroughfares b permitted uses all land uses permitted within the residentialoffice ro district are outlined in land use schedule of permissible uses c area requirements all development within a residentialoffice ro district shall conform to general commercial district standards and the related standards listed within nonresidential district development standards  11192018   neighborhood services ns district a purpose the neighborhood services ns district is a zoning district intended to provide limited retail land uses near neighborhoods for the purpose of supplying the daytoday retail and personal service needs of residents the neighborhood services ns district is typically located at limited corner locations on arterials in existing developments and is intended to serve small service areas the average site is from 12acre to a maximum of two 2 acres since these sites are typically small and surrounded by residential development they can appear to be spot zones  however the comprehensive plan acknowledges the need to create neighborhood units which involve the need for limited retail and service uses in close proximity to neighborhoods these convenience centers should be constructed to a residential scale and be visually and dimensionally compatible to adjacent residential developments the neighborhood services ns district should not contain uses that create excessive amounts of traffic noise litter or that would not be conducive to residential adjacency due to the residential adjacency of this zoning district increased landscaping and buffering requirements are necessary b permitted uses all land uses permitted within the neighborhood services ns district are outlined in land use schedule of permissible uses c area requirements all development within a neighborhood services ns district shall conform to general commercial district standards and the related standards listed within nonresidential district development standards  11192018   general retail gr district a purpose the general retail gr district is a zoning district intended to provide limited retail and service uses for one 1 or more neighborhoods the land uses specified in this district include most types of retail and office activity and are typically located onat the intersections of major thoroughfares this district does not include strip commercialretail centers large shopping centers wholesaling operations lumberyards contractor yards andor warehouses with high volumes of commercial truck traffic the general retail gr district is not a major commercialretail district and should try to avoid intensive commercial land uses that carry large volumes of retail traffic the noise traffic litter late night hours and other influences that could be harmful to residential areas require adequate buffering and screening from residential areas traffic from land uses in this district should not pass areas except on arterial or major collectors there are restrictions on access to prevent traffic congestion or an adverse effect on major thoroughfares adjacent to residential areas areas should not be zoned general retail gr district unless they are located on or close to an arterial or major collector that is capable of carrying increased traffic since the general retail gr district will be located close to residential areas the development standards are stringent and require high standards of development similar to the residentialoffice ro and neighborhood services ns districts b permitted uses all land uses permitted within the general retail gr district are outlined in land use schedule of permissible uses c area requirements all development within a general retail gr district shall conform to general commercial district standards and the related standards listed within nonresidential district development standards  11192018   commercial c district a purpose the commercial c district is the proper zoning classification for most types of commercial development eg larger shopping centers at major intersections commercial strips along arterial roadways etc the land uses specified for the commercial c district include most types of office and retail activity with some special provisions for wholesale land uses this district mostly excludes land uses that are not compatible with retail shopping eg lumberyards contractor yards warehousing or other land uses with high volumes of truck traffic and low volumes of retail traffic the noise traffic litter late night hours and other influences that could be harmful to neighborhoods require adequate buffering and mitigating factors when locating adjacent to residential areas areas should not be zoned to commercial c district unless they are located on or close to an arterial or major collector that is capable of carrying the additional traffic generated by land uses in this district in addition these areas may require increased water fire protection wastewater and drainage capacity the commercial c district is a general business zone and is intended to service most commercial land uses with the exception of land uses that would fall into the heavy commercial hc district since the commercial c district is general in nature the development standards are less stringent and do not require as high of standards of development as the residentialoffice ro neighborhood services ns and general retail gr districts b permitted uses all land uses permitted within the commercial c district are outlined in land use schedule of permissible uses c area requirements all development within a commercial c district shall conform to general commercial district standards and the related standards listed within nonresidential district development standards d special district requirements 1 business operations and storage all business operations including storage shall be conducted within a completely enclosed building unless specifically authorized for the use as stipulated in land use schedule of permissible uses this excludes offstreet parking and loading incidental display of retail items for sale retail outlets where gasoline products are sold and drivein businesses  11192018   heavy commercial hc district a purpose the heavy commercial hc district is the proper zoning classification for commercial establishments that may involve uses that would not be suitable in the other commercial zoning districts included in this district are commercial uses that involve large volumes of commercial truck traffic outside operations outside storage of materials and equipment excessive noise from heavy service operations andor any other possibly adverse operations the heavy commercial hc district is commercial in nature but has some aspects that are similar to industrial land uses the zoning district allows noise traffic litter late night hours outside storage of materials and equipment and other influences that could be harmful if directly adjacent to residential areas and will require adequate buffering and other mitigating factors if such an adjacency exists areas should not be zoned to heavy commercial hc district unless they are located on or close to an arterial that is capable of carrying large volumes of commercial truck traffic businesses locating in the heavy commercial hc district should work with the city to ensure that water wastewater and drainage capacity is adequate before locating on a particular property and that streets in and adjacent to this district are of a size and strength to accommodate commercial truck traffic b permitted uses all land uses permitted within the heavy commercial hc district are outlined in land use schedule of permissible uses c area requirements all development within a commercial c district shall conform to general commercial district standards and the related standards listed within nonresidential district development standards d special district requirements 1 outside storage a all outside storage shall be placed behind the front facade of the main structure this does not apply to uses that allow incidental display in which case only the amount of goods necessary for display purposes shall be exempt from this requirement b all outside storage shall be screened from streets and public areas  11192018   downtown dt district i purpose goals and intent a purpose the purpose of the downtown district is to implement the adopted recommendations of the comprehensive plan and

exception being requested ie detail the unique or extraordinary conditions that exist andor the undue hardship created by strict adherence to the technical requirements d open space guidelines industrial land uses should be designed to be integrated with adjacent land uses as opposed to separating land uses using physical barriers or screening walls  unless necessary  this should be achieved by making industrial developments pedestrianoriented and easily accessible to adjacent developments use of natural buffers open space and trails this involves creating trails that connect commercial and residential developments using landscape buffers that incorporate berms and landscaping to separate residential and nonresidential land uses and utilizing building design to create compatibility with surrounding land uses  11192018 subsection 502  light industrial li district a purpose the light industrial li district is a zoning district intended to create a limited industrial zone that provides for modern types of industrial land uses with the exception of hazardous materialsmanufacturing this zone allows the same uses as the heavy industrial hi district limitations have been placed on the uses in this district to significantly restrict outside activities and the storage of materials noise vibration smoke pollution fire and explosive hazards glare and any other potentially adverse externalities the light industrial li district is intended for industrial parks and larger cleaner types of industries the manufacturing uses should be conducted within a totally enclosed building and any activities conducted outside should be screened and buffered to ensure no external effects eg excessive noise or odor extend beyond the property lines the locations for these types of industrial land uses are typically a minimum of two 2 acres and average of five 5 to ten 10 acres these types of development also incorporate open space and significant amounts of land dedicated to landscaping since this zoning district accommodates limited industrial activities that require substantial screening and buffering requirements the light industrial li district is a suitable zoning designation for high visibility locations eg ih30 and sh276 or within a reasonable distance of residential areas as long as they are separated by an appropriate amount of open space residential uses should be discouraged from locating directly adjacent to or near the light industrial li district to protect these types of businesses from excessive complaints about performance standards areas should not be zoned to light industrial li district unless they are located on or close to an arterial capable of carrying commercial truck traffic in industrial parks internal streets should be of a size and strength to accommodate commercial truck traffic businesses locating in the light industrial li district should work with the city to ensure that water wastewater and drainage capacity is adequate before locating on a particular property b permitted uses all land uses permitted within the light industrial li district are outlined in land use schedule of permissible uses c area requirements all development within a light industrial li district shall conform to general industrial district standards and the related standards listed within nonresidential district development standards d special district requirements 1 manufacturing operations and storage all business and manufacturing operations including storage shall be conducted within a completely enclosed building unless specifically authorized for the use as listed in land use schedule of permissible uses  11192018   heavy industrial hi district a purpose the city of rockwall recognizes that some industrial uses cannot be conducted within a totally enclosed building are not visually attractive may involve hazardous materials and could have adverse impacts to adjacent land uses due to noise odor pollution and truck traffic the heavy industrial hi district is intended to provide adequate space and site diversification for these types of developments the development standards in the heavy industrial hi district are minimal and allow both large and small industrial uses either on separate small lots or as part of a larger industrial park some screening is required but because of the potential for hazardous or possibly adverse uses this district should not be located close to residential areas of any type areas should not be zoned heavy industrial hi district unless they are located on or close to an arterial roadway capable of carrying commercial truck traffic internal streets in the heavy industrial hi district should be of a size and strength to accommodate commercial truck traffic businesses locating in the heavy industrial hi district should work with the city to ensure that water wastewater and drainage capacity is adequate before locating on a particular

following architectural styles bungalow the bungalow style is a unique house type that borrows from other cultures but is a truly american design developed on the west coast the bungalow reduces the distinction between inside and outside space reflecting open practical living it is generally a low small house that used natural materials and relief on simplified design the roof structure is most often broad gables often with a separate lower gable covering the porch although hipped roof structures are also common there is little ornamentation and what is found is of simplified design the first bungalow development period was from 1895 to 1915 cottage a cottage is basically a small frame singlefamily home that does not use any particular architectural style or ornamentation pattern roof styles vary but most often use gable hip or a combination of the two this is a style that often borrows elements from classic styles but does not incorporate other elements that make the style unique craftsman an extension of the early bungalow the craftsman design included a lowpitched gabled roof with a wide unenclosed eave overhang roof rafters are usually exposed and decorative beams or braces are commonly added under gables porches are either full or partialwidth with a roof often supported by tapered square columns the most distinctive features of this are the junctions where the roof joins the wall where the most ornamentation occurs this was the dominant style for smaller homes from 1905 to early 1920s the popularity of the style faded quickly however and few were built

the purpose of this section is to promote the establishment of water conscious landscaping implementation of xeriscaping principles additionally this section is intended to provide an alternative to the typical landscape requirements for commercial properties b principles all xeriscaping plans submitted to the city should demonstrate conformance with the following principles 1 planning and design landscape designs and plans should take into account the regional and microclimatic conditions of the site its existing vegetation and topographical conditions the intended use and the zoning ie vegetation zone of plant materials according to their unique water needs plans should take into account the various heights of landscaping materials if the landscape plan is proposed in phases to account for optimum planting times all future phases should be included on the submitted landscape plan in reviewing plans to ensure proper site planning and design staff shall ensure that the plan 1 preserves and protects existing vegetation 2 preserves and protects topsoil 3 stabilizes and covers all bare soil areas and 4 incorporates energywater conservation 2 soil improvement since soil tends to vary from site to site all soil should be analyzed to determine what plants are suitable to include on the landscape plan and if any soil amendments are required soil may require additional organic material be added to ensure the continued health of plants 3 appropriate plant selection plant selection should be based on the plants adaptability to the existing site conditions and need for supplemental watering most xeriscape plants will not require supplemental watering in selecting plant materials mature plants and shrubs should be used to ensure establishment after installation a list of plants that are native and acceptable within the city has been provided in appendix f recommended plantings of the unified development   however staff may approve alternate plantings if they are deemed appropriate for the site in reviewing plans for conformance to this principle staff will consider the 1 diversity of the plant species being proposed 2 size maturity and water requirements of the selected plantings and 3 variation of height spread and color 4 practical turf areas the type and location of turf areas are considered to be a major design element in xeriscape plans turf in this case involves typical varieties of bermuda st augustine ryegrass blends etc the maintenance needs of turf can be minimized by the shape area irrigation equipment and turf type selected drainage areas and sloped areas are especially suited to the use of native grasses as opposed to turf in reviewing plans to ensure that the turf areas being proposed are practical staff will review 1 the design of the turf areas with rounded compact turf areas being more efficient 2 turf areas should be designed to be on a separate zone from other landscaping 3 turf should be appropriate for the selected location 4 turf should be avoided on slopes and drainage areas in favor of native grasses and 5 minimize turf areas by using native grasses hardscape elements and alternatives 5 efficient irrigation all landscaping is required to have an irrigation system that is designed by a licensed irrigator additionally all irrigation systems should be designed to be water efficient utilizing lowflow irrigation equipment the plan should show that turf areas should be watered separately and plants should be grouped in separate zones based on water need finally all irrigation systems are required to be maintained in proper working order 6 use of mulches mulches minimize evaporation reduce weed growth slow erosion and help maintain soil temperature in reviewing the use of mulches in xeriscape plans staff shall ensure 1 the use of a deep layer of mulch in planting beds typically three to four inches is utilized and 2 mulches should be locally or regionally derived materials additionally mulches may include the use of pea gravel crushed granite rock or pebbles in unplanted areas 7 appropriate maintenance proper pruning weeding and fertilization as required with all landscape plans shall be required typically xeriscape plans require less maintenance fertilizer and other chemicals and pesticides c standards 1 if approved with a landscape plan native grasses shall be exempt from the rules and requirements of section 1643 weeds brush and grass  however the grass should be maintained to a height typical for the particular native grass 2 drainage or detention areas that utilize native grasses in lieu of turf shall be exempt from the requirements stipulated by section 512c ie one tree per every 750 square feet of dry land area instead a shrub or ornamental grass per every 1500 square feet of dry land area shall be required to be planted on the site or around the detention area 3 a maximum of 30 percent mulches or hardscape is permitted to be incorporated into all xeriscape plans this may be increased by the planning and zoning commission if deemed appropriate and necessary for the proposed plan d approval of xeriscape plans all xeriscape plans shall require approval by the planning and zoning commission upon a recommendation by staff concerning conformance to the requirements of this section at the time of site plan approval  1272015

districts pd districts pd districts are intended to provide for the development of land as an integral unit for single or mixed use in accordance with a pd concept plan that may include uses regulations and other requirements that vary from this unified development from other ordinances rules or regulations of the city pd districts are intended to implement the goals and objectives of the citys comprehensive plan but may be accompanied by specific amendments to provisions of the comprehensive plan the parks and open space plan or the thoroughfare plan pd districts are also intended to encourage flexible and creative planning to ensure the compatibility of land uses and to allow for the adjustment of changing demands to meet the current needs of the community by meeting one or more of the following purposes  to provide for a superior design of lots or buildings   to provide for increased recreation andor open space opportunities for public use   to provide amenities or features that would be of special benefit to the property users or community   to protect or preserve natural amenities and environmental assets such as trees creeks ponds floodplains slopes or hills and view corridors   to protect or preserve existing historical buildings structures features or places  or  to provide an appropriate balance between the intensity of development and the ability to provide adequate supporting public facilities and services  762010 nature of pd districts and minimum standards each pd district is intended to be a freestanding zoning district in which land uses and intensities of land use may be tailored to fit the physical features of the site and to achieve compatibility with existing and planned adjacent uses in order to ensure that a pd district implements the policies of the comprehensive plan and to further ensure that the pd district is in accordance with a comprehensive plan of zoning regulation it is necessary to establish minimum standards for residential and nonresidential uses proposed for the pd district that must be incorporated within an ordinance adopted by the council the pd ordinance a land use 1 uses unless otherwise provided by

earthen berms with landscaping during the review of the pd development plan  pd plans required there are three types of plans that may be required as part of the development process within a pd district each successive plan may modify the previous plan provided that it does not substantially change the general intent of the original pd district each successive plan becomes part of the zoning ordinance governing the property and replaces the previously approved plan a pd concept plan the pd concept plan is mandatory and is intended to be used as the first step in the pd development process it establishes the most general guidelines for the pd district by identifying the land uses and intensities thoroughfare locations and open space boundaries including public trail systems it may include images of intended style and type of development the concept plan illustrates the integration of these elements into a master plan for the whole pd district the pd concept plan establishes the development standards for the pd district b pd development plan a pd development plan is optional and is intended to be used where appropriate as the second step of the pd development process it may be required by the pd ordinance or it may be submitted voluntarily by the property owner a pd development plan constitutes an amendment to the approved pd concept plan and pd ordinance and may be used where the developer requests or the council requires certain standards for the pd district to be specified after initial establishment of the pd district a pd development plan includes more detailed information as to the specific development standards and land uses including their boundaries the purposes of a pd development plan are to allow flexibility in the development process by deferring specification of all development standards at the time of pd district creation and to enable developers to satisfy conditions imposed on creation of the district prior to submittal of a pd site plan c pd site plan a pd site plan is mandatory and is the final step of the pd development process the purposes of a pd site plan are to ensure that the development of individual building lots parcels or tracts within the pd district are consistent with the approved concept plan and development plan if any and to ensure that the standards applicable within the pd district are met for each such lot parcel or tract a pd site plan shall continue to be valid for a period of two years after it is approved by the commission  however such period may be extended by the council upon recommendation of the planning commission 1 the site plan shall be accompanied by building elevations and landscape and master sign plans which shall be reviewed by the architectural review board for consistency with the overall objectives of the district the boards recommendation shall be forwarded to the planning and zoning commission for consideration in their recommendation to city council if applicable 2 a pd site plan shall terminate at the end of a twoyear period or more with an extension approved by the city council unless within such period a preliminary or master plat as required by the citys subdivision ordinance has been filed with the city for all of the land covered by the pd site plan in which case the site plan will remain valid as long as there is an approved plat for the property if a pd site plan terminates development of the land covered by the terminated plan cannot occur until a new pd site plan has been approved for the land as provided by this article  pd compliance with approved plans except as otherwise provided by the subdivision provisions of this unified development no development shall begin and no building permit shall be issued for any land within a pd district until a pd site plan that is consistent with the pd concept plan and applicable pd development plan has been approved each pd district shall be developed used and maintained in compliance
