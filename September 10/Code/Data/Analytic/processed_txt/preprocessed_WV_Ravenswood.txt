captioned history of ravenswood may be of interest the town of ravenswood was originally incorporated by the general assembly of virginia march 10th 1852 acts 185 chap 400  again by the legislature of west virginia feb 25th 1868 acts 186 chap 51  it is now controlled by chap 8 of the official west virginia on sept 2nd 189  of the records of the council appears an ordinance submitting to a vote the question of enlarging the corporate limits of the town as therein specified and on oct 4th 189  said ordinance is by the council declared adopted and said limits enlarged as therein specified by metes and bounds  at the november term of the circuit court 189 the said ordinance was approved and said limits established as specified which order is found in book no 14 on  of the law records of said court the legislature in its 1969 revision and consolidation of chapters 8 and 8a of the west virginia into a new recognized in section 816 that when the provisions of existing special legislative charters are compared with and are considered in the light of the provisions of this chapter ie the new chapter 8 there are five basic possibilities as to the relationship between such charter provisions and the provisions of this chapter namely 1 as to any particular charter provisions such charter provisions may be inconsistent or in conflict with the pertinent provisions of this chapter  2 although relating to the same subject matter and although not inconsistent or in conflict with any provisions of this chapter certain charter provisions may be sufficiently different from pertinent provisions of this chapter as to indicate as a matter of practical construction that either the charter provisions or the provisions of this chapter but not both should be applicable  3 although varying in certain respects certain charter provisions may be similar to and in essential harmony with corresponding provisions of this chapter  4 as to any particular charter provisions there may be no counterpart of such provisions in this chapter  and 5 as to any provisions of this chapter there may be no counterpart charter provisions therefore sets forth certain rules to be applied in addition to the usual and ordinary rules of statutory construction with respect to construction and applicability of legislative charters and it is suggested that users of this city code refer to wv
