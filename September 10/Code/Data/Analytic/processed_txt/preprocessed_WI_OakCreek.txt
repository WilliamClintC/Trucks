of oak creek 42 a the secondary effects of the activities defined and regulated in this section are detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such activities must be regulated as provided in this section b regulation of the adult entertainment industry is necessary because in the absence of such regulation significant criminal activity has historically and regularly occurred this history of criminal activity in the adult entertainment industry has included prostitution narcotics and liquor law violations breaches of the peace and the presence within the industry of individuals with hidden ownership interests and outstanding arrest warrants c the common council based on the experience of other cities including seattle and renton washington and detroit michigan has previously determined that adult oriented establishments can contribute to the impairment of the character and quality of surrounding residential neighborhoods and contribute to the decline and the value of surrounding properties d the common council has reviewed studies distributed by the national obscenity law center in a three volume set

intercourse sodomy oral copulation and masturbation resulting in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in said booths g contact between entertainers and patrons of adult entertainment businesses facilitates prostitution and other related crimes and the concern over unlawful sexual activities and related crimes is a legitimate health concern of the city which demands reasonable regulation of adult entertainment businesses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens h licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation i it is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment industry to prevent the exploitation of minors to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult to ensure that such entertainers have not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible and to ensure that such entertainers are not involved in criminal activity j it is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of establishments offering adult entertainment at such times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees k the license fees required in this section are nominal fees imposed as necessary regulatory measures designed to help defray the substantial expenses incurred by the city in regulating the adult entertainment industry l hidden ownership interests for the purpose of skimming profits and avoiding the payment of taxes have historically occurred in the adult entertainment industry in the absence of regulation these hidden ownership interests have historically been held by organized and whitecollar crime elements in order for the city to effectively protect the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry it is important that the city be fully apprised of the actual ownership of adult entertainment establishments m the common council desires to prevent these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of

1442 condominium developments a purpose 1 the common council hereby finds that certain issues arise in condominium developments that require limited applicability of this condominium developments the state legislature has recognized that subdivision ordinances may apply to condominiums but that subdivision ordinances shall not impose burdens upon condominiums that are different from those imposed on other property of a similar character not subject to a declaration of condominium 2 the factor that makes this to a condominium development is the creation of multiple distinct property entities at or near the ground surface subject to property taxation as separate parcels with each property entity having different ownership and management the city determines that this factor makes a condominium development dissimilar both physically and in ownership from developments in which the land and improvements are under unitary ownership management and control 3 thus the common council hereby finds that new condominium developments can place impacts on community resources in the same manner as other new developments which are characterized by division of land into lots these impacts include a additional population density b possibility of use of particular land in a manner unsuitable to the lands characteristics c additional demands upon city area parks recreation areas utility facilities and schools d additional traffic and street use b exceptions this not apply to the following condominiums 1 any condominium plat recorded prior to the effective date of this 2 any conversion of a

street overlay districts design standards coordinated efforts between the city of oak creek and the city of franklin have resulted in the creation of four overlay districts along the 27th street corridor within oak creek the intent of the 27th street overlay districts is to allow current permitted uses to maintain their permitted use standing while planning for coordinated development or redevelopment along the 27th street corridor whether the current use is permitted or special use does not change based on the overlay district zoning until the specific use changes at that time the new overlay district zoning and design standards come in effect the intent of the design standards is to provide creative ideas stimulate forward thinking promote quality design and preserve designated woodlands and wetlands as well as ensure that the construction of buildings facilities and properties are compatible with their surroundings are attractive and enhance the corridor and building design and development standards established by the city of oak creek these design standards shall apply to se  regional retail overlay district useofficeurban village overlay district use neighborhood overlay district and use office overlay district and as shown on the official zoning map a general design guidelines 1 establish and improve the visual character of the 27th street

in a new generation of telecommunication services these new services transmit electromagnetic waves of such a frequency and power that will likely require numerous antenna locations these antennas may be located on buildings water towers and other similar structures but will also frequently be located on new or enlarged towers this requires that the city of oak creek regulate these wireless communication system facilities in a different manner than conventional television and radio transmission towers which are able to transmit their signals at much greater distances a number of providers of wireless communication services have recently been licensed by the federal communications commission and additional providers are expected to be licensed in the near future these firms are expected to pursue antenna sites within the city of oak creek and these efforts are expected to include requests to construct new communication towers the intent of this proposed regulation is to provide for the establishment and or expansion of wireless telecommunication services within the city of oak creek while protecting neighborhoods and minimizing the adverse visual and operational effects of wireless telecommunications facilities design siting and screening more specifically this regulation has been developed in order to  maximize use of existing and approved towers and other structures to accommodate new antennas and transmitters in order to reduce the number of communication towers needed to serve the community   encourage providers to colocate their facilities on a single tower   minimize the location of facilities in visually sensitive areas   encourage creative design measures to camouflage facilities   protect residential areas from potential adverse impacts of communication towers   avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure careful siting of tower structures b location preferences the locations for siting the equipment involved in receiving or transmitting electromagnetic waves associated with wireless telecity of oak creek 1799 communication services are listed in the following order of preference 1 on existing structures such as buildings water towers and utility poles 2 on existing towers that otherwise meet local state and federal regulations 3 on new towers less than 100 feet in height located in institutional zones 4
