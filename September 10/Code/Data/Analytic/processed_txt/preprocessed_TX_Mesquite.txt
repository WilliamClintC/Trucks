drainage areas less than one hundred sixty 160 acres  rational method computation of stormwater runoff for drainage areas less than one hundred sixty 160 acres shall be by the rational method which is based on the principle that the maximum rate of runoff from a given drainage area for an assumed rainfall intensity occurs when all parts of the area are contributing to the flow at the point of discharge the formula for calculation of runoff by the rational method is equation 1 q   cia where q   the maximum rate of discharge expressed in cubic feet per second c   a runoff coefficient which varies with the topography soil land use and moisture content of the soil at the time the runoff producing rainfall occurs this runoff coefficient shall be based on the ultimate use of the land as

the rainfall intensity is found by referring to the applicable curves of figure 1 time of concentration or duration of rainfall for use in figure 1 shall be calculated by velocity data shown in table 2 time of concentration is the longest time without interruption of flow by detention devices that a drop of water takes to flow from the farthest point of the drainage area to the point of

small onsite detention facilities for maintaining the rate of runoff as if the property was developed as singlefamily residential uses the detention effects of large regional detention facilities can be taken into account in unit hydrograph methods circumstances that may require the use of a unit hydrograph method include sizing open channels reclaiming floodplains creating lakes or building other types of drainagerelated facilities on major drainage courses design engineers of these types of facilities should be aware that the requirement of designing for fully developed watershed conditions will mean that they will have to calculate these fully developed flows instead of using the flows calculated in the federal emergency management agencys fema flood insurance studies for mesquite femas

creek at the development to the development area is fifteen 15 or greater for ratios of less than fifteen 15 the onehundredyear water surface will be used on the receiving creek not only is it important to use the proper starting elevation for the hydraulic gradient but proper hydraulic gradient elevations must be maintained for the length of the conduit the inside top of the conduit should be at or below the hydraulic gradient however effort should be made to keep the top of the pipe as close to the hydraulic gradient as possible so that deep excavations to lay pipe are not required when the conduit is flowing partially full the hydraulic gradient shall be shown at the inside crown of the conduit the hydraulic gradient shall be kept two 2 feet below the top of curb if this cannot be obtained the hydraulic gradient shall be at least 15 v 1 2  2g feet below the gutter line where v 1 is the velocity in the lateral e minor head losses when establishing the hydraulic gradient of a

elevations shall be used to establish the capacity of laterals and the corresponding depth of flooding g outfalls to open channels and lakes the flow lines of storm sewer conduits that discharge into open channels shall match the flow line of the channel one 1 exception to this requirement of matching the flow line is when a storm sewer discharges into a concretelined channel or when the outfall is submerged below the normal water surface of a lake in the case of a pipe discharging to a lined channel the outlet must be below the top of the channel lining the second exception pertains to storm sewer discharge that must cross wide floodplain areas under this condition the storm sewer could discharge into a lined ditch which would convey runoff to the flow line of the channel without creating an erosive condition permissible velocities within the ditch will be based on the type of lining used and the velocities provided in table 4 flumes to bring the discharge down to the flow line of earthen creeks shall not be permitted drop structures shall be allowed upon written approval of the city engineer the velocity at the discharge end of the conduit shall be computed based on partial flow depth and shall be sufficiently low so as to not cause downstream erosion problems table 4 shows the maximum velocities allowed in various types of channels which are then the maximum discharge velocities at storm sewer outfalls in some circumstances the configuration of the storm sewer in relation to the flow line of the creek may cause excessive velocities to be reached unless provisions are made to slow the velocity one 1 recommended method of slowing the velocity is to have the last length of pipe a length of at least ten 10 times the diameter be on a slope that will reduce the partial flow outlet velocity to the values shown in table 4 for the receiving stream stilling basins shall also be allowed to reduce discharge velocities the discharge pipe shall also intersect minor creeks at an angle not to exceed sixty 60 degrees minor creeks are defined as those creeks channels or drainageways where the distance from the pipe outlet to the opposite creek bank at the bottom of the channel is twenty 20 feet or less pipes may intersect major creeks greater than twenty 20 feet to opposite bank at a ninetydegree angle the city engineer may require that pipes intersect major creeks at an angle not to exceed sixty 60 degrees when a ninetydegree angle would result in an erosive condition figure 20 shows how a storm sewer should be configured to discharge into a creek h

retail and restaurant area overlay district 4801  purpose and scope the town east area has emerged as the major business center for eastern dallas county the pattern of growth in the area has created a concentration of retail and entertainment uses restaurants and theaters unforeseen at the time most of the area zoning was adopted because of the concentration of these uses the orientation of the area to family services the congestion of traffic and the critical importance of the area in the citys tax structure some modification of zoning regulation is deemed necessary to assure the ongoing viability of the businesses and the value of their improvements through the adoption of an overlay district selected regulations can be adjusted as needed without unnecessarily revising other aspects of the current zoning the overlay approach therefore provides the least disruptive method of addressing the needed issues the overlay district will accommodate further development of retail restaurants theaters and selected entertainment uses similar to the existing development diversification to office and hotel uses is encouraged both due to the synergy that the variety of uses can create as well as for the differentiated traffic pattern created by these uses ie traffic generated at times other than the current retail peaks on the other hand the overlay will restrict uses which might be detrimental to the overall viability and integrity of the area specifically uses with the following characteristics are restricted 1 uses which generate truck traffic or display other traffic characteristics which would create greater disruption in this area due to the already congested traffic conditions 2 uses with visual or aesthetic characteristics which are normally not present or desirable in a quality retailentertainment area 3 uses with disruptive characteristics which are generally only accommodated in heavy commercial areas or which are generally incompatible with family and customeroriented retail and entertainment uses  61796 4802  terra  town east retail and restaurant area prefix the terra prefix designation constitutes a zoning overlay district and the addition

20 corridor annexation of the area was preceded by a yearlong study of the economic impacts of growth in the corridor the study concluded that annexation could produce a net positive economic benefit for the city if residential and commercial growth occurred in an orderly manner and at certain requisite densities the territory was annexed into the city under the default agricultural zoning
