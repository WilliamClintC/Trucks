this article the borough council of tamaqua borough finds and declares that the land application of sewage sludge in tamaqua borough poses a significant threat to the health safety and welfare of the citizens and environment of tamaqua borough in april 200 the inspector general of the environmental protection agency epa which oversees state sewage sludge regulations issued a report in which it concluded epa cannot assure the public that current land application of sewage sludge practices are protective of human health and the environment among the inspector generals concerns were the following failure to properly manage sludge may have adverse effects on human health and the environment  epa does not have an effective program of ensuring compliance with land application requirements  and state officials have criticized the lack of epa oversight staffing and commitment toward ensuring the safety of land applied sludge in 199 elevenyearold tony behun from rush township centre county pennsylvania died from a staph infection shortly after being exposed to sewage sludge the following year seventeenyearold daniel pennock from reading pennsylvania died from a staph infection shortly after being exposed to sewage sludge the us environmental protection agency epa recognizes staph as a potential pathogenic component of sewage sludge in spite of these risks tamaqua borough has been rendered powerless by the state and federal government to prohibit the land application of sewage sludge by persons that comply with all applicable laws and regulations in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the residents of tamaqua borough the soil groundwater and surface water the environment and its flora and fauna and the practice of sustainable agriculture the borough finds it necessary to ban corporations and other limited liability entities from engaging in the land application of sewage sludge it is recognized that a small number of waste management corporations control the vast majority of sludge hauling and land application and that corporate concentration enables those corporations to define waste management practices at the state level to the detriment of municipal communities it is also recognized that limited liability shields prevent financial recovery and accountability for damages caused by business entities because limited liability insulates the persons managing the corporation from harms caused by their decisions finally the borough recognizes that corporations wielding governmentconferred constitutional powers against the municipal government renders the borough council unable to guarantee to its citizens a republican form of government in the borough in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the residents of tamaqua borough the soil groundwater and surface water the environment and its flora and fauna and the practice of sustainable agriculture it is necessary to test each load of sewage sludge to be applied by persons before it is land applied within the borough to determine if the level of pollutants pathogens or vector attractants exceeds the levels allowed under applicable laws and regulations

limited in the type of nonagricultural land uses allowed therefore the only allowable residential uses permitted in these districts are singlefamily detached dwellings 4 the intensity of development eg how many lots or development units are allowed to be created from a farm is more restricted in the eap and ap zoning districts than in other zoning districts in the esp region the intent of cluster

where two 2 or more of these categories overlap the overlapping acreage shall be counted only once using the most restrictive classification the acreages of these various topographic features shall be added together and this total acreage figure shall be referred to as the deducted acreage d the gross acreage of the parent tract minus the deducted acreage is then multiplied by the open space coefficient the percentage of the parent tract required to be preserved as open space andor agricultural land as stated in subsection b5 the resultant figure is the amount of area available for the cluster development of single family detached dwellings as an example an eap parent tract is 100 gross acres the deducted acreage for the features indicated in subsection c3bii is 20 acres which results in 80 acres 10020 to be multiplied by 070 70% open space the result is 56 acres 80 x 070 which must be preserved and 24 acres 8056 which is available for cluster development d neighborhood
