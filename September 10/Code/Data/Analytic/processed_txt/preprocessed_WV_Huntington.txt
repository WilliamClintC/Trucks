comparative tables appearing in the back of this the reader can locate any section of the 1986 as supplemented and any subsequent ordinance included herein the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage notes which tie related sections of the which refer to relevant state law have been included a table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the included at the back of this system the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes chapters articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code article and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the article number is 305 or the 5th article within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and article numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the article number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the article number is 113 or the 13th article within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes chapters and articles initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation articles are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law

federal categorical pretreatment standards required users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards upon the promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standard for a particular industrial subcategory the federal standards if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article the board shall notify all affected users of the applicable federal standards and the applicable reporting requirements under 40 cfr such as the baseline monitoring report the categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 cfr subchapter n parts 405471 are hereby incorporated a user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 cfr 40313 that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from fdf the factors considered by epa when developing the categorical pretreatment standard the board maintains the authority to incorporate or recognize a revised standard if the user has obtained an fdf variance from epa on the basis of 40 cfr 40313 that cius standards would be replaced by the revised fdf variance standard a where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater the board may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with section 93312e and f see 40 cfr 4036c b when the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production the board may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users in accordance with 40 cfr 4036c2 c when wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard the board shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 cfr 4036e d a ciu may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with the following paragraphs of this section and in accordance with 40 cfr 40315 1 categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the board upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis ie adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the requirements of paragraph 2 of this section are met 2 criteria a either i the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis  or ii the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters b credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere c credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section d credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the potw discharges the board may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result e when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the board convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the board the board may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in sections 93312 e1a e1e below 1 to be eligible for equivalent mass limits the industrial user must a employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its individual wastewater discharge permit  b currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment  c provide sufficient information to establish the facilitys actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device as well as the facilitys longterm average production rate both the actual average daily flow rate and the longterm average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions  d not have daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the discharge  and e have consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial users request for equivalent mass limits 2 an industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must a maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits  b continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  c continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the board whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20 percent from its baseline production rates determined in section 93312e1c upon notification of a revised production rate the board will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and d continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to paragraphs 93312e1a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit 3 when developing equivalent mass limits the board a will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  b upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and c may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to section 93316 the industrial user must also be in compliance with section  regarding the prohibition of bypass f the board may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the board g once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section 93312 in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived in accordance with 40 cfr 4036c7 h many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation in accordance with 40 cfr 4036c8 i any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the board within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the board of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate in accordance with 40 cfr 4036c9 1 93313  specific pollutant limitations no person shall discharge wastewater containing heavy metals and similar objectionable or toxic substances to such a degree that the concentration measured in the composite discharge to the potw for any one day the normal operating period exceeds the following daily maximum allowable discharge limits as assessed utilizing composite samples grab samples or a series of grab samples at the discretion of the board a the board is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 cfr 4035c b the following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass interference no person shall discharge

result in a condition of pass interference damage collection facilities or be detrimental to the treatment processes the above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the potw all concentrations for metallic substances are for total metals unless indicated otherwise the board may impose mass limitations in addition to the concentrationbased limitations above the limits and pollutants set forth above may be amended either in the article or in a significant industrial users permit from time to time as deemed necessary by the board to protect the facilities and ensure the potws compliance with applicable npdes permit conditions and water quality standards c the board may develop best management practices bmps by article or in individual wastewater discharge permits or general permits to implement local limits and the requirements of section 93311 1  2  footnotes    the tto limit of 213 mgl remains in effect unless a specific industrial user can more technically evaluate a limit for each and every tto constituent the industrial user must be able to demonstrate that the proposed limit will comply with all of the requirements of title 40 cfr 4035 the industrial user must be able to demonstrate that concentrations of an individual pollutants above 213 mgl will not cause pass interference and will not result in the presence of toxic gases vapors and fumes in the potw in amounts that may cause acute worker health and safety problems all proposals shall be subject to the boards approval the board also reserves the right to impose limits on individual compounds more stringent than 213 mgl in order to fulfill the requirements contained in 40 cfr 4035 93314  state requirements state requirements and limitations wv 47 csr on discharges shall apply in

will be capable of treating certain abnormal industrial wastes as heretofore defined in sections 93301 and 93302 the actual treatment of such wastes may increase the cost of operating and maintaining the citys potw therefore there is hereby levied and assessed against each person industry or corporation discharging more than 40000 cubic feet per month of such abnormal industrial waste into the potw a surcharge or surcharges which are intended to cover such additional cost to the board such surcharges shall be in addition to the regular sewerage service charge set forth in sections 93320 to 93327 and shall be payable as hereinafter provided in the amount hereinafter provided no industrial user will be subject to both bod and chlorine requirement surcharges this will prevent double charging for chlorine the surcharges provided for in sections 93328 to 93332 shall be added to the normal sewerage service charge set forth in sections 93320 to 93327 they shall be billed monthly and shall be subject to the same penalty as set forth in section 93322 for delayed payment fee 1 93329  sampling the strength of any industrial waste the discharge of which is to be subject to surcharge shall be determined monthly or more frequently from samples taken at the manhole described in section 93342 or at any other sampling point mutually agreed to by the board and the producer of such waste the frequency and duration of the sampling period shall be as such in the opinion of the board will permit a reasonably reliable determination of the average composition of the wastes exclusive of storm water runoff representative samples of the wastewater discharge shall be collected by a representative of the board in proportion to the flow of waste exclusive of storm water runoff and composited for analysis in accordance with the current revision of 40 cfr 136 upon request by the industrial user the board may split samples with the industrial user for their own analysis except as hereinafter provided the strength of the waste so found by analysis shall be used for establishing the surcharge or surcharges however the board may if it so elects accept the results of routine sampling and analyses by the producer of such wastes in lieu of or in addition to making its own samplings and analyses 1 93330  chlorine requirement in the event any industrial waste the average volume of which exceeds 40000 cubic feet per month is found by the board to have a chlorine requirement in excess of 25 parts per million or 25 ppm the producer of such waste shall be surcharged an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes in hundred cubic feet per billing period exclusive of storm water runoff discharged to the potw and the chlorine requirement surcharge rate the chlorine requirement surcharge rate shall be determined by the following formula rc    pc c  25 where rc   the chlorine requirement surcharge rate in cents per 100 cubic feet of waste discharged pc   the average cost of chlorine to the city in cents per pound c   the average chlorine requirement of the industrial waste expressed in parts per million ppm as determined in accordance with or 93331 the figure 25 appearing in the above formula corresponds to the maximum chlorine requirement permissible without surcharge the figure  is the factor to convert parts per million to pounds per 100 cubic feet no discount shall be permitted for sewage or industrial wastes having a chlorine requirement of less than 25 parts per million it is recognized that the chlorine requirement of certain undiluted chemical wastes may be difficult to determine because of excessive concentrations of interfering substances in such instances the waste may first be diluted with municipal sewage portions of the diluted waste and the sewage used in making the dilution shall then be allowed to stand at room temperature approximately 68 degrees f for a period of not less than two hours or more than eight hours the chlorine requirement of each shall then be determined and the chlorine requirement of the undiluted waste computed by the following formula c   m v1 + v2  sv2 where c   the chlorine requirement of the waste to be used in the formula of section 93330 m   the chlorine requirement of the mixed sewage and waste in parts per million s   the chlorine requirement of the sewage used for dilution in parts per million v1   the volume of waste used in the mixture v2   the volume of sewage used in the mixture in the application of this procedure the volumes of waste and diluting sewage used shall be such that the ratio of v1 to v1 + v2 is approximately equal to the ratio of the average daily flow of wastes in question to the average daily flow of sewage entering the treatment works this procedure shall be used only in those instances where the board believes its use to be necessary or desirable in order to determine the equitable chlorine requirement surcharge rate since the above stipulated surcharge is only intended to compensate the board for the additional cost of chlorinating abnormal industrial wastes it shall only be applied during those periods when the board is actually using chlorine in the event the board uses chlorine for only a portion of some given billing period then the surcharge for that particular period as computed in accordance with section 93330 shall be reduced by the percentage of such period during which no chlorine is used 1 93331  suspended solids concentration suspended solids surcharging will be included within a significant industrial

conduit standards 96001  legislative findings the council of the city of huntington finds that 1 demand for access to highspeed telecommunications services is growing in order to fill such demand telecommunications service providers install telecommunication lines in public rightsofway 2 in other jurisdictions the demand for access and the number of telecommunications service providers has sometimes resulted in multiple serial excavations within the public rightsofway each such excavation can and does result in traffic disruption a weakening of pavement integrity and a shortening of the useful life of paved surfaces 3 the city of huntington has not experienced a high demand for use of the public rightsofway by telecommunications service providers but in order to responsibly manage its public rightsofway the city should anticipate such demand in the future and plan accordingly 4 requiring that conduit be installed in newly constructed public streets and rightsofway in order to accommodate the anticipated future demand for access to telecommunications services will assist the city in responsibly managing its public rightsofway by a reducing or eliminating the need for excavation within public streets and rightsofway when telecommunications service providers seek to locate underground telecommunications facilities within such streets and rightsofway in the future  b reduce or eliminate the traffic disruption that occurs whenever excavation occurs within streets and public rightsofway  c reduce or eliminate the loss of pavement integrity and diminishment of the useful life of pavement that occurs whenever paved streets and rightsofway are cut and excavated within  and d meet the needs and desires of the public for access to highspeed telecommunications services and the needs and desires of telecommunications service providers to locate within the public streets and rightsofway 5 in residential areas anticipated demand for the reasonable future can likely be met by the capacity provided by two telecommunication lines in nonresidential areas anticipated demand is higher but can likely be met for the reasonable future by the capacity provided by four telecommunication lines requiring the installation of conduit and other facilities necessary to support these lines will allow anticipated needs to be met while allowing the city to responsibly manage its rightsofway 1  96002  intent the intent of this section is to provide for the construction of infrastructure sufficient to allow telecommunications service providers desiring to deploy communication lines in the future to do so by pulling the same conduit and appurtenances installed pursuant to this section and without excavating within the rightofway this section is not intended to require telecommunications service providers to install additional ducts or conduit but is intended to require those constructing public streets including the city and private developers to provide and install such conduit and appurtenances as may be necessary to accommodate future telecommunications needs within public streets and rightsofway without further excavation or disturbance 1  96003  requirementsadoption of standards whenever any new public street is constructed whether by the city as a public works project or by a private party in conjunction with development the following shall

standards the construction standards shall specify the minimum diameter of the conduit and interducts and the minimum number of interducts to meet the requirements of this section 5 all conduit and appurtenances installed by private parties pursuant to this section shall be conveyed and dedicated to the city with the dedication and conveyance of the public street andor rightofway 6 any and all installation costs shall be the responsibility of the party constructing the public street 1  96004  use by telecommunications service providers whenever conduit installed or to be installed under this section is available or will become available within a newly constructed public streets or rightofway upon dedication all telecommunications service providers thereafter locating telecommunication lines within such street or rightofway shall be required to locate their communication lines within such conduit unless it can be demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the public works director that such location is not technologically feasible or reasonably practicable conduit capacity shall be allocated to telecommunications service providers on a firstcome firstserved basis  provided that the city may reserve capacity within such conduits for its own use  and provided further that the public works director may adopt additional rules for conduit allocation in order to ensure that all telecommunications service providers have reasonable access to the citys rightsofway and that no barriers to entry or competition result from the allocation of conduit space 1  96005  fees the city reserves the right to charge reasonable fees for the use of conduit installed pursuant to this section to the extent consistent with and as limited by federal and

may not be achievable on every site due to other constraints architectural treatments can achieve the same effect parking should be located at the rear and side of buildings d entrances and porches are often the focus of buildings particularly when they occur on primary elevations together with their functional and decorative features such as doors steps balustrades pilasters and entablatures

predominant roof shape and pitch of existing adjacent buildings where flat roofs appear historically they almost always project beyond the facade line and are frequently supported by brackets new roofs should follow the traditional types gabled gambrel hipped and mansard roofing material shall be unobtrusive and not call attention to itself except on buildings where pattern is a part of the overall design asphalt shingle is acceptable provided it is a relatively dark shade random mingling of shingle shapes and colors should not be permitted and consideration should be given to whether

have been published regarding historic paint colors at various periods in american architectural history including century of color published by the american life foundation in 1981  it would be desirable if these were consulted prior to choosing a color colors should be compatible with the historic districts atmosphere and typical of the period from which the architectural style was
