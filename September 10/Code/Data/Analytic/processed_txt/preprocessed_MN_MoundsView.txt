the repair and replacement work results in a greater benefit to some properties and not to others the council should consider establishing a different assessment rate based on the benefits received f sanitary sewer and water trunk improvements trunk sewer and water mains are usually designed to carry larger volumes of flow than are necessary within an immediate property area in order to serve additional properties beyond the area of their immediate placement therefore one hundred percent 100% of the cost of trunk improvements will be assessed on a unit basis to all properties within a

property within drainage districts that would receive benefit from a trunk storm sewer would be assessed a unit amount of four hundred dollars $40000 per lot for a single family residential lot this amount would be determined and adjusted annually by resolution using the engineering news record enr multifamily housing lots that exceed onethird 13 acre would be assessed based on the number of acres multiplied by the unit cost of one thousand two hundred dollars $120000 per acre commercialindustrial property would be assessed based on the number of acres that are determined to benefit from the trunk line multiplied by the unit cost of one thousand two hundred dollars $120000 per acre to a maximum amount of three 3 acres or three thousand six hundred dollars $360000 the remaining cost will be paid for by the storm water surface utility andor by an ad valorem property tax paid by the entire community or by other funds that may become available to the city for infrastructure cost

assessment the objective is to choose an assessment method which will arrive at a reasonable fair and equitable assessment which will be uniform upon the same class of property within the assessed area the most frequently recognized assessment methods are the unit assessment the front footage assessment and the area assessment depending upon the individual project any one 1 or a combination of these methods may be utilized to arrive at an appropriate cost distribution city staff will consider all methods and weigh their applicability to the project and present a recommendation to the city council in the form of a mock assessment roll or rolls a description of each assessment and its corresponding policy application is presented a separate section  will identify the appropriate matchup of method with a specific type of project and analyze why each is generally used the purpose of assessment formulas is to allocate assessed costs among benefited properties the formula should result in an allocation of assessments which is reasonably related to the benefit received any one 1 predetermined formula will not be appropriate in all cases because of circumstances unique to the relationship between the specific project and the specific properties benefited when considering an assessment method or formula for any given project it may be necessary to combine assessment methods or to modify the methods described below therefore the following description of methods of assessments should be regarded as guidelines which may not be appropriate in all cases city of mounds view 20209 20209 rev 200 b unit assessment a unit assessment shall be derived by dividing the total project cost by the number of residential equivalent density red units in the project area a red unit is defined as a single family residential unit all platted and unplatted property will be assigned red unit values equivalent to the underlying zoning when the existing land use is less than the highest and best permitted use the council may consider the current use as well as the full potential of land use in determining the appropriate number of red units otherwise the following red chart will apply on a per unit basis subject to adjustment by the council for any inequities single family 100 red duplex 100 red condominium 080 red multifamily 3 units or more 080 red townhouse 080 red commercial 200 units industrial 200 units the unit approach has proven to be the best method in those instances whereby the improvement largely benefits everyone to the same degree and the cost of the improvement is not generally affected by parcel size c area assessment the assessable area shall be expressed in terms of the number of acres or the number of square feet subject to assessment when determining the assessable area the following considerations will be given 1 ponding assessment consideration lakes ponds and swamps may be considered a part of the assessable area of a parcel 2 road rightofway assessment consideration up to twenty percent 20% of the gross acreage may be deducted for street rightofway purposes within unplatted parcels of five acres or more depending upon the parcel configuration and is only applicable to single family residential use parcels of less than five 5 acres may not qualify and may be assessed full acreage the reason for this size restriction is that in most instances parcels of less than five 5 acres cannot support an internal public road system 3 park dedication assessment consideration when park land is dedicated as part of a residential development as required by subdivisions the developer shall not be assessed an acreage charge on the portion of land dedicated city of mounds view 20209 20209 d front footage assessment the actual physical dimensions of a parcel abutting an improvement ie street sewer water etc will generally not be construed as the frontage utilized to calculate the assessment for a particular parcel rather an adjusted front footage will be determined the purpose of this method is to equalize assessment calculations for lots of similar size individual parcels by their very nature differ considerably in shape and area the following procedures will apply when calculating adjusted front footage the selection of the appropriate procedures will be determined by the specific configuration of the parcel all measurements will be scaled from available plat and section maps and will be rounded down to the nearest onehalf 12 foot dimension with any excess fraction deleted e categorical type descriptions are as follows standard variation desac shaped frontage ultimate objective of these procedures is to arrive at a fair and equitable distribution of cost whereby consideration is given to lot size and parcels are comparably assessed 1 standard this instance the adjusted front footage for rectangular lots would be the actual front footage of the lot the frontage measured shall be the lot width at the front lot line city of mounds view 20209 20209 2 rectangular variation a lot which is approximately rectangular and uniform in shape the adjusted front footage is computed by averaging the front and back sides of the lot this method is used only where the divergence between front and rear lot lines is twenty 20 feet or less 3 triangular a triangular shaped lot the adjusted front footage is computed by averaging the front and back lot lines the measurement at the back lot line shall not exceed a maximum distance in depth of one hundred fifty 150 feet city of mounds view 20209 20209 4 culdesac adjusted front footage for those lots that exist on culdesacs will be calculated at the midsection of the lot at the most reasonably defined and determinable position this line will be computed by connecting the midpoints of the two 2 side lot lines or if the lots are similar in nature and configuration a common lot width such as the standard setback of thirty 30 feet may be assigned based upon an evaluation of typical lots within the subdivision 5 curved certain situations such as those where lots are located along meandering trail system streets read patterns create curvilineal frontages in such instances the adjusted front footage will be the width of the lot measured at the midpoint of the shortest side lot line city of mounds view 20209 20209 6 irregularly shaped many cases unplatted parcels that are legally described by a metes and bounds description are irregular and odd shaped the adjusted front footage will be calculated by measuring the lot width at the thirty 30 foot building setback line 7 corner on a corner lot one hundred percent 100% of the adjusted front footage of the short side will be assessed and twentyfive percent 25% of the adjusted front footage of the long side will be assessed for improvements benefiting the respective sides the length of the property sides and not the orientation of the principal building shall determine adjusted front footage in this case a series of lots two 2 or more under common ownership shall be considered as one 1 parcel or lot for determining which is the short or long side of a property however this shall only apply to series of lots on which only one 1 principal building is situated city of mounds view 20209 20209 rev 597 b general commercial zoned corner adjusted front footage shall be the entire frontage of the side of the lot immediately abutting the improvement  8 flag which utilize a narrow private easement or maintain ownership of access to their property exceeding a minimum length of one hundred twenty five 125 feet thereby having a small frontage on a street will be assigned an adjusted front footage of seventy five 75 feet this dimension is consistent with the subdivision ordinance which prescribes such length as the minimum lot frontage along a public roadway the adjusted front footage for flag lots whose driveway access is under one

municipality is a resource to be developed in a manner which will result in minimum damage to the quality of life and to property and threat to health and reductions of private and public economic loss caused by drainage problems subd 2 the existing drainage system in mounds view in general adequately meets the needs of the city however the storm drainage system will not in the future provide adequate or proper drainage in those areas of the city subject to substantial residential commercial or industrial development unless the large increase in storm water runoff that is known to result from such development is properly controlled and regulated the consequence of not restricting such increase in runoff would be to subject a major portion of the lands of the city to high water tables drainage problems storm water flooding by heavy rains inadequate drainage facilities causing erosion damage to property disruption of residential commercial and governmental services unsanitary conditions and interruptions of transportation all of which would be detrimental to the health safety welfare and property of affected residents of the city  1 see also subdivision 607033o and of this
