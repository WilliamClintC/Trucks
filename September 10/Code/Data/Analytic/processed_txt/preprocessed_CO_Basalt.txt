this special review process is established to provide for review to determine if these specific uses and allowances are appropriate without establishing numerous separate zoning classifications it is the intent of this provide a review of such uses and approval if appropriate so that the community is assured that the proposed uses are compatible with the location and surrounding land uses    when allowed a within each zoning district certain land uses are permitted by right by special review or prohibited special review uses may be permitted in designated districts upon approval by the town council b in addition the town council may also permit certain flexibility to the schedule of requirements outlined in established towns zoning districts review when specifically provided for in this

granted unless the applicant demonstrates that the development of the property will not pose an unreasonable risk to the health and safety of the public or other property owners the applicants ability to pay for mitigation measures required by these regulations shall not be considered in determining if there is a hardship d density and floor area calculation formulas the following density and floor area calculation formulas shall apply to any property that contains slopes of thirty percent 30% or greater regardless of whether development is proposed on those slopes 1 puds and subdivisions the density and floor area calculations applicable to proposed puds and subdivisions puds and subdivisions which were approved subsequent to  the date on which the town adopted a floor area exclusion for thirty percent 30% slopes and amendments to approved puds and subdivisions shall be as follows a lands with a slope of less than thirty percent 30% one hundred percent 100% of land area counts towards density and floor area calculations b lands with a slope of thirty percent 30% or greater zero percent 0% of land area counts towards density and floor area calculations c for subdivisions and puds approved subsequent to 198 the floor area shall be as permitted in the towns subdivision or pud approval 2 other lots and parcels the density and floor area calculations applicable to all other lots

parcel be less than two thousand one hundred 2100 square feet unless the lot or parcels allowed floor area prior to applying this formula is already less than two thousand one hundred 2100 square feet in which case that lower number shall be the lot or parcels allowed floor area and provided the proposed development complies with the applicable site planning standards in subsection e below provided also that the floor area reduction formula shall not apply to any lot or parcel on which 1 no development is proposed on a slope that is thirty percent 30% or greater  2 the closest faade of any building or structure is located ten 10 feet or more from the top of slope  and 3 the proposed development does not require the applicant to submit any other land use application for which town council approval would be required 3 relief from formulas an applicant who wishes to obtain relief from the restrictions of the density and floor area calculation formulas on his lot may do so by submitting an application for special review pursuant to or by obtaining a variance pud process pursuant to of this e site planning standards applications that are subject to these steep slope regulations shall demonstrate their compliance with the following site planning standards 1 overall site plan a setback from top of slope when development is placed on the top of a slope that is greater than thirty percent 30% the faade of any structure shall be set back by a minimum of ten feet 10 from the top of that slope b development to occur on lesser slopes when a property contains some lands with a slope of less than thirty percent 30% and some lands with a slope of greater than thirty percent 30% the area of the property having a slope of less than thirty percent 30% is the preferred portion of the site in which to accommodate the development and shall be utilized to the extent practical however development may occur along the toe of a thirty percent 30% slope or if it is not practical to develop on a slope of less than thirty percent 30% then along the slope itself if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the town planner or other applicable review body that the development is reasonable and safe from an engineering and slope stability standpoint and does not cause unnecessary impacts on the slope onto which it is being built in doing so the applicant shall demonstrate that the development has been designed to appropriately account for the following factors as applicable to the site in question 1 the stability of the slope and whether disturbing that slope could pose a hazard to occupants of the property or neighboring properties 2 the presence or absence of vegetation on the slope and whether development on the slope would result in the loss of mature vegetation that helps to stabilize the slope 3 whether there are natural or unique features or valued neighborhood characteristics on the flat portions of the site that could be preserved by locating some of the development at the toe of the slope or on the steeper slopes 4 the prevailing development pattern on the surrounding lots and whether development has typically occurred on the flat area of the property or has taken place on the steeper lands note this factor shall not apply to properties accessed off of an alley 5 the ability of the proposed development to keep all site impacts such as drainage and erosion within the confines of the site during and following construction c preserve natural features whenever possible development should be located to preserve significant natural site features such as prominent landforms rock outcrops mature trees and vegetation and drainage courses developing in already disturbed areas of a site is preferred to disturbance of natural areas d avoid unstable slopes development shall be located so as to avoid areas that the town determines are subject to slope instability and rockfall hazards except as provided in the following circumstance where a project is not able to fully avoid these hazards development may be permitted if an engineer or geologist licensed in the state of colorado demonstrates that the hazard will be safely mitigated and appropriate mitigation measures are employed mitigation measures may include but are not limited to 1 slope stabilization via grading revegetation retaining walls soil nail or micropile systems or other accepted designs  2 stabilization of rocks via bolting gunite application cementing removal of unstable rocks scaling cribbing installation of retaining or catchment walls and other accepted practices  3 slowing diverting or channelizing rocks or debris flows using fences screens dams concrete barriers or diversion facilities around vulnerable structures  and 4 designing structures to withstand the impacts from rocks and other geologic hazards by reinforcing uphill walls windows and doors or by having no windows or doors on uphill walls e avoid driveway cuts across steep slopes to the extent practical development should be placed close to where an existing road or driveway enters a property so as to avoid having the driveway cut across an existing steep slope to access another portion of the site this means that if the road accesses the property at the toe of a slope then development should occur at the toe of the slope while if the road accesses the property at the top of the slope then development should occur at the top of the slope 2 grading standards a developments within the r3tn zone district terracing as seen throughout the r3tn zone district hill district is permitted to occur on slopes in excess of thirty percent 30% in order to create a flat bench or building pad or to create a garden or lawn area as this is consistent with the historical development of this area of town b developments in areas not zoned r3tn in areas of town not zoned r3tn that have slopes in excess of thirty percent 30% development should be designed to minimize the need for earth moving or disturbance for example cutting and grading to create a flat bench or building pad should be avoided to the maximum extent possible building designs that require excessive cut and fill shall not be allowed instead buildings should be designed to follow the sites natural contours and building foundations should be stepped along the slope to limit the need for cutting and filling driveways should be designed to follow the sites natural contours whenever possible and should take up the grade of the slope rather than cutting into or manipulating the topography c manmade slopes where grading excavation or filling is necessary creation of slopes of twentyfive percent 25% or less is strongly encouraged cut or filled manmade slopes shall not exceed a slope of fifty percent 50% unless a soils engineering or technical report is submitted demonstrating that the cut or fill will be stable d recontour cut and filled slopes all cut filled and graded slopes shall be recontoured to blend with the natural varied contours of the surrounding undisturbed terrain abrupt angular transitions and linear slopes should be avoided to the extent possible e retaining walls retaining walls used to support steep slopes shall not exceed six 6 feet in height except when terracing is employed or as needed to construct a structures foundation wall terracing should be limited to two 2 tiers the width of the terrace between retaining walls that are up to four 4 feet in height should be at least three 3 feet retaining walls greater than four 4 feet in height should be separated from other retaining walls by at least five 5 horizontal feet and shall be based on the design of a professional engineer terraces shall be permanently landscaped or revegetated pursuant to the standards in e3a below 3 vegetation preservation and landscaping a revegetation is required areas disturbed by development shall be revegetated plant material used to revegetate these areas shall be noninvasive and should be lowwater using and indigenous to the neighborhood in which the property is located for the purpose of this standard indigenous means naturalized to a given geographic area the town has prepared a list of indigenous plant materials that can be obtained from the town planner or town horticulturalist proposals to revegetate with plant materials that are not on the list of indigenous plant materials shall be subject to review and approval by the town horticulturalist and town planner in evaluating the appropriateness of using nonindigenous materials on a particular site the town horticulturalist and town planner may consider the type and composition of plant materials in the immediate surrounding area b preserve natural vegetation development shall be located so as to preserve to the maximum extent practical existing natural vegetation particularly mature vegetation which may help to screen its appearance c soil disturbance topsoil from a disturbed slope should be stockpiled onsite to the extent practical and should be used in revegetation of the subject property or surrounding area when this is feasible soils disturbed by development shall be retained onsite by using accepted erosion and sedimentation control practices d irrigation the applicant shall demonstrate that there are sufficient facilities for irrigation present on the property to support the vegetation that is proposed to be planted 4 building form and materials the following standards shall only apply to properties that are located in certain highly visible areas that are depicted on the hillside overlay map which is considered to be part of this mass the mass of the development shall be designed to minimize or reduce its overall visual impacts by complying with either of the following two 2 design approaches 1 breaking the mass into distinct smaller forms which may involve repeating similar forms at a more modest scale breaking facades and roof lines into smaller segments or stepping the building mass into the hillside when development is permitted to occur on a slope stepped foundation design and terraced building forms should also be used to allow buildings to step up or down with the natural slope  or 2 using simple building forms and simple roof lines that tend to reduce the visual perception of the structure b buildings shall meet the ground buildings shall be designed so they firmly meet the ground and do not use a pier design cantilevers may be permitted when 1 the town planner or other applicable final review body determines that using cantilevers causes less physical impacts on the slope and results in a building with less visual impacts than if cantilevers were not used  and 2 the resulting building form is compatible with that of surrounding structures c basement exposure no more than two 2 floors shall be exposed above grade an additional basement level is permitted and is determined to satisfy this requirement if it meets the following provisions 1 the additional basement level must be covered with grade at the exterior of the residence so that not more than six 6 feet of basement wall is exposed as measured vertically at all points around the perimeter of the residence except for any door or window and grading necessary to achieve the door or window that satisfies subsection 2 below 2 individual window openings that are no wider than six 6 feet may be approved by the town planner after a finding that the glazing is kept to a minimum and that such glazing is adequately screened from view from the public rightofway and the neighboring properties 3 any egress well may be no deeper than four 4 feet   bexh a 2012  exh a 2014 reserved adult entertainment uses

live and work in the same area the citizens of the town do not want basalt to become an exclusive community historically persons earning lower and median incomes have been able to attain housing in the basalt area and the town currently reflects a mix of socioeconomic backgrounds the town further recognizes that there is a growing gap between housing costs and wages in basalt therefore the town council has determined that it needs to develop and maintain an community housing program b the intent of this community housing program is to require new development to mitigate for a portion of the employees generated by such development and to reflect and maintain the towns small town character and enhance the livability of the town the goal of these regulations is to require new development to provide community housing attainable by persons having lower and median incomes paying not more than approximately thirty percent 30% of their household income for total housing expense 1 all new residential developments will integrate community housing into the development or if integration is impractical or not desired given the specific circumstance as determined at the sole discretion of the town provide meaningful community housing in or near the town  methods will be developed to maintain the affordability of existing housing in the town  nonresidential projects will mitigate for impacts they create by providing community housing  and existing community housing will not be lost or demolition 2 community housing should be dispersed throughout the community and where possible integrated into the existing community fabric 3 the town encourages community participation in solving and benefitting from solutions to the community housing concerns the town intends to supplement the provisions of this developing a program that looks at the total benefits to a neighborhood and to the community while relying less on numerical standards and limitations 4 the town will emphasize programs that will result in the creation of community housing units  by units being constructed or by existing units being permanently restricted for community housing either restrictions or other methods as an example the town has identified as a priority an accessory dwellingemployee dwelling unit program this will include an educational program on the benefits and workings of the accessory dwellingemployee dwelling unit program 5 community housing will be transit friendly integrate with intermodal transportation connections and perpetuate the towns history of pedestrian walkability and ease of mass transit use 6 the town will look at the total costs for all housing including life cycle costs such as painting building materials and energy costs the town will work toward a zero energy footprint for all housing 7 the towns housing program should acknowledge regional issues and encourage coordination among jurisdictions including community housing standards and requirements the town will seek out partnerships with other entities supporting community housing and develop reciprocal agreements the town will discourage jurisdiction shopping for development proposals 8 the town will

residential inclusionary requirements or 2 the commercial linkage requirements established in town a commercial linkage shall apply at the lowest applicable amiaffordability levels by way of example if a mixeduse project of one hundred thousand 100000 net square feet of total residential development and fifty thousand 50000 net square feet of commercial development were proposed the community housing obligation would be thirtyfive thousand 35000 square feet at an average price point affordable to a household earning eighty percent 80% ami this represents the higher net square footage requirement of inclusionary housing thirtyfive thousand 35000 or commercial mitigation twentyone thousand nine hundred thirtyfive 21935 at the eighty percent 80% ami level required by commercial mitigation c community housing units within a development constructed to satisfy commercial linkage requirements shall have an average initial sales price not to exceed a sales price that is affordable to individuals or households making eighty percent 80% of basalts ami as is updated periodically pursuant to the method established in the community housing guidelines by way of example if

households making eighty percent 80% of ami the second community housing unit could be priced to be affordable to individuals or households making one hundred percent 100% of ami and the third community housing unit could be priced to be affordable for those individuals or households making sixty percent 60% of ami so that they do not average an initial sales price greater than would be affordable to those individuals or households making eighty percent 80% of ami the bedroom mix of units used to meet the commercial linkage requirements shall be at the discretion of the town council as is set forth in mitigation methods d the community housing demand generated by a commercial development shall be determined by utilizing an average job generation rate of four 4 employees per one thousand 1000 net square feet of commercial space with adjustments for multiple job holding and multiple employees per household job generation rates and mitigation rates are based on the 20142015 town of basalt housing needs assessment the mitigation requirements shall be discounted by taking into account multiple job holdings of 124 jobs per employee and multiple employees per household of 143 employees per household as is demonstrated in the example below by way of example below is the housing demand requirement for a new three thousand 3000 net square foot of commercial space three thousand 3000 of net leasable square feet divided by one thousand 1000  multiplied by a job generation rate of four 4 fulltime employees per one thousand 1000 net square feet of commercial space  divided by 124 jobs per employees divided by 143 employees per household  multiplied by 15 fifteen percent 15% of employees generated mitigation requirement equals 101 community housing units required multiplied by nine hundred fifty 950 net square feet per community housing unit equals nine hundred fiftynine 959 net square feet of community housing required e if the applicant can document to the trcs reasonable satisfaction that the proposed commercial development will generate fewer jobs per one thousand 1000 net square feet than the rate of jobs identified above for the life of the project then the town may allow the applicant to use the anticipated lower jobgeneration rate in calculating commercial mitigation obligations the trc may require a request to use a lower job generation rate to be reviewed by the town council or an applicant may appeal the trcs determination to the town council the bedroom mix of units used to meet the commercial linkage requirements shall be at the

shall be submitted by the owner to the town planning department cchcs are issued to reflect credits based upon net square footage and are not to be based upon unit count cchcs may only be issued for the net square footage in the units developed in excess of any applicable housing mitigation requirements the term net square footage as used herein means the interior calculation of the actual square footage of a project and shall not include common circulation space or floor area located outside of the actual applicable dwelling units the cchc shall contain the following information a a number of

indicated color rendering index cri is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce the colors of various objects faithfully in comparison with an ideal or natural light source correlated color temperature cct means the color temperature of a light source is determined by comparing its chromaticity with that of an ideal blackbody radiator the temperature usually measured in kelvin k at which the heated blackbody radiator matches the color of the light source is that sources color temperature yellowred colors are considered warm and bluegreen colors are considered cool fixture height means the vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the fixture to the lowest direct light emitting part of the fixture fluorescent lamp or fluorescent tube is a gasdischarge lamp that uses electricity to excite mercury vapor the excited mercury atoms produce shortwave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor to fluoresce producing visible light footcandles means the illuminance on a one squarefoot surface of which there is a uniformly distributed flux of one lumen for the purposes of these regulations footcandles shall be measured at finished grade fully shielded light means light fixtures shielded or constructed so that no light rays are directly emitted by the installed fixture at angles above the horizontal plane as certified by a photometric test report the fixture must also be properly installed to effectively down direct light in order to conform with the definition exemptions from this definition may be allowed for aesthetic lighting elements such as shades with perforated patterns and opaque diffusers glare means excessive contrast or intense andor blinding light which creates visual discomfort or disability high intensity discharge light source hid means light sources characterized by an arc tube or discharge capsule that produces light with typical sources being metal halide high pressure sodium and other similar types which are developed in accordance with accepted industry standards incandescent andor halogen light source is the emission of light visible electromagnetic radiation from a hot body due to its temperature incandescence occurs in incandescent light bulbs because the filament resists the flow of electrons this resistance heats the filament to a temperature where part of the radiation falls in the visible spectrum landscape lighting means luminaires mounted in or at grade but not more than three 3 feet above grade and used solely for landscape rather than area lighting lightemitting diode led is a semiconductor diode that emits light when an electric current is applied in the forward direction of the device as in the simple led circuit the effect is a form of electroluminescence where incoherent and narrowspectrum light is emitted light fixture is an electrical device used to create artificial light or illumination a luminaire is a lighting fixture complete with the light source or lamp the reflector for directing the light an aperture with or without a lens the outer shell or housing for lamp alignment and protection an electrical ballast if required and connection to a power source light trespass means light escaping the boundaries of the property in excess of 02 footcandles lumen is the unit of measure used to quantify the amount of light produced by a lamp or emitted from a luminaire technically if a light source emits one 1 candela of luminous intensity uniformly across a solid angle of one 1 steradian its total luminous flux emitted into that angle is one 1 lumen alternatively an isotropic onecandela light source emits a total luminous flux of exactly 4tt lumens luminaire means a complete lighting unit consisting of one 1

community priorities scoring system is a tool that is intended to allow the town to manage the development applications it receives the scoring system provides a method by which the town can objectively evaluate development applications to determine which projects most directly respond to the goals objectives and recommendations that are set forth in the 2007 basalt master plan specifically the scoring system implements the following objectives from the 2007 basalt master plan 1 control growth establish measures to control growth and reduce the rate of growth to a rate less than the 48% annual rate of population growth the town has recently experienced  2 quality growth promote and support projects that provide quality growth which are consistent with the goals objectives and policies contained in the master plan do not create a financial burden on the community and provide significant benefits to the community  3 balance determine the appropriate balance between residential and commercial development and establish policies to achieve this balance  4 community housing preserve existing resident housing and explore a wide range of strategies to produce community housing for local residents  5 environmental sensitivity establish environmentally sensitive building and development standards  6 historic landmarks encourage landmark designation of additional structures by property owners and consider developing additional policies for the preservation of historic structures and places  and 7 gathering places retain and enhance significant existing community gathering places b overview of scoring system the community priorities scoring system establishes scoring standards that reflect adopted community priorities and a growth rate that limits the pace of development in the community certain types of projects must be ranked under the scoring standards and certain projects are also subject to the growth rate limitations table 1 below provides an overview of how the community priorities scoring system applies to different types of projects 1 exempt from scoring the types of projects that are exempt from the scoring system and do not need to receive an eligible score are classified with a no in the first column of table 1 refer to of this a description of these project types 2 subject to scoring the types of projects that are required to submit an application under the scoring system and must receive an eligible score are classified with a yes in the first column of table 1 refer to of this a description of these project types and to paragraph 164844 for an explanation of the meaning of the term eligible score 3 require a growth allotment the types of projects that are required to obtain a growth allotment are

experienced by the town after the initial adoption of the community priorities scoring system the scoring system will not apply to any land use applications until the town council holds a growth management notice public hearing and votes to approve a resolution reinitiating the full cpss process a growth management notice may be initiated in one 1 of two 2 ways the town council may vote at any time to hold a growth management notice public hearing  or alternatively the town planner may schedule a growth management public notice after at least one 1 of the following has occurred 1 three 3 consecutive years in which the annual growth rate exceeds an average of 48 percent based on building permit activity  or 2 more than one hundred fifty 150 units receive building permits in any one 1 year  or 3 the town approves more than two hundred fifty 250 dwelling units after approval of the ordinance the growth management public hearing notice will be published at least fifteen 15 days before the meeting a land use application which is not complete upon the date the growth management public hearing notice is presented to the town council will be subject to the scoring system unless the town council fails to officially reactivate the scoring system by resolution within three 3 months of the growth management public hearing notice the town council must adopt a resolution in order to reactivate the scoring system and establish the dates for review of the scoring system which can occur any time after the planning directors presentation of the growth management notice the reactivation resolution will establish the submission and processing dates for the first round of land use applications subject to the scoring system which may differ from those established in scoring system review procedures until the scoring system is reactivated by the council the town planner will score applications that otherwise would be subject to the scoring system during the standard development review process for evaluation by the planning and zoning commission and town council the planning and zoning commission and the town council will review this information to 1 evaluate whether absent the scoring system the town is getting projects that support the goals objectives and recommendations set forth in the thencurrent master plan  2 determine what changes if any would be appropriate to the scoring system 3 assist in evaluating whether the project is consistent with the thencurrent master plan since the scoring system was developed as an objective method of determining which projects most directly respond to the goals objectives and recommendations of the master plan applicants are therefore encouraged to develop projects that satisfy the scoring system standards established in this article and to provide information that assists the town in its evaluation of any future changes applicants are required to provide responses to the scoring system review standards as described in as part of their application for development b once reactivated as described in subsection a above the community priorities scoring system applies to the following types of development applications on lands within the incorporated limits of the town or that are proposed to be annexed to the town the development applications that qualify for an exemption from the scoring system are listed in of this 1 new residential lots and units any land use application that proposes to create four 4 or more new free market residential units or residential lots including the residential

development applications it receives by comparing the applications to one another to determine which most directly respond to the towns adopted growth priorities and contribute to the implementation of the master plan applications are accepted and reviewed twice per year and allotments are awarded to successful applicants twice per year b to assist applicants and members of the public in understanding how the scoring system functions the town has prepared a flow chart see figure 1 below that illustrates the steps in the scoring system following is an explanation of each of these steps figure 1 scoring system review process 1 preapplication conference before an applicant submits an application under the scoring system the applicant shall hold a preapplication conference with the town planner the purpose of the preapplication conference is for the applicant and the staff to review the proposed project so the applicant may become informed of how the review procedures and review standards of the scoring system will be applied to the proposal the town planner may issue an informal written summary of the preapplication conference if requested to do so by the applicant but shall only share the results of the conference with the applicant and not with other potential applicants so as to maintain a fair competition process 2 prepare and submit application a submission deadlines applications for a project to be scored shall be accepted on or before march 1 hereinafter the first session and september 1 hereinafter the second session of each year when the submission date falls on a weekend or official holiday the applications shall be due on the first business day after the weekend or holiday b initial land use application an application for project scoring shall be the initial land use application submitted for a property this shall mean that an application for project scoring shall be submitted prior to the submission of a sketch plan application a special review application or other land use application for properties that are located outside of the town limits the application for project scoring may be submitted subsequent to submission of an annexation petition obtaining an eligible score and allotments if necessary is a prerequisite to consideration by the town of any other application required by the does not create a vested right to any such approval c number of applications no more than one 1 application for project scoring may be submitted at a time for any property d submission contents the application shall include the following items 1 the towns development application form 2 if the applicant has a representative a letter shall be submitted signed by the applicant providing authorization for the representative to submit the application and to appear on behalf of the applicant 3 if the applicant is not the owner of the property a letter shall be submitted signed by the property owner providing authorization for the applicant to submit the application 4 a vicinity map drawn to scale showing the location and boundaries of the property in relation to the town limits the town street system and significant natural features 5 a brief written description of the existing conditions on the property and adjacent lands a survey or other map drawn to scale shall be provided depicting the existing conditions 6 a brief written summary of the proposed development with accompanying maps and other graphics that depict the proposed development the maps shall show all proposed buildings streets open spaces and other significant features and shall reflect the development proposed for the entire property 7 responses to the scoring system review standards as described in of this the processing fee for the application as determined by the town planner pursuant to a schedule of fees approved by the town pursuant to et seq of this commitments are binding commitments made by the applicant to obtain an allotment or an exemption from the scoring system are binding upon the applicant the subsequent land use applications submitted by the applicant shall demonstrate precisely how commitments made to obtain a score or an exemption will be implemented 1 failure of an applicant to implement and demonstrate compliance with any such commitments shall require a determination to be made of whether that failure constitutes a major amendment to the application pursuant to subparagraph 8a of this would require reconsideration of the application pursuant to the scoring system however a commitment made by an applicant that is eliminated from the project because of a direction to do so by the towns review bodies shall not be considered to be a major amendment to the application 2 if a project loses its allotments as a result of a failure to implement and demonstrate compliance with a commitment the town planner may determine that the project has also lost its standing in the land use application process and must restart the process with a new initial application the town planner shall consider the applicable provisions of this respect to minor and substantial amendments to an application in making this determination 3 staff review and recommendation a staff review for completeness within fifteen 15 days of the semiannual submission deadline the staff shall review the applications and determine whether each application is complete if the staff determines that an application is incomplete it shall be returned to the applicant and shall not be eligible for resubmission until the subsequent submission deadline b technical review committee the staff will refer the application to members of the technical review committee staff will assemble the comments of the technical review committee review and evaluate each application pursuant to the scoring standards in of this compile a recommended score for each application 4 planning and zoning commission scoring of applications a planning and zoning commission consideration the planning and zoning commission shall consider the recommended scoring of each complete application the planning and zoning commission shall make a goodfaith effort to act on the application within sixty 60 days after the deadline for submission of applications b scoring procedures each member of the planning and zoning commission in attendance at the meeting shall assign scores to each application considering the staff recommendations information submitted by the applicant and comments by the public applications shall not be scored in comparison to one another but rather shall be scored based on the degree to which each application complies with the scoring standards in below scores awarded shall take into account the plans for the entire property scores shall be awarded in whole numbers only c proportionality when scoring an application the planning and zoning commission should consider whether the commitments being made by the applicant are proportional to the size of the allotment being requested in other words an applicant seeking a large number of allotments would be expected to make a proportionally greater commitment to obtain a score in any category as compared to an applicant seeking a lesser number of allotments d ranking of projects at the conclusion of the scoring the staff shall tally the scores awarded by each commission member divide the total of all scores awarded to each project by the number of members scoring and announce the average score for each application once the average scores have been announced the planning and zoning commission shall rank the projects in the order of the score awarded 1 if there is a tie score among two 2 or more projects then the tie shall be broken by giving the higher rank to the project that scored the greater number of points in the community housing scoring categories if there is still a tie then it shall be broken by giving the higher rank to the project that scored the greater number of points in the community facilities scoring categories and then if the tie is still not broken to the project that scored the greater total number of points in the environmental quality scoring categories 2 the planning and zoning commission shall also identify which projects have received an eligible score and which have received a score that is below the eligible threshold residential projects must be awarded a minimum score of twenty 20 points to meet the eligibility threshold commercial projects must be awarded a minimum score of fifteen 15 points to meet the eligibility threshold 3 once the ranking is established the planning and zoning commission shall forward the scores to the town council 5 town council final ranking of projects the town council shall consider the scores awarded by the planning and zoning commission the town council shall make a goodfaith effort to consider the scores at a meeting held no more than thirty 30 days after the scores were forwarded the town council shall accept the scores as recommended unless an applicant has submitted an appeal of the scoring or the town council calls up one 1 or more of the scores a appeal an applicant who is aggrieved by a score awarded to his or her project may submit an appeal of the score the appeal shall be submitted in writing to the town planner within ten 10 days after the scores have been forwarded 1 the appeal shall be decided by the town council based solely upon the record established at the planning and zoning commission hearing an appeal shall not be

in the 2009 housing needs assessment which is less than the 48% annual rate of growth the town had experienced prior to the adoption of the 2007 master plan the two percent allotment rate has been adopted in recognition of the fact that the new community housing units new units built in previously approved developments and pipeline projects are not subject to the annual allotment limit but will contribute to the towns annual rate of population growth so they must be accounted for in setting the number of new allotments that will be available on an annual basis b allotments for other types of

subdivisions while it may not be possible to follow these guidelines in every instance every subdivision should be based on these fundamental site planning principles that can result in lower energy costs 1 take advantage of southfacing slopes for solar orientation especially for higher density development 2 lot layouts should emphasize northsouth orientation as much as possible 3 street layout and design of singlefamily subdivisions should have an eastwest orientation as much as possible within the limits of the topography to assure proper orientation of buildings 4 generally face on these eastwest streets 5 if northsouth orientation of streets is necessary then the lots or buildings should be planned to maximize southern solar access 6 lot lines should extend from north to south even if streets are necessarily designed intercardinally 7 special consideration should be given to the potential shadows created on a lot by building development and by landscaping 8 subdivision covenants should encourage building development close to the north property line therefore allowing greater area to the south for solar access  secs 17441760  reserved article iii  application requirements

intersection triangle appendix b basalt town road specifications town road specifications the board of trustees having discussed this subject matter and having made a motion to adopt and approve this document the town road specifications the policy of the board of trustees is set forth herein under the heading of town road specifications and can be found in the appendix of the basalt municipal road regulations 1 general  purpose the following regulations are the criteria which shall govern the application for construction design and construction of roadways to be dedicated to the town of basalt and construction within any rightofway for existing and proposed city roads 2 definitions a administration  the town of basalt town administrator or his qualified agent administers the town road system including but not limited to maintenance layout alterations deletions additions property acquisition and traffic regulation town jurisdiction extends to all roads other than state or federal highways within incorporated lands of the town of basalt b planning commission  in regard to the town road system the basalt planning commission acts as an advisory board to the board of trustees in matters of route and circulation planning and development standards and shall conduct public hearings on the same c town transportation plan  at such time that a town transportation plan is adopted by the board of trustees it shall be the plans purpose to protect rightsofway for future road development and anticipate expansion additions and alterations to the town road system d town road types  all town roads are divided into the following 5 types for planning purposes 1 type 1  freeways and expressways  a freeway is a divided multilane arterial for with full control of access and all grade crossings eliminated an expressway is a divided multilane arterial for with controlled access and with some crossings at grade 2 type 2  arterials  an arterial is a continuous access controlled road for with crossings at grade points of access are limited some existing crossings may not be at grade 3 type 3  collectors  a collector is a vicinitywide continuous access road connecting local access roads to arterials 4 type 4  local access roads  a local access road provides direct access from abutting properties to other roads 5 type 5  frontage roads  a frontage road serves as a collector or local access road used contiguous to higher type roads to control access 3 town road development new roads are added to the town roads system by resolutions passed by the board of trustees sources of new roads are annexations realignments abandoned state or county highways subdivisions and other developments the addition of roads to the town road system involving special cases may be considered on an individual basis ordinarily before a new road becomes a part of the town road system it passes steps planning design rightofway acquisition or dedication construction inspection and acceptance a planning criteria  prior to the design of a new road the road type the terrain classification and the design speed must be determined the road types are defined in the road type must be selected to conform to the standards of the town planning commission and is subject to the approval of the town administrator 1 terrain classification  for the purpose of this regulation the terrain in basalt is divided into three categories a flat or rolling   average cross slope less than 15% and the ridges and draws are not welldefined b mountainous   average cross slope greater than 15% and the ridges and draws are steep and welldefined c residual areas  conforms to current planning commission requirements 2 design speed design speed is a speed selected to correlate design of those physical elements of road that influence vehicle operation the choice of design speed is influenced primarily by the terrain classification road type construction and cost of the road terrain road type classification 1 2 3 4  5 flat or rolling 5565 5055 4050 3040 mountainous 5565 5055 3040 2030 residential 2535 1525 b design standards  1 road patterns and horizontal alignment  the streets and roads shall bear a logical relationship to topography and location of existing or probable future roads in adjacent tracts of land in mountainous terrain it may be preferable to provide wider standard alignment for the rightofway than for the road itself the roadbed will then be permitted to wind around within the rightofway to reduce cuts and unnecessary scarring provided that minimum standards are met the wider standard rightofway will permit improvement of the alignment as traffic warrants roads should not be located too close when parallel to streams and rivers subject to flooding there should be a vegetated strip to trap soil carried by runoff between the toe of the fill and the thread line of the water channel where developable but unplatted land is separated from an existing public rightofway by a proposed subdivision the proposed subdivision shall provide roads extending to the boundary common to both tracts to prevent land locking of the unplatted tract these access roads shall be coordinated with and provided at no cost to the unplatted land owner these points of access shall also conform to the latest circulation plan prepared by the basalt planning staff dead end roads permanent or temporary shall not be more than 500 feet in length unless specific approval is given by the planning commission and the town board of trustees these dead end roads shall be provided with culdesacs with a minimum diameter of 90 feet measured from outside shoulder of the road bed the minimum paved diameter is 60 feet adequate snow

or point of curvature on a switchback e vertical curves  grade changes shall be accomplished by vertical curves of sufficient length to maintain safe sight distances minimum lengths for vertical curves shall be 400 feet for design speeds above 30 mph and 200 feet for design speeds 30 mph and below special cases may be considered by the town administrator 3 horizontal and vertical alignment must provide at least the minimum stopping sight distance for the design speed at all points this includes visibility at intersections as well as around curves and roadside encroachments the required stopping sight distance for a given design speed on dry pavement is as follows design speed mph stopping sight distance feet 15 100 20 150 25 175 30 200 35 250 40 275 50 350 55 400 the required

radius feet 15 60 20 100 25 175 30 250 35 375 40 550 50 850 sight distance and minimum radii for speeds over 50 mph shall use colorado state highway design criteria in locations where switchbacks may be required the circular curve radius of the roadbed may be a minimum of 50 feet every effort should be made to exceed the minimum values sudden reductions in designed radii introduce the element of surprise to the driver and should be avoided where physical restrictions cannot be overcome and it becomes necessary to introduce curvature of lower standard than the design speed for the project the design speed between successive curves shall not change by more than 20 miles per hour increments under no conditions shall a curve for a design speed lower than the design speed of the project be introduced at the end of a long tangent or at other locations where high approach speeds may be anticipated reversing curves without an intervening tangent will not be permitted where reverse curves are needed the following minimum tangent lengths shall be provided for road types 3 4 and 5 design speed tangent 15 50 20 75 25 100 30 150 35 200 40 and above 250 for road types 1 and 2 minimum

coordination  wherever possible vertical curves should be superimposed on horizontal curves to reduce the number of sight distance restrictions for safety reasons the horizontal curve should overlap the vertical curve a sharp horizontal curve should not be introduced at or near a pronounced summit or grade sag this is particularly hazardous at night horizontal and vertical curvature at intersections should be as flat as physical conditions permit in mountainous terrain undulating grades are preferable to long sustained grades in order to reduce cuts and fills reduce scarring of vegetative cover and avoid accumulation of erosive drainage in long sustained roadside ditches 5 geometric cross  typical the town planning commission and the board of trustees must approve the developers street classifications prior to final road design in areas of steep slopes the rightofway width may of necessity be wider than that shown below in order that the minimum road bed width may
