public welfare by guiding regulating and controlling the design construction use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situated in the village it is the intention of this chapter that the delivery of sediment from sites affected by land disturbing activities be limited as closely as practicable to that which would have occurred if the land had been left in its natural undisturbed state the village board hereby finds that a excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain nonagricultural uses including but not limited to the construction of dwelling units commercial buildings and industrial plants the building of roads and highways the modification of stream channels and drainageways and the creation of recreational facilities  b the washing blowing and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles  c soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies washed out fills and embankments  d sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers streams lakes wetlands and reservoirs  e sediment promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life and is costly and difficult to remove  and f sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways and the storage capacity of floodplains and natural depressions resulting in increased chances of flooding and risk to public health and safety  1133 authority authority for the administration of these regulations shall be vested in the planning commission and the village

activities including clearing grading stripping excavating and filling of land in the village measures taken to control soil erosion and off site sediment runoff should be adequate to assure that sediment is not transported from site by a storm event of 10year frequency or less the following principles shall apply to all development activities within the village and to the preparation of the submissions required under section 1137 of this chapter a development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible b natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses lakes ponds and wetlands should be left undisturbed wherever possible temporary crossings of watercourses when permitted must include appropriate stabilization measures c special precautions should be taken to prevent damages resultant from any necessary development activity within or adjacent to any stream lake pond or wetland preventative measures should reflect the sensitivity of these areas to erosion and sedimentation d the smallest practical area of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development e sediment basins or traps filter barriers diversions and any other appropriate sediment or runoff control measures should be installed prior to site clearing and grading and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development f the selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion and on evaluation of the risks costs and benefits involved g in the design of erosion control facilities and practices aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered h provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities and rates of discharge will not create additional erosion on site or downstream i permanent vegetation and structures should be installed and functional as soon as practical during development  sterling codifiers inc  697714 j those areas being converted from agricultural purposes to other land uses should be vegetated with an appropriate protective cover prior to development k
