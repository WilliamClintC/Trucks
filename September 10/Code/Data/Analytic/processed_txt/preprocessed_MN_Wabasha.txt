created by some mining activities impact neighbors in particular residential in a negative manner 5the location and depth of a mine has the potential to impact underground water sources depended upon by the public for drinking water 6the methods and treatment of a mine site after the excavation process ends has a great impact on the ultimate use of the property and the impact of that site on neighboring properties and the community as a whole 7the mining of industrial aggregates is generally more intensive than construction aggregate mining in terms of its negative impact on the land and

criteria as established by the us environmental protection agency epa which are described in 40 cfr part 58 app e gfor horizontal and vertical placement of monitors based on a study submitted with the air quality plan to determine the criteria for placement of air monitoring probes or sample inlets in most cases air monitoring probes and inlets must be located between seven and 23 feet above ground level as a result monitoring sites located at ground level typically require the installation of an elevated platform or shelter air monitoring sites may also be located on the roof of a building which is no higher than two stories  hfor placement of monitors with spacing from emission sources for sourceoriented or hot spot monitoring air monitors should be located as close to the area of expected maximum air pollution concentration as safely possible  ispacing from obstructions buildings and other obstacles can impact air monitoring results by scavenging pollutants and restricting airflow to the monitor resulting in inaccurate air concentration measurements in general if an obstruction is located near an air monitoring site the distance of the air monitor from the obstruction must be twotimes the height of the obstruction  jthe monitoring of ambient air to compare air monitoring results with air quality standards the air monitoring site must be measuring ambient air outside of the facilitys property line if a fence or other physical obstruction prevents public access if no such obstruction exists air quality monitors located within a facilitys property boundary

afindings purpose  scope 1findings the city council finds that as the population grows there will be an increased need for land that can be devoted to public recreational purposes to serve both the residents of new developments and existing residents of the city the city council also finds that much of the citys existing recreation infrastructure due to age and usage is in need of repair or replacement the city council further finds that parklands must compete for financial resources with other community needs and therefore may not be able to be adequately funded entirely from the present tax levy or that to do so may not be equitable to existing residents therefore subdividers may have to contribute funds for parklands 2purpose the purpose of parkland dedication is to provide a mechanism whereby the city is able to obtain for public use land that can be used for newly created parks recreational facilities playgrounds trails or open space  or a reasonable cash payment that can be used to acquire land or facilities for that purpose  as authorized by the provisions of ms   subd 2b as it may be amended from time to time 3scope the provisions of this subchapter shall apply

is of a size or configuration that dedication of a portion thereof 1is not feasible or practical  2will not create a parcel suitable for a park recreational facility playground trail or open space purposes  or 3is adjacent or readily accessible to an existing park recreational facility trail or open space facilities  the requirement of dedication of land imposed by division b above may be satisfied by a payment of cash by the subdivider to the city or a suitable provision in a development agreement between the subdivider and the city governing the development of the land in question the payment shall be made prior to the execution of the final plat by the appropriate city officials in an amount equivalent to the fair market value of the land which would otherwise be required to
