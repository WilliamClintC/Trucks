a nonconforming use or is used in association with a nonconforming use are regulated in 6 nonconforming structures and signs see group developments 1 definition a group development is any development containing either of the following a two or more buildings on the same lot with each building containing one or more principal land uses for any group development of this type all of the buildings on the lot must be developed for the same broad land use type such as residential land use institutional land use commercial land use storagedisposal land use transportation land use or industrial land use  or b any single structure on a single lot which contains 5 or more dwelling units  or c any single structure on a single lot which contains either 2 or more different types of institutional land uses as listed in 3 or 2 or more different types of commercial land uses as listed in 4 or 2 or more different types of storagedisposal land uses as listed in 5 or 2 or more different types of transportation land uses as listed in 6 or 2 or more different types of industrial land uses as listed in 7 common examples of group developments include 6unit apartment buildings apartment complexes condominium complexes a single building shopping center with different types of commercial land uses within the center and a multiplebuilding office center onebuilding office structures onebuilding indoor sales centers and a 4unit apartment building are not group developments mixing different types of land uses such as residential and commercial or commercial and industrial uses on the same lot is not allowed as a group development but may be allowed establishment of a unified development district 2 regulation of group developments group developments are allowed as a conditional use in all zoning districts any land use that is allowed as a permitted or conditional use within the applicable zoning district in which the group development is proposed to be located may be allowed to locate within the proposed group development if a group development is proposed to be located in more than one standard zoning district only those uses which are allowed within each particular zoning district may be considered for establishment in the respective portion of the proposed group development uses within each zoning district must conform to the allowable uses for the district the land use regulations of this as well as all other applicable provisions of this apply to the group development the requirements of apply to the review of proposals for group developments 3 specific development standards for group developments a all required offstreet parking spaces and access drives shall be located entirely within the boundaries of the group development b each individual land

circulation network used by customers c the development shall contain a sufficient number of waste bins to accommodate all trash and waste generated by the land uses in a convenient manner d no group development shall take access to a local residential street e all development located within a group development shall be located so as to comply with the intent of this setbacks of structures and buildings from lot lines as such individual principal and accessory structures and buildings located within group developments shall be situated within building envelopes which serve to demonstrate complete compliance with said intent said building envelopes shall be depicted on the site plan required for review of group developments the use of this approach to designing group developments will also ensure the facilitation of subdividing group developments in the future if such action is so desired 4 discrimination against condominium forms of ownership it is not the intent of this nor any other provision of this to discriminate against condominium forms of ownership in any manner which conflicts with 70327 wis stats as such the provisions of this designed to ensure that condominium forms of ownership are subject to the same standards and procedures of review and development as other physically identical forms of development minimum standards for singlefamily detached dwellings

in the vicinity 3 canopytentlike structures cr #200704 canopytentlike structures are specifically prohibited as not meeting the design standards of this section subchapter 17v  density and intensity regulations purpose the purpose of this subchapter is to indicate the maximum permitted density for residential projects and maximum permitted intensity for nonresidential projects of development on any given site the development potential of any site is determined by a variety of factors including but not limited to 1 the area of the site  2 the proportion of the site not containing sensitive natural resources  3 the zoning districts in which the site is located  4 the development options the site is developed under  and 5 the uses considered for development rationale this subchapter regulates the development potential of all property within the town this subchapter is designed to ensure the implementation of many goals and objectives of the town of rib mountain comprehensive master plan see also this  many of these are extremely difficult to address using conventional zoning techniques particularly those which rely on minimum lot area requirements to establish maximum permitted residential densities and maximum floor area ratios to establish the character of nonresidential developments such approaches provide for a minimum flexibility of site design options which in turn results in land use inefficiencies forced site planning andor the needless destruction of sensitive natural resources the approach employed by this subchapter relying on maximum gross densities mgds and minimum green space ratios gsrs for residential development and minimum required landscape surface ratios lsrs in combination with maximum permitted floor area ratios fars for nonresidential development both in conjunction with a variety of development options available in every zoning district results in a very high degree of site design flexibility and the protection and implementation of desired community character and adopted community goals and objectives how to use this subchapter this subchapter contains the standards which determine the maximum amount of development permitted on any given site prior to using the provisions of this subchapter to determine the development potential of a given property the guidelines provided by 1 3 should be reviewed this subchapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential land uses and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners the description of the process addressing residential development in 1 and 2 refers to the requirements of residential density standards the description of the process addressing nonresidential development in 1 and 3 refers to the requirements of nonresidential intensity standards required natural resources site evaluation 1 purpose an important goal of the town of rib mountain comprehensive master plan is the protection of natural resources which are sensitive to disruption caused by development andor other land use activities these resources include floodways floodway fringes floodplain conservancy areas wetlands drainageways lakeshores steep slopes and woodlands these resources are defined in subchapter 17vii these resources serve important functions which are lost when these areas are subject to development andor other land use activities in the absence of correct mitigation approaches in many instances these functions cannot be provided by other natural or manmade features specific broad categories of such functions include the protection and enhancement of air surface water ground water and soil quality  habitat provision and diversification  aesthetic diversification  and buffering effects 2 mitigation in certain instances natural features can accommodate development andor other land use activities without a significant loss of their functional benefits if proper mitigation practices are employed subchapter 17vii natural resource protection regulations provides detailed standards regarding permitted mitigation techniques and requirements 3 continues with the natural resources site

referred to for the selected development option in the identified zoning districts f check minimum site area requirement against the gross site area the required minimum site area msa given in residential density standards for the development option selected in e and in the zoning district identified in b should be compared with the gross site area gsa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in step c above if the gsa is less than the msa required by the selected development option then a different development option must be selected or additional property should be acquired g determine maximum gross density permitted on the site the maximum gross density mgd given in residential density standards for the development option selected in e and the zoning district identified in b above should be noted this number is used in step h below h determine the maximum number of units permitted on the site the maximum gross density mgd identified in g above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in step c above equals the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on the subject property under the selected development option within the selected zoning district the ability to actually develop this number of dwelling units on the subject property is not guaranteed by the provisions of this site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a lower number of units actually fitting on the site i check the minimum permitted lot area against table  the minimum lot area mla requirement given in residential density standards is the smallest size lot permitted within the selected development option within the selected zoning district the mla must equal or be less than the lot size requirement for the type of dwelling unit proposed for the project in step d above if the mla given in larger than the lot size requirement given in step d then a dwelling unit type with a larger lot size must be selected in which case it may be advantageous to repeat steps d i using a different dwelling unit type and a different development option 3 nonresidential development for steps a c see 1 above a key to assist with the procedure described below d determine what types of land uses are permitted the table of uses  should be checked to determine which types of land uses are permitted within the zoning district present on or proposed for the subject property a complete description of each land use is presented in e identify the desired development option number of floors nonresidential intensity standards presents a detailed listing of the development options available for nonresidential development in each zoning district each development option is based on a particular combination of maximum number of floors #f minimum landscape surface ratio lsr and maximum floor area ratio far the selection of a particular development option may be related to the presence of sensitive natural resource areas on the site or may reflect current or projected nonresidential market conditions and the types of buildings they call for f check minimum lot area requirement against gross site area present on the subject property the required minimum lot area mla given in nonresidential intensity standards for the development option selected in e and in the zoning district identified in b should be compared with the gross site area gsa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resources site evaluation in step c above if the gsa is less than the mla required by the selected development option then additional property should be acquired in other words the gsa from c must be greater than or equal to the mla from e g check minimum landscape surface ratio requirement against the required resource protection area present on the subject property the required landscape surface ratio lsr given in nonresidential intensity standards for the development option selected in c and in the zoning district identified in b should be multiplied by the gross site area gsa used in step f above the resulting product is the area of the site which must be permanently protected as green space this area should be compared with the required resource protection area rpa required on the subject property as determined under the natural resource site evaluation in step c above if the area of the site containing sensitive natural resources exceeds the area of permanently protected landscape surface required in the selected development option then a development option requiring more floors may have to be used in order to approach maximum development potential on the site in other words if the rpa from c is greater than the lsr from 5 a taller development option may permit the development of more floor area on the subject property h determine maximum floor area ratio permitted on the site the maximum floor area ratio far given in nonresidential intensity standards for the development option selected in e and the zoning district identified in b above should be noted this number will be used in step i below i determine the maximum floor area permitted on the site the maximum floor area ratio far identified in h above multiplied by the gross site area gsa calculated in step c above equals the maximum square footage of gross floor area permitted on the subject property under that development option within that zoning district the ability to actually develop this amount of floor area is not guaranteed by the provisions of this site design poor property configuration and other factors may result in a smaller amount of area actually fitting on the site j check the maximum building size requirement nc district the maximum building size mbs requirement given in nonresidential intensity standards is the largest size building permitted within the selected development option within the neighborhood commercial nc district the mbs must equal or be greater than the building size proposed for the project in step i above if the mbs given in smaller than the proposed building size calculated in step i above then a smaller building must be built or the use of additional buildings should be considered rationale each nonresidential zoning district permits a slight variation in maximum floor area ratio far depending upon the type of development option used as the minimum required landscape surface ratio lsr increases within each zoning district based on the development option selected the far increases this intensity incentive is based on 2 principles first the combinations of far and lsr requirements for the various development options within each zoning district are designed to result in a consistent community character of development within that district  second the intensity incentive is designed to compensate for potential per square foot price reductions associated with smaller fars in developments providing significant amounts of required green space the minimum lot area mla requirements for each development option within each zoning district are used to ensure that a consistency of neighborhood character within each development option is maintained and that maximum permitted floor area ratios fars are approachable if not completely attainable under efficient site design practices finally the maximum building size mbs requirements ensure that development within the neighborhood commercial nc district retains a neighborhood function and maintains a scale which is compatible with nearby residential development subchapter 17vi  bulk regulations purpose the purpose of this subchapter is to indicate the requirements for building location and bulk in both residential and nonresidential developments the provisions of this subchapter interact closely with the provisions of subchapter 17v density and intensity regulations how to use this subchapter this subchapter contains the standards which determine the location and height of buildings on any given site prior to using the provisions of this subchapter to determine the potential layout of a given project the recommendations provided below should be reviewed this subchapter recognizes inherent differences between residential and nonresidential projects and thus regulates their development in slightly different manners the description of the process addressing residential property in subsections 1 and 2 below refers to the requirements of residential bulk standards the description of the process addressing nonresidential property in subsections 1 and 3 below refers to the requirements of nonresidential bulk standards 1 for both residential and nonresidential development a identify the zoning district and development option to govern development of the subject property for buildable lots the official zoning map should be consulted to determine the zoning of the subject property for proposed developments the operations required in subchapter 17v should be performed in order to identify the applicable zoning district and development option a detailed stepbystep description of the recommended procedure for determining the applicable zoning district and development option b note the identified zoning district and development option applicable to the subject property the applicable zoning district and development option identified for the subject property per a above should be noted the development option for residential development determines the minimum lot area mla permitted within the development this is the key item of information for determining residential bulk regulations the development option for nonresidential development determines the maximum number of floors #f permitted within the development this is the key item of information for determining nonresidential bulk regulations 2 for residential development for steps a and b see 1 above c determine

of groundwater from a wetland to another area or the flow of groundwater wetland c filtering or storage of sediments nutrients heavy metals or organic compounds that would otherwise drain into navigable waters d fish spawning breeding nursery or feeding grounds e wildlife habitat and wildlife f areas of special recreational scenic or scientific interest including scarce wetland types 5 setbacks setback for any structure not specifically permitted above shall be 10 feet from the edge of the delineated wetlands lakeshore overlay district 1 definition lakeshores are the land margins of navigable waters as defined by state of wisconsin statutes lakeshores are all areas within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of such features decorative water features shall not be considered navigable waters for the purposes of this meaning of lakeshores shall remain distinct from the meaning of the term as employed by the state of wisconsin statutes and the dnr 2 purpose of lakeshore protection requirements lakeshores serve to protect landwater margins from erosion due to site disruption because of regular contact with wave action currents and runoff such areas are highly susceptible to continuous and in some cases rapid erosion lakeshore protection also provides a natural vegetation buffer which serves to reduce water velocities and wave energy and filters significant amounts of waterborne pollutants and sediments lakeshores also promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin 3 determination of lakeshore boundaries general lakeshore boundaries are depicted on usgs topographic maps covering the town upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a lakeshore depicted on said maps the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of analysis shall depict the location of all lakeshore areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of 1 above 4 mandatory lakeshore protection requirements lakeshores shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in the requirements of 10 all marathon county regulations pertaining to shorelands shall be applicable as administered by the county zoning department drainageway overlay district 1 definition drainageways are nonnavigable aboveground watercourses detention basins andor their environs which are identified by the presence of one or more of the following a all areas within 75 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a perennial stream as shown on usgs maps covering the town of rib mountain  b all areas within 50 feet of the ordinary high water mark of an intermittent stream or open channel drainageway as shown on usgs maps covering the town of rib mountain 2 purpose of drainageway protection requirements drainageways serve in the transporting of surface runoff to downstream areas as such drainageways serve to carry surface waters supplement floodplain wetland and lakeshore water storage functions in heavy storm or melt events filter waterborne pollutants and sediments promote infiltration and groundwater recharging and provide a unique habitat at the landwater margin drainageway protection requirements preserve each of these functions as well as greatly reducing the potential for soil erosion along drainageways by protecting vegetative groundcover in areas which are susceptible to variable runoff flows and moderate to rapid water movement 3 determination of drainageway boundaries general drainageway boundaries are depicted on usgs topographic maps covering the town of rib mountain upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a drainageway the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of analysis shall depict the location of all drainageway areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of 1 above 4 mandatory drainageway protection requirements drainageways shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in the requirements in 10 vegetation clearing to maintain drainageway functions is permitted with the written approval of the town engineer all areas designated as drainageways shall be located within a public easement or dedication for maintenance purposes to preserve proper drainage flow woodland overlay district 1 definition woodlands are areas of trees whose combined canopies cover a minimum of 80% of an area of one acre or more as shown on the most recent air photos covering the town of rib mountain 2 purpose of woodland protection requirements woodlands provide a wide variety of environmental functions these include atmospheric benefits such as removing airborne pollutants carbon dioxide uptake oxygen production and evapotranspiration returns water quality benefits include substantial nutrient uptake rates particularly for nitrogen and phosphorus and surface runoff reduction in terms of both volumes and velocities woodlands provide unique wildlife habitats and food sources woodlands are excellent soil stabilizers greatly reducing runoffrelated soil erosion woodlands also serve to reduce wind velocities which further reduces soil erosion finally under proper management techniques woodlands serve as regenerative fuel sources 3 determination of woodland boundaries general woodland boundaries are depicted on the most recent air photos covering the town of rib mountain upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a woodland the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of analysis shall depict the location of all woodland areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of 1 above 4 mandatory woodland protection requirements woodlands shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in the requirements of 10 and areas subject to the following mitigation requirements selective cutting operations are permitted as a special use in all woodland areas per the requirements of 2f clear cutting is permitted as a conditional use in all woodland areas per the requirements of 2g steep slope overlay zoning district 1 definition steep slopes are areas which contain a gradient of 12% or greater equivalent to a 10foot elevation change in a distance of 83 feet or less as shown on usgs topographic maps or more detailed site specific topographic information covering the town of rib mountain 2 purpose of steep slope protection requirements steep slopes are particularly susceptible to damage resulting from site disruption primarily related to soil erosion such damage is likely to spread to areas which were not originally disturbed such erosion reduces the productivity of the soil results in exacerbated erosion downhill and results in increased sedimentation in drainageways wetlands streams ponds and lakes beyond adversely effecting the environmental functions of these resources areas such sedimentation also increases flood hazards by reducing the flood water storage capacity of hydrological system components thus elevating the flood level of the drainage system in effected areas beyond these threats to the public safety disruption of steep slopes also increases the likelihood of slippage and slumpingunstable soil movements which may threaten adjacent properties buildings and public facilities such as roads and utilities 3 determination of steep slope boundaries general steep slope boundaries are depicted on usgs topographic maps or more detailed site specific topographic information covering the town of rib mountain upon the proposal of development activity on any property which contains a steep slope the petitioner shall prepare a detailed site analysis per the requirements of analysis shall depict the location of all steep slope areas on the subject property as related to the provisions of 1 above 4 mandatory steep slope protection requirements steep slopes shall remain in an undisturbed state except for the land uses permitted in the requirements of 10 detailed site analysis 1 purpose the detailed site analysis required by this subchapter is designed to provide the clear identification of permanently protected green space areas on a site which is proposed for development the detailed survey work required to identify these areas accurately on a map is not required prior to the initiation of development plans for an area a detailed site analysis shall be performed in conjunction with required land division documents or development site plans see  for any and all properties containing permanently protected natural resource areas 2 description the detailed site analysis shall be shown on a map of the subject property which depicts the location of all protected natural resource areas as defined by the provisions of this subchapter and as located by an onsite survey the detailed site analysis shall meet the following requirements a scale a minimum scale of one inch equals 200 feet shall be used b topography topographic information is not required for any property which does not contain steep slopes as designated on usgs topographic maps covering the town in excess of 12% for such properties topographic information with a minimum contour interval of 2 feet is required c specific natural resources areas all natural resource areas which require protection under the provisions of this be accurately outlined and clearly labeled particular care as to clarity shall be taken in areas where different resource types overlap with one another d development pads 1 all site disruption including selective cutting proposed to occur within permanently protected natural resource areas shall be limited to development pads development pads shall be depicted on the detailed site analysis map site plans required for development permits and the recorded plat of subdivision or certified survey map 2 beyond visible damage to natural resources vegetation soil and drainage patterns site disruption activities shall not compact soil covering tree roots or otherwise damage trees beyond the area from which trees are to be removed all trees with calipers exceeding 3 inches whose canopies are located adjacent to disturbed areas which die within a period of 5 years following site disruption shall be replaced by the property owner with a 3inch caliper tree of the same type canopy or understory therefore care shall be taken to ensure that equipment and actions associated with permitted site disruption activities are limited to the area in which they are permitted the use of snow fences and other barriers to outline development pads during disruption activity is strongly recommended to limit the extent of inadvertent compaction or other disturbance of earth and collision damage to vegetation intended for protection such barriers should be placed no closer to protected trees than a point on the ground directly under their outer canopy edge  e mitigation areas all mitigation areas related to the provisions of this be depicted on the detailed site analysis map with notations provided which describe the mitigation techniques employed 3 required procedure for submission and review a required timing of submission the detailed site analysis

disruption mitigation standards result in the thorough and reasonably rapid replacement of the important and varied environmental functions which woodlands provide see  landscaping requirements for bufferyards 1 purpose this the landscaping and width requirements for bufferyards on lots developed after the effective date of this see  a bufferyard is a combination of distance and a visual buffer or barrier it includes an area together with the combination of plantings berms and fencing that are required to eliminate or reduce existing or potential nuisances these nuisances can often occur between adjacent zoning districts such nuisances are dirt litter noise glare of lights signs and incompatible land uses buildings or parking areas rationale one of zonings most important functions is the separation of land uses into districts which have similar character and contain compatible uses the location of districts is supposed to provide protection but in the town of rib mountain this is not the case since zoning districts permitting uses as diverse as singlefamily residential and industrial uses were located next to one another long before the effective date of this will operate to minimize the negative impact of any future use on neighboring uses 2 required locations for bufferyards bufferyards shall be located along and within the outer perimeter of a lot wherever 2 different zoning districts abut one another bufferyards may be located in required setback areas in such instances the onehalf of the bufferyard requirements of this be used instead of the street frontage landscaping required in if such requirements of this greater in such instances the width of the rightofway may be counted as contributing to the width requirements for a bufferyard however the minimum width required along the street frontage by be provided in all cases bufferyard plantings or structures shall not be located on any portion of any existing dedicated or officially mapped rightofway 3 determination of required bufferyard the determination of bufferyard requirements is a twostaged process first the required level of bufferyard opacity is determined using table 4a opacity is a quantitativelyderived measure which indicates the degree to which a particular bufferyard screens the adjoining property the required level of opacity indicated by this table is directly related to the degree to which the potential character of development differs between different zoning districts the provisions of this the minimum requirements for bufferyards located along zoning district boundaries a identification of required level of opacity table 4a shall be used to determine the minimum level of opacity for the required bufferyard the required level of opacity is determined by the value given in the cell of the table at which the column heading along the top row of the table representing the subject propertys zoning district intersects with the row heading along the left hand side of the table representing the adjacent propertys zoning district the value listed is the required level of opacity for the bufferyard on the subject property b identification of detailed bufferyard requirements 1 if a proposed use adjoins a parcel for which a bufferyard is required by the presence of a zoning district boundary that use shall provide a bufferyard with the level of the opacity indicated in table 4a 2 for each level of opacity listed in table 4a a wide variety of width landscaping point berm and structure combinations are possible these are listed in table 4b the requirements listed in table 4b pertain to the number of landscaping points the minimum bufferyard width and the type of berm or fencing required within every 100 feet of required bufferyard a variety of landscaping point options are available and may be mixed within distinct portions of the same bufferyard the various available landscaping point alternatives a listing of tree and shrub species which correspond the landscaping point descriptions 4 tables for required bufferyards see following pages for tables 4a and b notes for table 4a for properties zoned in the rural holding district

result from a proposed modified or existing land use to this end those called upon to interpret this proceed as follows a articulate certain public purposes underlying the standards for which an interpretation is required rationale before any zoning interpretation is made there must be an explicit discussion of certain purposes for which the regulation was initially imposed each zoning regulation is intended to protect the interests of both present and future neighbors and the general public each standard is developed as a regulatory response to an identifiable potential negative impact a sound interpretation of any standard cannot be ensured without careful analysis of the regulation and the end toward which it is directed it is understood that there may be other public purposes underlying the interpretation which are not explicitly articulated b articulate the actual impact of various proposed interpretations permitting flexibility in design and prohibiting any interpretation that lowers the protection afforded to the public rationale there is a critical distinction between an interpretation which provides a greater degree of design freedom to achieve a permitted land use and an interpretation which permits a new or not previously permitted use or which allows a use to be enlarged or have its intensity increased beyond the degree specified in the freedom is to be encouraged while a lowering of the standards of this to be prohibited c determine whether the proposed interpretation will ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who will be affected by that persons land use proposal rationale if an interpretation would merely allow a design solution that is slightly different from the one expressly stated or permitted and if it would result in a same or greater degree of protection to any affected party either the adjoining landowners the public at large andor a future property owner or renter such an interpretation may be appropriately made any interpretation which would result in any identifiable loss of protection for one group to the benefit of others is contrary to the spirit of this any interpretation which would either increase the nuisance potential of any use or alter the purpose for which the regulation was adopted shall be considered counter to the legislative intent of this interpretation which will result in any loss of protection or increase in intensity beyond that already permitted shall only be made if the party interpreting this the power to impose additional restrictions or requirements and exercise this power in order to protect the public d this been carefully designed by the town board to combine maximum achievement of public goals and the protection of adjoining property owners while providing flexibility for property owners to use their land for a variety of uses consistent with the goals and objectives of the comprehensive plan for the town of

permitted by right a special use or a conditional use in another zoning district if the use is not listed as permitted in the zoning district of the subject property see  3 no interpretation shall permit a land use in a zoning district unless evidence is presented which demonstrates that the land use will comply with any and all regulations applicable to development in the subject propertys zoning district see  4 no interpretation shall permit a land use in a particular zoning district unless such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted in that same district and is more similar to such other uses than to uses either not permitted in said district or permitted in a more intensive district in the same zoning district category see  5 if the proposed land use is more similar to a land use permitted only as a conditional use in the subject propertys district than to a use permitted by right then an interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned upon the

nonagricultural performance standards promulgated in rules by the wisconsin department of natural resources under nr  wis adm 2 findings of fact the town board finds that uncontrolled postconstruction runoff has a significant impact upon water resources and the health safety and general welfare of the community and diminishes the public enjoyment and use of natural resources specifically uncontrolled postconstruction runoff can a degrade physical stream habitat by increasing stream bank erosion increasing streambed scour diminishing groundwater recharge diminishing stream base flows and increasing stream temperature b diminish the capacity of lakes and streams to support fish aquatic life recreational and water supply uses by increasing pollutant loading of sediment suspended solids nutrients heavy metals bacteria pathogens and other urban pollutants c alter wetland communities by changing wetland hydrology and by increasing pollutant loads d reduce the quality of groundwater by increasing pollutant loading e threaten public health safety property and general welfare by overtaxing storm sewers drainageways and other minor drainage facilities f threaten public health safety property and general welfare by increasing major flood peaks and volumes g undermine floodplain management efforts by increasing the incidence and levels of flooding 3 purpose and intent a purpose  the general purpose of this section is to establish longterm postconstruction runoff management requirements that will diminish the threats to public health safety welfare and the aquatic environment specific purposes are to 1 further the maintenance of safe and healthful conditions 2 prevent and control the adverse effects of stormwater  prevent and control soil erosion  prevent and control water pollution  protect spawning grounds fish and aquatic life  control building sites placement of structures and land uses  preserve ground cover and scenic beauty  and promote sound
