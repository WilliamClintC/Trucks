service redeveloping and growth areas  iii economic competition with other cities which used economic incentives to attract revenue generating businesses and development  iv high commercial vacancies and a lack of commercial facilities to create a vibrant downtown  v dilapidated unattractive obsolete and deteriorated buildings and stagnant property values  and vi community demographics with low income levels high unemployment and lack of adequate housing these factors continue to discourage development in the community b accomplishments of redevelopment program since the formation of the

dollars in building various public buildings and improvements  has redeveloped historic downtown properties such as the oddfellows building the fox theater the hendon building the nickles building the willens building and the coplin house at a cost of approximately three and onehalf million dollars  has brought the sixtyeight million dollars justice center to downtown which will bring six courtrooms some three hundred jobs some five hundred to one thousand people in daily court business and will serve as a center of activity in downtown which project is also leading to the twentythree

by law when such actions are taken or required to be taken the associated service station is rendered unusable and is a nonuse c absent an express showing to the contrary it is hereby declared that closed vacant and inoperative automobile service stations constituting a nonuse cannot be utilized for the purposes originally established because the condition of the tanks prevents or substantially hinders the economically viable use or capacity of the property in that the cost of restoring the tanks is inconsistent with any investment backed expectation of a reasonable return on investment from service station operations d it is hereby declared that the existence of any closed vacant and inoperative automobile service station site in a nonuse condition is injurious and dangerous to the health safety and welfare of this community in that such condition contributes to depreciated or stagnant property values constitutes an abandoned building and a fire hazard and may be a parcel which is substandard with respect to current requirements for establishment of a service station within the city such properties are therefore an aesthetic and economic blight and a contributing cause of decreasing value to the surrounding properties such nonuse service station also invites vandalism and illegal dumping and limits opportunity for proper development of the subject site and surrounding properties e a service station may be a nonuse as defined herein however because of its conversion to a nonservice station use and because of its present occupancy for such postconversion use the property may as of the effective date of this chapter provide an economic return to the current owner unless and until any such property is brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter

contained herein are necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace health or safety within the incorporated areas of the city this determination is based on the following facts and circumstances 1 while the city has always prohibited the personal use and sale of any fireworks within the city persistent violations of this regulation continue and the city has experienced a number of fireworksrelated fires in the recent past which have caused damage to personal property and threatened the lives and property of city residents historically the sale purchase use storage and disposal of fireworks have reached serious proportions in the city endangering the public safety of its citizens such that stronger penalties are needed the personal use and sale of illegal fireworks in the city are an immediate threat to the public peace health and safety 2 illegal fireworks are a serious concern in the city for several reasons first fireworks are frequently sold to children according to the us fire administration children under the age of fifteen suffered fortyfive percent of all injuries from fireworks in 2003 second fireworks are often stored without precautions in residential neighborhoods in march 200 in los angeles county a cache of illegally stored fireworks destroyed a lakewood home when the fireworks erupted in a massive explosion that knocked the house off its foundation and damage several houses and cars nearby third fireworks can be disassembled for the explosive powder they contain to make bombs and other explosive devices fourth and finally many fireworks come from mexico where safety regulations for making fireworks are not as stringent as for those fireworks manufactured in the united states or those approved by the office of the california state fire marshal 3 it is well evident that illegal fireworks lead to hazardous situations injuries personal property loss and fires which jeopardize the safety of the public and increase the cost of fire protection and law enforcement moreover in light of the citys geographical location the city is subject to extreme fire hazards due to topography chaparral type vegetation and hot dry and windy summer conditions as well as hot dry santa ana wind conditions making illegal fireworks activities extremely dangerous to all citizens of the city and not just to those possessing and using illegal fireworks 4 in the past two years the banning police department has responded to two hundred sixtyfive fireworks related calls for service this number does not reflect the number of calls handled by the fire department or the contacts made for fireworks violations where incident numbers were not generated 5 the number of fires caused by fireworks in riverside county has steadily increased in recent years in 200 sixtythree fires in the county were caused by fireworks the number rose to seventy fires in 2004 and seventynine fires in 2005 6 even with enforcement and prosecution the personal sale and use of fireworks is extremely difficult for local authorities to deter since the current penalties and fines for these illegal activities are minimal there is a very lucrative black market for fireworks often making the sale and manufacturing of illegal fireworks profitable despite the current penalties allowed for under city ordinances the seizure of illegal fireworks is further complicated as public safety agencies are not currently funded to cover the full cost of the transport storage and disposal of illegal fireworks after they are confiscated 7 immediate action is needed to increase the penalties for the use sale transportation and manufacturing of fireworks in the city to deter the continued illegal activities and preserve the public peace health safety and welfare the provisions of this chapter shall apply in all of the incorporated areas of the city    definitions whenever in this chapter or in any resolution or standard adopted by the city council pursuant to

anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in d f floodways areas located within areas of special flood hazard established in b are areas designated as floodways since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris potential projectiles and erosion potential the following provisions apply 1 prohibit encroachments including fill new construction substantial improvement and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge 2 if subsection f1 of this section is satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section a6   variances a nature of variances 1 the issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance 2 the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted by the floodplain administrator for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners 3 it is the duty of the city of banning to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can be met only if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance may be granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate b variance appeal board in passing upon appeals of requests for variances which have been denied by the floodplain administrator the city council of the city of banning shall sit as a variance appeal board to consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges c conditions for variances 1 generally variances may be issued by the floodplain administrator for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of of this chapter have been considered fully as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2 variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure 3 variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 4 variances shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city of banning need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance 5 any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that a the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and b such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the riverside recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land 6 the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency 7 variances shall be issued only upon a a showing of good and sufficient cause  b determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in subsection a2 of this section and this chapter to the applicant  and c determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense create a nuisance as defined in see public safety or nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 8 variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a f have been satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance upon consideration of the factors of a2 and the purposes of this chapter the city of banning may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter a7 open space and park fees   purpose the fees established pursuant to this chapter are assessed

western riverside county transportation uniform mitigation fee program    91117   findings a the city is a member agency of the western riverside council of governments wrcog a joint powers agency comprised of the county of riverside and eighteen cities located in western riverside county acting in concert the wrcog member agencies developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the regional system of highways and arterials in western riverside county the regional system could be made up in part by a transportation uniform mitigation fee tumf on future residential commercial and industrial development a map depicting the boundaries of western riverside county and the regional system is attached here as exhibit a and incorporated herein as a member agency of wrcog and as a tumf participating jurisdiction the city participated in the preparation of a certain western riverside county transportation uniform fee nexus study dated  the nexus study prepared in compliance with the mitigation fee act gov et seq and adopted by the wrcog executive committee based on the 2002 nexus study the city adopted and implemented an ordinance authorizing the citys participation in a tumf program b wrcog with the assistance of tumf participating jurisdictions has prepared an updated nexus study entitled transportation uniform mitigation fee nexus study 2016 update  nexus study pursuant to california government et seq the mitigation fee act for the purpose of updating the fees on  the wrcog executive committee reviewed the 2016 nexus study and tumf program and recommended tumf participating jurisdictions amend their applicable tumf ordinances to reflect changes in the tumf network and the cost of construction in order to update the tumf program c consistent with its previous findings made in the adoption of the city council has been informed and advised and hereby finds that if the capacity of the regional system is not enlarged and unless development contributes to the cost of improving the regional system the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of western riverside county with unacceptable levels of service furthermore the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional system will substantially impair the ability of public safety services police and fire to respond and thus adversely affect the public health safety and welfare therefore continuation of a tumf program is essential d the city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the tumf and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety health and welfare of the residential and nonresidential users of the development in which the tumf will be levied e the city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional system and the type of development projects on which the tumf is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential and nonresidential users of such projects to have access to the regional system such development will benefit from the regional system improvements and the burden of such developments will be mitigated in part by payment of the tumf f the city council finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the new 2016 nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional system improvements and the facilities that compromise the regional system and that the amount of the tumf expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development g the fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used to help pay for the design planning construction of and real acquisition for the regional system improvements and its facilities as identified in the 2016 nexus study the need for the improvements and facilities is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic and creates the demand for the improvements h by notice duly given and published the city council set the time and place for a public hearing on the 2016 nexus study and the fees proposed thereunder and at least ten days prior to this hearing the city council made the 2016 nexus study available to the public i at the time and place set for the hearing the city council duly considered data and information provided by the public relative to the cost of the improvements and facilities for which the fees are proposed and all other comments whether written or oral submitted prior to the conclusion of the hearing j the city council finds that the 2016 nexus study proposes a fair and equitable method for distributing a portion of the unfunded costs of improvements and facilities to the regional system k the city council hereby adopts the

are intended as a reference to help the developer in understanding the citys objectives for high quality residential development which retains its appearance functionality and value over time and which adds to the community rather than detracting from it the guidelines are a component of and complement the mandatory land use district development standards in this zoning these design guidelines may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects these design guidelines are broken out into two categories single family residential and multifamily residential zoning 3106  9102051   applicability a the guidelines in this article shall apply to all residential development within the city including additions remodelling relocation and new construction b these design guidelines shall be followed unless there is a compelling reason as to why they cannot be followed if a guideline is waived by the approving authority the mayor and city council shall be notified the mayor or any city council person may appeal the waiver within 15 days of its approval zoning 3106  9102052   singlefamily site planning a the single family site planning guidelines are intended to create highly functional neighborhoods and visual variety along local streets these guidelines encourage the incorporation of natural elements such as hills mature trees and streams into the fabric of residential neighborhoods these guidelines intend to encourage 1 varied footprints  2 varied setbacks  3 varied placement of houses on adjacent lots  4 slowing vehicular traffic  5 preserve the natural land forms  6 prevent stark unbroken walls  7 and uninterrupted straight streets where the noise and speed of the streets predominate over the quiet and safety and calm of the residences in the neighborhood b all singlefamily subdivision plans which include alternative lot sizes will be evaluated using the guidelines contained in this section with emphasis on the following criteria 1 the placement and mix of lots  2 the preservation of wildlife habitat including mature trees wildlife corridors and natural features such as streams  3 the preservation of views of all natural elements of the landscape including ridgelines hills lakes wetlands streams trees shrubs and wildlife habitat  4 the varied placement of dwelling units on a lot  5 provision of amenities such as landscaping green space native vegetation subdivision entrance treatments and so on  6 the treatment of drainage and runoff from rain  7 wall and fence treatments  8 and other unique amenities c varied front setbacks the varied placement of homes and garages close to the street or further back from the street can create more interesting patterns of visible open space designers should strive to avoid uniform and monotonous setbacks along any street and should vary setbacks to enhance the feeling of open space d interruption of straight streets when new streets are created curved street designs are strongly encouraged over straight street designs elements such as knuckles landscape medians pavement enhancements should be introduced to limit the length of straight stretches streets should be connected and culdesacs eliminated rearloaded garages are encouraged e varied side yard setbacks the distance between adjoining homes as well as between homes and fences or walls should be varied as this will result in more unique and interesting types of yards play areas gardens and patio areas f attached dwellings attached or clustered dwellings can create larger open areas between structures and they can be designed to appear either attached or detached designers might consider using attached dwellings in certain sections of residential development g lot orientation are located on curves or at corners can often be oriented in a different direction than lots in the middle of the block such lots may be nonrectangular and may be angled on the street structures should be oriented so that a majority of primary living spaces receive direct sunlight during daylight hours in new developments structures should be positioned minimize the impact of shadows on adjacent properties and within the project h varied lot widths on narrow lots a variation of just a few feet in lot width can make a perceptible difference making some lots wider than average and other lots narrower than average can make the neighborhood more interesting can allow for different configurations of open space and can allow placement of different sizes and shapes of homes i varied garage placement and orientation lot size permitting garages can be placed on the front side of the house and can be entered from the front or from the side garages can also vary in size and can be detached or connected to the primary residence and can be accessed from the front or year yard j zero lot line homes planned unit developments allow for homes to be placed flush against the side lot lines such zero lot line homes are compatible with the creation of sizes and shapes of patios play areas gardens and courts which could not occur in a traditional center plot layout k straight and curved streets although long straight streets are often the most efficient layout curves can provide more interesting and varied street scenes and show harmony with the landscape and topography and integration of a residential neighborhood into its natural surroundings whenever significant natural features are encountered in a development such as hills rivers mature trees chaparrals wetlands and the like such features should signal the designer that one or more curves may be beneficial to the street layout l walls walls and fences are an important part of the streetscape and should be designed thoughtfully walls and fences should have the following characteristics 1 both sides of all perimeter walls or fences should be architecturally treated 2 walls should be of smooth stucco finish or of plaster or of other approved masonry or stonework they should be designed in a style materials and color to complement the adjacent dwelling units 3 additional materials may include tile insets grillwork and wrought iron the preferred choice for wrought iron is one inch pickets at a maximum of six inches on center 4 decorative block can be used but should complement the adjacent dwelling unit 5 chain link fences and barbed wire are not acceptable materials 6 wood wrought iron masonry vinyl and adobe are acceptable fencewall materials 7 decorative masonry walls including but not limited to slump stone and splitface block can be used without a stucco or plaster finish but must be architecturally treated and complement the adjacent dwelling units 8 all property fencing must be compatible in design and of similar materials m garages garages shall be a minimum of four hundred square feet and shall exhibit the following characteristics 1 garage door setbacks should allow driveway parking that keeps the sidewalk free of vehicles and passable by pedestrians and cyclists 2 angled garages may be used on curvilinear streets where they can provide an element of harmony with the flow of the street and may be used on straight streets where they can break up the monotony of all garage doors being parallel to the street 3 garages should have a single story mass at the front of the structures to provide an architectural transition in two story massing n infill in existing neighborhoods new singlefamily homes in existing neighborhoods should be integrated into the neighborhoods in characteristics such as scale building height architectural style facade treatment landscaping setbacks and other characteristics in many older neighborhoods common patterns such as entries facing the street front porches and parking at the rear may be continued o setbacks 1 setbacks of residential projects should be either a equal to the average setback of all residences on both sides of public streets within one hundred feet of the property lines of the new project or b equal to the average of the two immediately adjacent residences in either case the new residence may be averaged in a stepping pattern between the setbacks of adjacent residences 2 architectural style distinctive architectural characteristics of surrounding developments such as materials roof style and pitch finished floor heights porches window and door treatments fidelity to formal traditional architectural styles and related elements should be incorporated into new residential development when possible 3 scale building scale and form should relate to the use of the structure as a singlefamily dwelling structures consistent with the existing neighborhood so as not to overwhelm or dominate the neighborhood 4 massing long uninterrupted exterior walls should be avoided on all structures all structure walls should have relief to create an interesting blend with landscaping structures shadows and light the articulation of facades and the massing of structures tends to give them richness and scale incorporation of varied texture relief and design elements on building walls can soften the appearance of the residence p grading graded slopes should be rounded and contoured to blend with the natural terrain significant natural vegetation shall be retained and incorporated into the project development should relate to the natural surroundings and minimize grading by following natural contours developers should consult with the community development department early in the process to ensure compliance with this guideline zoning 3106  9102053     singlefamily architecture the focus of development should be on the creation of high quality residential environments although there is no particular required architectural style for any of bannings neighborhoods architecture should be compatible with surrounding character including harmonious building style form size color materials orientation and roofline residences should be compatible with one another but each should be unique in its own way a facade and roof articulation 1 long uninterrupted exterior walls should be avoided on all structures all structure walls should have relief to create an interesting blend with landscaping structures shadows and light the articulation of facades and the massing of structures tends to give them richness and scale incorporation of varied texture relief and design elements on building walls can soften the appearance of the residence 2 for sloped roofs both vertical and horizontal articulation is encouraged roof articulation may be achieved by changes in plane of at least two feet and six inches and use of traditional elements such as gables hips and dormers flat roofs are strongly discouraged and aframe type roofs are generally simpler and less articulated than what would be considered ideal b varied structure design in tract developments structures should be designed to create variety and interest there should be a significant difference in the exterior finish massing and composition of adjacent houses one design should not be repeated more often than every fourth house c attached dwellings 1 single family attached dwellings should be designed in a way which projects an image of high quality customized homes preferred configurations include treatment as apparently large single family units or as traditional row houses or town houses 2 features such as walls should be incorporated to lengthen the horizontal elements of elevations and to reduce the visual impact of garage doors 3 driveways should be grouped with a separate planting strip to provide maximum usable green space lawn and gardening areas 4 garages must be set back from the street sufficiently to allow driveway parking without the intrusion of cars into the sidewalk thus blocking the way of cyclists or pedestrians in addition garages should have a single story appearance at the front of the building to allow a steppedback architectural transition for two story structures d scale building scale and form should relate to the use of the structure as a single family dwelling structures should be built on a human scale so as not to overwhelm or dominate the neighborhood or the residents of the immediate dwelling or adjacent dwellings e finish materials 1 materials to be avoided include metal or aluminum siding and roofs reflective materials and finishes and unfinished concrete block 2 the use of different materials on different planes tends to make the materials appear substantial and integral material changes not accompanied by changes in plane also frequently give material an insubstantial or applied quality 3 all structure elements should be architecturally treated the proper choice and mix of materials on the facades of structures and garage doors is instrumental in providing an attractive living environment materials should be consistently applied and should work harmoniously with adjacent materials piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in materials should be avoided f vents and downspouts gutters roof flashing downspouts vents and other roof features and protrusions should be finished to match the adjacent materials and or colors g equipment screening all heating and air conditioning equipment pool equipment etc must be located in the side or year yard and must be screened the method of screening must be architecturally compatible in terms of materials color finish shape and size the screening design should blend wit the building design where individual equipment is provided a continuous screen is desirable landscaping of sufficient density and height may be used for equipment screening h ancillary structures ancillary structures such as guest houses accessory dwelling units barns storage sheds cabanas and the like should be designed to be architecturally compatible with the main structure use of walls roofs trellises fences wall connections andor landscaping i garage doors garage doors provide a major visual element of a home they should appear to be set into the walls rather than flush with the exterior wall and garage door design should be kept simple clean and unadorned j lighting fixturesintensity strong and harsh lighting has been shown to be a major stressor to wildlife places excess emphasis on a dwelling eliminates night time views and is intrusive to neighbors and thus is strongly discouraged all on site lighting shall be stationary light source shall not be visible carefully directed away from adjacent properties and public rightsofway and of no more than the intensity appropriate to the residential use of the property zoning 3106  9102054  101017   multifamily site planning cluster housing and multifamily dwellings tend to create large parking areas and a decrease in private open space due to their higher densities if not well designed parking facilities can dominate the site and open spaces may be relegated to left over areas which are not integrated with the structures or the people who live there residential developments surrounded by long high walls parking lots and rows of carports along public streets are examples of practices to be avoided perimeter parking drives are discouraged because they eliminate so much green space  provide a poor image of a residential development  and often function as barriers between the development and the surrounding community including other residences businesses and the natural environment a building articulation in multi family dwellings building facades should be broken up and articulated to give the appearance of a collection of smaller structures long unbroken facades and boxlike forms should be avoided each unit should be distinguishable from adjacent units differentiation of units can be accomplished with the use of varied roof heights colors finish materials balconies setbacks and projections which help articulate individual dwelling units or collections of units as well as by the pattern and rhythm of doors and windows b clustering of units the clustering of multi family units should be a standard element of site plan design structures which are composed of simple yet varied planes enhance variety and compatibility in the overall building form design techniques to be considered and implemented whenever possible include 1 staggered and jogged unit planes  2 varying front setbacks within the same structure  3 the incorporation of varied rooflines and wall lines  4 the use of a variety of orientations to avoid visual monotony c project entries attention should always be given to architectural and landscape treatments of entryways to enhance the overall image of a project entry areas should incorporate landscaping recreational facilities and project directories when possible d entry drives colored and textured paving treatment at entry drives is encouraged however stamped concrete is not permitted within public street rights of way the principal vehicular access into a multi family housing development should be entry drive rather than a parking drive e onsite parking and drives parking may be accommodated in higher density projects use of parking drives parking courts underground garages and garages within residential buildings developments with long monotonous parking drives or with large undivided parking lots should be avoided when parking can not be provided within residential structures dispersed parking courts are the desired alternative perimeter parking drives should be minimized and residents often like to have a view of the parking areas which they utilize f parking courts parking courts should be separated from each other by dwelling units or by a landscaped buffer of at least 30 feet in width ideally parking courts should not consist of more than two or three double loaded parking bays adjacent to each other g parking drives 1 there should be no more than an average of 10 spaces of uninterrupted parking whether in garages carports or open parking areas although longer rows of parking may be necessary in larger residential developments 2 each average of 10 spaces of parking should be separated from additional spaces by a substantial landscaped bulb typically not less than 10 feet wide recreational amenities open space areas and project access points architectural elements such as trellises porches benches or stairways may extend into these landscaped bulbs h garages garages with parking aprons less than twenty feet in length should have automatic garage door openers and or sectional roll up doors individual parking garages within residential structures should be enclosed behind garage doors i carports 1 carports should not be incorporated into exterior project walls when these walls are adjacent to streets the ends of each cluster of carports should be landscaped to provide variety and visual stimulation carports can be a useful element in providing shading and cooling for automobiles 2 where carports are utilized they must follow the same criteria for spatial arrangements as parking courts as described previously in this chapter carports may be incorporated with patio walls or used to help define public and private open space j pedestrian access from parking whenever possible landscape bulbs should align with major building entrances to provide pedestrian access to the building entrance from a parking court or drive when landscape bulbs are aligned with entrances they should be at least two car spaces wide and should include a pathway as well as vertical landscaping and architectural elements such as trees trellises sculpture hedges and the like k open space 1 open space should be maximized in all multifamily housing developments at least 50% of open space should be grassed landscaped or otherwise vegetated the placement of benches is encouraged to help people to make use of and enjoy the space 2 wildlife corridors should also be considered in a residential development native plants and shrubs shall be preserved and incorporated into the development wherever possible 3 the design and orientation of open space areas should take advantage of available sunlight and should be sheltered from the noise and traffic of adjacent streets or other incompatible uses required common open spaces should be conveniently located for the majority of units private open spaces should be contiguous to the units they serve and should be screened from public view whenever possible childrens play areas should be visible from the units l landscape areas 1 good landscaping can help to bring a residential development into greater harmony with its surrounding natural environment landscaping can be used to frame soften and embellish the quality of the environment  to buffer units from noise or undesirable views  to break up large expanses of parking  and to separate frontage roads within a project from public streets 2 in addition to grass and groundcover trees and tall shrubs are needed trees can provide a vertical design element which enhances visual interest trees can also be used to provide shading and climactic cooling of nearby residential units and parking spaces entrances to residential developments should when possible be oriented toward the green space open space and recreational areas of the development m refuse storagedisposal 1 trash bins must be fully enclosed and block stone and other masonry enclosures are preferred such enclosures shall be softened with landscaping on their most visible sides recommended locations for refuse storage bins include inside parking courts or at the end of the parking bays 2 locations should be conveniently accessible for trash collection and maintenance and should not block access to drives during loading operations n auxiliary facilities all auxiliary and support structures within multifamily residential projects such as laundry facilities recreation buildings and sales lese offices should be consistent in architectural design materials faade treatments and landscaping with the rest of the complex temporary sales offices should also be compatible with these guidelines o mailboxes all mailbox locations in multifamily developments must be approved by the us postal service common mailbox services shall be provided in all multifamily developments they should be located close to the project entry and near recreational facilities their architectural character should be similar in form materials and color to the surrounding buildings p site grading 1 ideally multifamily dwellings should be placed six inches or more above the average grade of the site site grading should recognize existing drainage patterns an d landforms while providing appropriate transition of architectural elements to grade grade separations should be minimized as much as possible as should retaining walls 2 site grading should provide for an uninterrupted flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic development the plan shall direct and provide adequate flow of surface runoff to catch basins while gracefully contouring the land to blend with existing conditions at the boundaries of the site 3 the use of centerswale drainage devices is strongly discouraged parking lots may drain into a single concrete swale at the edge of the aisle street drainage should be collected in curb gutters q security multi family dwellings should be designed to provide the maximum amount of security for residents and visitors landscaping should be planned and maintained to provide views into open space areas r lighting fixturesintensity 1 strong and harsh lighting has been shown to be a major stressor to wildlife and thus is strongly discouraged all on site lighting shall be stationary carefully directed away from adjacent properties and public rightsofway and of no more than the intensity appropriate to the residential use of the property 2 strong lighting also places excess emphasis on residential developments in a manner which makes them stand apart from other residential developments and other uses and calls attention to the development in a negative way some carefully directed lighting may be used in parking areas for security purposes lighting must be directed towards the ground rather than toward the sky and overspill into residences must be minimized zoning 3106  9102055   multifamily architecture the focus of multifamily residential development should be on the creation of high quality residential environments although there is no particular required architectural style for any of bannings neighborhoods or zoning districts architecture should be compatible with that of the surrounding residences and buildings compatibility should include harmonious building style as well as form size scale color height materials finish orientation and roofline multifamily residences should be compatible with one another but each should be unique in some way multifamily residences are often developed adjacent to single family neighborhoods and measures should be taken to ensure that the height and bulk of higher density projects do not negatively impact these lower density residential areas multifamily architecture should create the appearance of individual units and should use same the same quality of materials and treatments as singlefamily homes whenever possible garages are encouraged over the use of carports a facade and roof articulation 1 long uninterrupted exterior walls should be avoided on all structures all structure walls should have relief to create an interesting blend with landscaping structures shadows and light extremely long structures are acceptable if they are appropriately articulated however structures exceeding 150 feet in length are discouraged 2 separations changes in plane and height and the inclusion of elements such as balconies porches arcades dormers and cross gables mitigate the barracks like quality of flat wall and roofs of excessive length secondary hipped or gabled roofs covering the entire mass of a building are preferable to segments of pitched roof applied at the structures edge 3 structures containing three or more attached dwellings in a row should incorporate at least one of the following a for each dwelling unit at least one architectural projection not less than two feet from the wall plane and not less than four feet wide should be provided such projections should extend the full height of the single story structures at least half the height of a two story building and at least two thirds the height of a three story building b changes in wall plane of at least three feet in depth for at least twelve feet in length for each two units should be provided b scale 1 building scale and form should relate to the use of the structure as a multifamily dwelling structures should be built on a human scale so as not to overwhelm or dominate the neighborhood or the residents of the immediate dwelling or adjacent dwellings 2 as multifamily developments are usually taller than one story their bulk can be imposing on surrounding uses and on single family homes the scale of such projects should be moderated by the context of their surroundings 3 structures with more stories should be given additional setback when possible to avoid dominating the character of the neighborhood large projects should be broken into groups of structures and the use of single mega structures for multifamily development shall be avoided this pertains to developments having residents of any and all income levels c buildingfinish materials 1 materials selected for multifamily projects should be very durable and require low maintenance materials to be avoided include metal or aluminum siding and roofs reflective materials and finishes and unfinished concrete block 2 materials tend to appear substantial and integral when material changes occur at changes in plane material changes not accompanied by changes in plane also frequently give material an insubstantial or applied quality 3 all structure elements in multifamily developments should be architecturally treated and piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in materials shall be avoided d balconies porches and patios 1 common exterior balconies walkways and corridors which provide access to multiple dwelling units do not require circulation past adjacent unit windows and entries separations in such exterior balconies and corridors can help light to filter down to the lower floors and can add vibrancy to the exterior ground floor corridors 2 the incorporation of balconies porches and patios whether private or accessible to use by all residents within multifamily structures is strongly encouraged for both practical and aesthetic value these elements should be integrated to break up large wall masses offset floor setbacks and add human scale to structures 3 unique private nooks and niches are encouraged for the individual units within these multifamily developments e dwelling unit access 1 whenever possible individual access should be created for each and every unit whenever possible landscape bulbs should align with major building entrances to provide pedestrian access to the building entrance from a parking court or drive 2 the use of long monotonous balconies and corridors providing access to five or more units should be avoided access points to units should be clustered in groups of four or less the use of distinctive architectural elements and materials to denote prominent entrances is encouraged f exterior stairs 1 projections of stairways which are wide bold and simple are encouraged to complement the architectural massing and form of the multifamily structure the greater the width of the exterior stairways the easier it will be for residents to move in and out and for equipment white goods household appliances and furniture to move in and out of the development 2 stairways should be of smooth stucco plaster or block with accent trim of complimentary colors stone or tile work thin looking open metal or wood prefabricated stairs are discouraged as they are generally insufficient for multifamily residences g carports garages and accessory structures 1 parking garages within multifamily residential structures should be enclosed behind garage doors carports detached garages and accessory structures should be designed as an integral part of the architecture of the projects 2 they should be similar in materials color and detail to the principal structures of the development carports may utilize flat roofs but should not project above any exterior walls adjacent to streets 3 prefabricated metal carports may not be used when garages are utilized doors should appear set into walls rather than flush with the exterior wall their design should be simple and unadorned yet high quality materials should be used such h gutters and downspouts 1 gutters roof flashing downspouts vents and other such features and protrusions should be finished to match the adjacent materials andor colors gutters and downspouts should be concealed unless they are designed as a continuous architectural feature 2 exposed gutters used as architectural features should be colored to match fascia or wall material exposed downspouts should be colored to match the surface to which they are attached unless copper is used roof vents should be colored to match roofing materials or the dominant trim color of the structure i active and passive solar design solar panels should be integrated into the roof design flush with the roof slope especially on those portions of the roof with eastern western or southern exposures frames should be colored to match roofing materials or the dominant trim color of the structure aluminum or similar finishes are strongly discouraged any mechanical equipment should be enclosed and completely screened from view j mechanical and utility equipment 1 utility meters and equipment must be placed in locations which are not exposed to view from the street or from the general grounds and they must be suitably screened or hidden by bushes hedges or other landscaping while still remaining accessible 2 all screening devices are to be compatible with the architecture and color of the adjacent structures all mechanical equipment whether mounted on the roof or ground must be screened from view k antennas 1 all new units must be prewired to accommodate cable reception all antennas should be placed in attics or building interiors 2 satellite antennas are specifically prohibited on roofs and should be considered early in the design process in terms of location and any required screening l walls walls and fences are an important part of the streetscape and should be designed thoughtfully walls and fences should have the following characteristics 1 both sides of all perimeter walls or fences should be architecturally treated 2 walls should be of smooth stucco finish or of plaster or of other approved masonry or stonework they should be designed in a style materials and color to complement the adjacent dwelling units 3 chain link fences and barbed wire are not acceptable materials 4 wood masonry vinyl and adobe are acceptable fencewall materials 5 decorative masonry walls including but not limited to slump stone and splitface block can be used without a stucco or plaster finish but must be architecturally treated and complement the adjacent dwelling units 6 all property fencing must be compatible in design and of similar materials zoning 3106  9102056     multifamily infill in single family neighborhood new multifamily developments should be integrated into existing neighborhoods so that they are compatible with adjacent structures and fit within the context of the existing neighborhood whether that neighborhood be residential or mixed use a front yard setbacks for new multifamily projects front yard setbacks should be equal to or greater than the average setbacks for the two adjacent properties if one or both of the adjacent properties are vacant then the average shall be calculated on the next adjacent occupied property b architectural compatibility new multifamily residential development in existing neighborhoods should incorporate architectural characteristics and maintain the scale of existing structures on the property and surrounding development this includes window and door detailing facade decoration materials color roof style and pitch porches and other elements c site design new multifamily developments should be designed to continue the onsite relationships of the surrounding neighborhood and of the original structures when it is possible to provide access from adjacent alleys it is generally advantageous to do so zoning 3106  9102057 commercial and industrial districts general provisions   purposedistricts designated a this chapter is intended to support the development of a broad range of commercial and industrial businesses by 1 preventing uses which are incompatible with commercial and industrial land uses from locating in these districts 2 providing for different types of commercial and industrial land uses which can locate in areas where they are assured compatible neighbors 3 providing sufficient safeguards for the citys residents and workers by providing for buffers clean industry and safe circulation 4 minimizing the negative impacts of traffic intensity such as noise polluted air gridlock and danger to pedestrians 5 planning for the provision of public improvements and infrastructure to serve bannings commercial and industrial neighborhoods 6 improving declining or blighted commercial and industrial areas b each of the commercial and industrial districts being created is described below 1 downtown commercial dc a this district occurs on ramsey street between 8th street and hargrave street on the west and east by

council shall be notified an appeal which does not require a fee may be filed by the mayor or any council person within fifteen days of the waiver approval 1 use a brief message the fewer the words the more effective the sign a sign with a brief succinct message is simpler and faster to read looks cleaner and is more attractive 2 avoid hardtoread overly intricate typefaces these typefaces are difficult to read and reduce the signs ability to communicate 3 avoid faddish and bizarre typefaces such typefaces may look good today but soon go out of style the image conveyed may quickly become that of a dated and unfashionable business 4 sign colors and materials should be selected to contribute to legibility and design integrity even the most carefully thought out sign may be unattractive and a poor communicator because of poor color selection dayglo colors must be avoided 5 use significant contrast between the background and letter or symbol colors if there is little contrast between the brightness or hue of the message of a sign and its background it will be difficult to read 6 avoid too many different colors on a sign too many colors overwhelm the basic function of communication the colors compete with content for the viewers attention limited use of the accent colors can increase legibility while large areas of competing colors tend to confuse and disturb 7 place signs to indicate the location of access to a business signs should be placed at or near the entrance to a building or site to indicate the most direct access to the business 8 place signs consistent with the proportions of scale of building elements within the facade within a building facade the sign may be placed in different areas a particular sign may fit well on a plain wall area but would overpower the finer scale and proportion of the lower storefront a sign which is appropriate near the building entry may look tiny and out of place above the ground level 9 place wall signs to establish rhythm across the facade scale and proportion where such elements are weak in many buildings that have a monolithic or plain facade signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm scale and proportion 10 avoid signs with strange shapes signs that are unnecessarily narrow or oddly shaped can restrict the legibility of the message if an unusual shape is not symbolic it is probably confusing 11 carefully consider the proportion of letter area to overall sign background area if letters take up too much sign they may be harder to read large letters are not necessarily more legible than smaller ones a general rule is that letters should not appear to occupy more than seventyfive percent of the sign panel area 12 make signs smaller if they are oriented to pedestrians the pedestrianoriented sign is usually read from a distance of fifteen to twenty feet  the vehicleoriented sign is viewed from a much greater distance the closer a signs viewing distance the smaller that sign need be b wall or fascia signs 1 building wall and fascia signs should be compatible with the predominant visual elements of the building commercial centers offices and other similar facilities

type of construction materials cabinet sign copy supports etc b letter size and style of copy c method used for supporting sign wall or ground base d configuration of sign area e shape to total sign and related components 3 the use of graphics consistent with the nature of the product to be advertised is encouraged ie hammer or saw symbol for a hardware store mortar and pestle for a drug store 4 direct and indirect lighting methods are allowed provided that they are not harsh or unnecessarily bright the use of cantype box signs with translucent backlit panels are less desirable panels should be opaque if a cantype sign is used and only the lettering should appear to be lighted the overspill of light should be negligible 5 the use of backlit individually cut letter signs is strongly encouraged 6 the use of permanent sale or comeon signs is prohibited 7 the identification of each building or stores address in sixinch high numbers over the main entry doorway or within ten feet of the main entry is encouraged c monument signs 1 monument signs are intended to provide street addresses and identification for the commercial center development as a whole and for up to three major tenants 2 all tenant signs should be limited in size to the width of the architectural features of the sign and shall be uniform in size and color 3 a minimum of ten percent of the sign area of monument signs for center developments should be devoted to identification of the center or building by address or name 4 monument signs should be placed perpendicular to approaching vehicular traffic 5 each monument sign should be located within a planted landscaped area which is of a shape and design that will provide a compatible setting and ground definition to the sign incorporating the
