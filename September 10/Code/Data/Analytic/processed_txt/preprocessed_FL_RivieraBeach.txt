17 public health  sanitation environmental  subchapter 1 engineering sanitary  group 4 drinking water supplies  purpose of regulations to safeguard drinking water supplies a the purpose of this division is to 1 protect the public water supply against actual or potential crossconnections by isolating within the premises contamination or pollution that may occur because of some undiscovered or unauthorized crossconnection on the premises 2 eliminate existing connections between drinking water systems and other sources of water that are not approved as safe and potable for human consumption 3 eliminate cross connections between drinking water systems and other sources of water or process water used for any purpose whatsoever which jeopardize the safety of the drinking water supply 4 prevent the making of cross connections in the future 5 encourage the exclusive use of public sources of water supply 6 protect the drinking water supply within the premises where plumbing defects or cross connections may endanger the drinking water supply available on the premises b the regulations are to be reasonably interpreted it is the intent of these regulations to recognize that there are varying degrees of hazard and to apply the principle that the degree of protection should commensurate with the degree of hazard c these regulations are not to be construed as prohibiting other governmental authorities from establishing requirements regarding protection of water supply more rigid than herein indicated where circumstances warrant d it is recognized that the control of cross connections requires cooperation between water purveyors and health agencies the water purveyor has a primary responsibility to prevent water from unapproved sources or any other substance entering the public water supply system the health agency has the overall responsibility for preventing water from unapproved sources from entering either the potable water systems within water consumers premises or the public water supply directly  protection of public water system at service connection a all commercial and industrial classifications that are served by the city water and sewer department are required to install and maintain an appropriate backflow prevention device the type and size of the device will be determined by the water and sewer department b all multistory buildings regardless of intended use shall install and maintain all required backflow prevention devices the type and size will be determined by the water and sewer department all singlefamily units will be exempt from this requirement unless it is determined that a special health hazard exists c backflow prevention devices shall be installed on the service connection to any premises that have internal cross connections unless such cross connections are abated to the satisfaction of the water purveyor and approved by the state or local health department d it shall be the responsibility of the water user to provide protective devices as required   2274 11784 type of protection the protective device required shall depend on the degree of hazard as tabulated below 1 at the service connection to any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply handled in a separate piping system with no known cross connection the public water supply shall be protected by an approved doublecheck valve assembly 2 at the service connection to any premises on which a substance that would be objectionable but not necessarily hazardous to health if introduced into the public water supply is handled so as to constitute a cross connection the public water supply shall be protected by an approved doublecheck valve assembly 3 at the service connection on any premises on which there is an auxiliary water supply where cross connections are known to exist which cannot be presently eliminated the public water supply system shall be protected by an approved reducedpressureprinciple backflow prevention device a doublecheck valve assembly may be used in lieu of such device if local experience indicates that doublecheck valves are reliably operated and if approved by the water purveyor and local health agency 4 at the service connection to any premises on which any material dangerous to health or toxic substance in toxic concentration is or may be handled under pressure the public water supply shall be protected by an airgap separation the airgap shall be located as close as practicable to the service cock and all piping between the service cock and receiving tank shall be entirely visible if these conditions cannot reasonably be met the public water supply shall be protected with either an approved reducedpressureprinciple backflow prevention device or an approved doublecheck valve assembly providing the alternative is acceptable to both the water purveyor and the local health department 5 at the service connection to any sewage treatment plant or sewage pumping station the public water supply shall be protected by an airgap separation the airgap shall be located as close as practicable to the service cock and all piping between the service cock and receiving tank shall be entirely visible if these conditions cannot be reasonably met the public water supply shall be protected with an approved reducedpressureprinciple backflow prevention device

inspection of protective devices it shall be the duty of the water user on any premises on account of which backflow protective devices are installed to have competent inspections made at least once a year or more often in those instances where successive inspections indicate repeated failure these devices shall be repaired overhauled or replaced at the expense of the water user whenever they are found to be defective it shall be the duty of the water purveyor and the health department to see that these tests are made in accordance with the responsibility designated records of such tests repairs and overhaul shall be kept and made available to the water purveyor and the local health department  protection of potable water system within premises a separate drinking water systems whenever the health agency determines that it is not practical to protect drinking water systems on premises against entry of water from a source of piping system or equipment that cannot be approved as safe or potable for human use an entirely separate drinking water system shall be installed to supply water at points convenient for consumers b fire system water systems for fighting fire derived from a supply that cannot be approved as safe or potable for human use shall wherever practicable be kept wholly separate from drinking water pipelines and equipment in cases in which the domestic water system is used for both drinking and firefighting purposes approved backflow prevention devices shall be installed to protect such individual drinking water lines as are not used for firefighting purposes it is hereby declared that it is the responsibility of the person causing the introduction of the unapproved or unsafe water into the pipelines to see that a procedure is developed and carried out to notify and protect users of this piping system during the emergency that special precautions are taken to disinfect thoroughly and flush out all pipelines which may have become contaminated before they are again used to furnish drinking water if the means of protection of water consumers is by disinfection of the auxiliary firefighting supply the installation and its use shall be thoroughly reliable when disinfection of the auxiliary supply itself is depended upon to render the water safe the means of applying the disinfectant under this regulation shall be automatic with operation of the pump or pumps employed with the dangerous water in question adequate supplies of chlorine or its compound must be kept on hand at all times chlorine dosing equipment shall be tested daily and kept in good operating condition the public water supply must be protected against backflow from such dual domestic fire systems as detailed under type of protection section 20235 c process waters potable water pipelines connected to equipment for industrial processes or operations shall be disconnected therefrom if practicable where disconnection is not practicable a suitable backflow prevention device located beyond the last point from which drinking water may be taken shall be provided on the feed line to process piping or equipment if the particular process liquid is especially corrosive or apt to prevent reliable action of the backflow prevention device airgap separation shall be provided these devices shall be tested by the water user at least once a year or more often in these instances where successive inspections indicate repeated failure the devices shall be repaired overhauled or replaced whenever they are found to be defective records of tests repairs and replacement shall be kept and made available to the local health department d sewage treatment plants and pumping stations sewage pumps shall not have priming connections directly off any drinking water systems no connections shall exist between the drinking water system and any other piping equipment or tank in any sewage plant or sewage pumping station e plumbing connections where the circumstances are such that there is special danger to health by the backflow of sewage as from sewers toilets hospital bedpans and the like into a drinking water system a dependable device shall be installed to prevent such backflow the purpose of these regulations is not to transcend local plumbing regulations but only to deal with those extraordinary situations in which sewage may be forced or drawn into the drinking water piping these regulations do not attempt to eliminate at this time the hazards of backsiphonage valves on all toilets but deal with those situations where the likelihood of vacuum conditions in the drinking water is definite and there is a special danger to health devices suited to the purpose of avoiding backsiphonage from plumbing fixtures are roof tanks or separate pressure systems separately piped to supply such fixtures recognized approved vacuum or siphon breakers and other backflow protective devices which have been proved by appropriate tests to be dependable for destroying the vacuum inasmuch as many of the serious hazards of this kind are due to water supply piping which is too small thereby causing vacuum conditions when fixtures are flushed or water is drawn from the system in other ways it is recommended that the water supply piping that is too small be enlarged whenever possible f pier and dock hydrants backflow protection by a suitable backflow prevention device shall be provided on each drinking water pier head outlet used for supply vessels at piers or waterfronts these assemblies must be located where they will prevent the return of any water from the vessel into the drinking water pipeline or into another adjacent vessel this will prevent such practices as connecting the ship fire pumping or sanitary pumping system with a dock hydrant and thereby pumping contaminated water into the drinking water system and thence to adjacent vessels or back into the public mains g marking safe and unsafe water lines where the premises contain dual or multiple water systems and piping the exposed portions of pipelines shall be painted banded or marked at sufficient intervals to distinguish clearly which water is safe and which is not safe all outlets from secondary or other potentially contaminated systems shall be posted as being contaminated and unsafe for drinking purposes all outlets intended for drinking purposes shall be plainly marked to indicate that fact  water supervisor a the health department and the water purveyor shall be kept informed of the identity of the person responsible for the water piping on all premises concerned with these regulations at each premises where it is necessary in the opinion of the health department a water supervisor shall be designated this water supervisor shall be responsible for the installation and use of pipelines and equipment and for the avoidance of cross connections b in the event of contamination or pollution of the drinking water system due to a cross connection on the premises the local health officer and water purveyor shall be promptly advised by the person responsible for the water system so that appropriate measures may be taken to overcome the contamination  sanctions for noncompliance failure of the consumer to install maintain or permit the testing and inspection of backflow prevention devices by the city as required in this article shall be grounds for termination of the water service to the premises by the city as provided in this section in the case of an immediate hazard to the public health the water service may be terminated without notice to the consumer immediately although a hearing before the director of utilities shall be immediately scheduled upon request of the consumer to determine the justness and fairness of the water service termination termination of water service will be done within 30 days of second notice of violation 2275 11784 secs 2024020255  reserved article vi  extensions of mains

not incorporated engaged in providing supplies or services related to the construction industry by contract to a general contractor or owner of a job site  7906 purpose of plan the provisions of this chapter are enacted to effectuate the following purposes 1 decrease unemployment by encouraging the hiring of minorities in the construction industry including minority businesses skilled and nonskilled labor and professionals 2 provide a means of increasing the supply of affordable housing in this city 3 encourage revitalization of the downtown particularly mixed use development 4 accomplish the objectives of this section use of a voluntary program utilizing zoningrelated incentives in various zoning districts throughout the city  7906 rationale a solutions to unemployment and lack of affordable housing are two serious challenges facing the city and under current fiscal constraints the government cannot rely solely upon public programs but must work with the private sector b the provisions of this chapter recognize that the private sector has the expertise and resources to aid the city in these areas and that the city may call upon that aid in exchange for compensation c the program is designed so that bonuses will reflect the appropriate economic incentive for the particular use or district making it financially advantageous for the developer to use the bonus and provide employment or housing in return  7906 housing needs potentials and goals a need the need for an increased supply of affordable housing in the city is substantiated by review of the housing market and existing supply for example the average value of house in the county in 2006 was $37500000 this is outside affordable range for city mainland residents indicating the need for means to ensure city residents will be able to become homeowners b potentials for vacant land a substantial amount of vacant land is available for housing both on a large scale and for smaller infill development the area with the greatest potential for receiving affordable housing units is the south central planning sector which is west of old dixie highway and south of blue heron boulevard numerous scattered singlefamily and small multifamily sites are located throughout the city  7906 bonuses offered a generally one of the keys to the success of a voluntary program is the bonuses offered to the developer these bonuses must be attractive enough so that even when something is demanded in return the developer still desires to participate and utilize the bonus b bonuses offered by zoning district table ii lists the bonuses to be offered by zoning district bonuses chosen relate to what has been determined as a financial incentive for a particular zoning district these determinations were made based on staff experience in working with developers and site plans and discussion with industrial and commercial developers for example excessive parking requirements relating to industrial uses are frequently cited by developers so a reduction has been offered as an incentive _____   table ii bonuses offered districts bonus rm20 rh and rmh20 1 density 3 unit per

table iii establishes the relationship of the bonus to the base regulations indicating the ultimate requirements if a bonus is used the base is kept at a reasonable standard so that a developer not using an incentive can still produce a viable project based on current building trends however developers with more ambitious projects will be able to build while contributing towards the goals of

zoning restrictions indiscriminately but to allow for additional leeway upwards within the acceptable bounds of a zoning standard for example a developer cannot simply reduce parking by 20 percent it must be demonstrated that the requirement is unrealistic for a particular use ie based on number of employees or that an alternative plan such as park and ride is available  7906 minority employment component a the purpose of this section is to encourage the developer to hire minorities in various capacities of project development from planning to final construction this will enable the workforce of the city which is predominately minority to directly benefit from the economic boom south florida is experiencing b a zoning bonus or bonuses as set forth in this chapter shall be permitted where the person requesting the bonus enters into a written agreement with the city providing for the following 1 the party requesting the bonus shall employ on the job site at least 20 percent of its parttime and fulltime general labor on a job site from minority groups  2 the party requesting the bonus enters into contracts for work or supplies to a job site with at least ten subtrades or suppliers who are minority employers  and 3 where the party requesting the bonus demonstrates approved minority participation plan the hiring of five minority professionals c while under the minority employment option all three components of subsection b of this section must be met to qualify for a bonus d a developer desiring more than one bonus to the employment option need only satisfy the requirement once to utilize multiple bonuses e prior to project site plan approval the party applying for the bonus shall submit a minority participation plan for council approval as per administrative procedures  7906 housing contribution component a options a developer choosing the housing option will have two methods to choose from to satisfy this requirement 1 construction of affordable units  or 2 in lieu cash contribution to the housing trust fund b extent of contribution 1 the amount of the housing contribution by a developer directly relates to the extent and number of bonuses used as shown in table iv in section 268  ie as the number of bonus units requested increases so does the corresponding housing contribution that must be made 2 it is the intent of the program to encourage construction of units by developers  contribution ratios have been set accordingly 3 it is anticipated that the additional financial gain with incentives should not exceed the costs of participating in the program c construction of affordable units  option 1 1 under this option the developer is responsible for actually constructing the units including purchasing the land the units may be singlefamily or multiplefamily 2 units must meet the definition of affordable housing and be sold or rented to moderateincome families 3 rental units may be rented by the developer or managed by the housing authority or sold to a private party to rent as affordable units 4 affordable units shall be governed by legal covenant which guarantees availability to moderateincome residents for at least five years 5 the principle behind the construction contribution is that while the developer must bear the cost of buying the land and constructing the unit his costs are recovered when it is sold the difference between his cost and the affordable price is his profit 6 under the construction option while time and effort is involved the developer will make a profit or break even his contribution is the production of affordable housing adding to the supply 7 no certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a project utilizing bonuses until the affordable units are complete and have received a certificate of occupancy d in lieu contribution to housing trust fund option 2 1 under this option the developer chooses to contribute directly to the housing trust fund in accordance with table iv in section 268 2 timing of the contribution shall be onehalf to be deposited in fund prior to permit remainder prior to certificate of occupancy  7906 calculating bonus contributions a introduction 1 this section sets forth the means of translating the bonus used into the amount of contribution which is required in return as shown in table iv as table iv indicates available bonuses include a additional density b reduction in number of parking spaces c reduction in size of spaces d additional height e setback waiver f lot coverage g additional uses permitted 2 to simplify contribution calculations the benefits of the above varied bonuses are translated into two bonus measures units or building square footage the amount of housing contribution is then assessed by unit or square footage gain there is one exception which is detailed in subsection d of this section 3 only the bonus increments are assessed a contribution b bonus measure units 1 where available additional units may be created by density bonus in the rm20 rh and rmh20 districts additional units may be created by density height or parking in the cpud see subsection e of this section 2 how assessed contribution is assessed on the additional units possible of the bonus the amount of contribution per unit will vary according to the project location as per table iv c bonus measure square footage 1 generally bonuses of height lot coverage setback waiver cn uses and parking reductions are translated into additional square footage gained for a structure by the use of these bonuses as detailed in this subsection 2 height a where available in cg cpud ipud rpud districts b how assessed the available stories allowed by the bonus are translated into the additional square footage gained c bonus square footage is then assessed according to table iv 3 lot coverage a where available ig and il districts b how assessed that building square footage which exceeds the amount permitted under the base lot coverage requirements is assessed c example a base 45 percent lot coverage on a certain lot allows a 15000 square foot building using the bonus of increased lot coverage a 20000 square foot building is constructed the additional 5000 square feet are then used to assess contribution 4 setback waiver a where available ig and il districts b one side setback may be waived allowing for zero lot line construction not streetside c how assessed that portion of the building which encroaches into the setback is assessed in terms of the square footage which is in the base setback 5 cn uses in industrial districts a where available ig and il districts b how assessed 1 neighborhood commercial use except as residential permitted as subordinate use in an industrial building 2 industrial use must comprise 75 percent or more of the building 3 assessed by amount of square footage devoted to cn use 6 parking reduction in number of spaces a available in 1 rm20 rmh20 cg cpud reduction up to 20 percent 2 ig il ipud no limit on reduction b how assessed 1 assumption is made that a reduction in the number of spaces creates additional buildable area and thus results in a larger structure 2 the square footage of the building gained by the reduction in spaces is then assessed c example 1 a developer desires to build a 10000 square foot building which would require 50 parking spaces 2 the developer can only supply 40 spaces 20 percent less than requirement 3 under base requirements 40 spaces would allow 8000 square feet 4 the developer is able to construct 2000 additional square feet based on bonus 5 this 2000 bonus square feet of building is assessed as per table iv d to utilize parking spaces reduction a developer shall demonstrate the following 1 parking requirements are excessive and require substantially more spaces than are needed as demonstrated by actual usage etc  or 2 alternative means of transportation are to be provided such as park and ride shuttle buses etc e failure to accommodate parking demand on site or by alternative methods may result in revocation of the permit to occupy the building 7 parking  allowance for compact spaces a where available rm20 rmh20 cg il ig ipud and cpud districts b compact parking stall shall measure eight feet by 16 feet c how assessed as use of this bonus by decreasing parking area and increasing buildable area results in a larger structure additional building square footage created shall be assessed accordingly d parking reduction if reduction in number or size of spaces is unrelated to an increase in size an assessment shall be made based on either 1 number of spaces reduced at $25000 for each space eliminated  or 2 number of compact provided at $15000 for compact space e cpud  special case 1 bonuses in the cpud are translated into units or square footage gains as in the above district 2 however due to the more complex nature of a cpud involving multiple uses the means of assessment are summarized below a if use of the bonus regarding height density or parking reduction results in additional residential units the unit measurement is used  ie for each bonus condo unit created one affordable unit or 7500 square feet are required b for bonuses relating to nonresidential uses the gain is translated into square feet in cg and the contribution is assessed per square foot at the rate in table iv c special case height in cases where the building contains mixed uses the bonus square footage shall be assessed at the least restrictive ratio d use of the parking bonus for residential uses shall not be assessed a contribution if a contribution has been received in the density category f bonuscontribution ratio _____ table iv bonuscontribution ratio minority employment

the value of cpud and ipud projects to downtown revitalization andor the general economy of the city the city council shall have the authority to waive in part portions of the contribution amounts based upon the following 1 demonstration that the project will result in the creation of a significant number of permanent jobs for city residents 2 demonstration that the magnitude of the project is such that satisfying the total contribution based on cumulative assessments would render the project infeasible 3 longrange economic benefits to the city and downtown are substantial and should be considered in lieu of stated contributions in this chapter b a developer of an ipud choosing to construct affordable units may place those units within the ipud and further may construct additional housing units within the ipud not to exceed 25 percent of the area c administrative guidelines shall be established and adopted by city council 1 all bonus requests shall be approved by city council in accordance with the plan and guidelines 2 guidelines shall include but are not limited to a review procedures to be followed b staff personnel responsibilities c monitoring and enforcement d means to ensure mix of affordable homes across income range and by housing type e guidelines as necessary to implement the goals of this chapter  7906 role of singlefamily and medium density multiplefamily districts a it is anticipated that the affordable units produced by the developer or housing trust fund would be located in the rm15 multiple family rd15 duplex or rs8 singlefamily districts under the plan bonuses are not given in these singlefamily or multiplefamily districts examination of existing zoning standards for the districts indicates 1 existing standards are set at a minimum level already which allow the development of affordable housing a for example 800 square feet minimum for a house could not be categorized as an excessive requirement b minimum lot size for singlefamily is lower than in the county 2 review of those communities which were able to offer costreducing incentives revealed that the codes contained requirements for enclosed garages and minimum number of bedrooms the city not contain these types of excessive standards b the types of bonuses given in the high density residential and commercial districts would not contribute to creating quality low density residential housing allowing increased densities in the rm15 district would generally result in overcrowded sites without adequate play area for children and privacy for occupants c the districts are best served by being the recipients of the units added housing contribution process in keeping with existing standards d those who choose to build affordable housing in the districts will be able to take advantage of the programs offered housing trust fund to help with the costs of construction rental home ownership etc  7906 appendices the appendices to the minority employment

downtown main street and the street design of this thoroughfare is critical to the overall revitalization of the downtown area the first phase of improvement of this corridor entails installing a central median with regularly spaced trees as well as new street trees in grates on either side as redevelopment occurs the building setbacks will allow the face of curb to be moved back to provide an onstreet parking lane as shown on the right side of the diagram onstreet parking calms traffic provides easy access to local businesses and shields the pedestrian area from moving traffic shade trees are installed in grates and the adjacent building setbacks augment the sidewalk area to establish a superior pedestrian environment at the time parking is installed the trees will also be moved or

design has dedicated bicycle lanes onstreet parking and wide sidewalks shaded by street trees planted in grates to implement this design the rightofway which is generally 50 feet or 60 feet wide will

public benefit height 2 multiply the result by the public benefit factor from table figure 31538a that best describes the configuration of the proposed civic open space 3 the result is the total additional building square footage that can be placed within in the extra stories allowed by the district as the maximum public benefit height subject to floorplate limitations in the massing regulations for example within the downtown core district a project that proposes a civic open space of 2000 square feet in size adjoining two streets and not located on the waterfront would compute the benefit as follows 2000 square feet  4 stories  2   16000 square feet therefore 16000 square feet could be arranged within the fifth stories subject to floorplate limitations 4 the additional building square footage garnered by using the public benefit height option is not included in the calculation of or limitation of maximum floor area ratio exh a 121813 downtown parking and access a

3169331710  reserved article x  concurrency management and public facility capacity adequacy of public facilities and services public facilities and services shall be determined to be adequate to serve the needs of a proposed development when traffic circulation recreation drainage and flood protection potable water solid waste and sanitary sewer public facilities and services will be available to meet established levelofservice standards consistent with fs ch 163 and the concurrency management provisions of this  5191 level of service standards a generally new development shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available design capacity to sustain the following levels of service as established in the city comprehensive plan b streets 1 level of service c peak hour and daily on all arterials collectors and local streets except on broadway old dixie highway and blue heron boulevard which are d 2 interstate 95 shall be designated a backlogged facility under a maintain service standard until such time as it is improved and will operate under a los d standard  this means during the interim traffic volumes shall be maintained within 110 percent of the 1989 level c sanitary sewer the city collection and treatment system shall accommodate an average daily flow of at least 135 gallons per person per day d drainage all new development shall detain onsite the first inch of runoff or runoff from a onehour storm that statistically occurs once in three years whichever is greater  all ground floor elevations shall be above the 100year storm elevations the drainage system of new developments shall also be designed to comply with the water quantity and quality requirements of the appropriate permitting agency but postdevelopment runoff shall not exceed predevelopment runoff e water the city water system shall provide 177 gallons per person per day at sufficient pressure to meet fire flow demands as determined by the fire chief  a storage capacity of at least 4300000 shall be maintained f solid waste city trucks and the county disposal system shall be able to accommodate six pounds per capita per day g recreation at least three acres of neighborhood and community public recreation land per 1000 population are required  5191 concurrency review procedures a development subject to adequacy determination of the florida administrative that no development permit as defined in fs   shall be issued if it would cause a reduction in an adopted level of service the concurrency management system application of this is as follows 1 new development a concurrency certification levelofservice standard compliance will be finally calculated and the facility capacity reserved at the time of approval of a site plan singlefamily subdivision plat enforceable developers agreement or if none of the above apply building permit this is in conformance with 9j of the florida administrative requires a specific plan for development including densities and intensities of development see also subsection 3 of this section for exemptions to the above b courtesy concurrency determination the city or the applicant may request a preliminary concurrency review at an earlier development permit stage including rezonings other types of subdivisions special exceptions or variances such a review may also be requested for future land use map amendments or annexations this review does not guarantee capacity reservation 2 addition or change of use any building addition or a basic change of building use which increases public facility usage shall be subject to concurrency review only the incremental increase in facility capacity usage over the existing usage will be assessed for concurrency 3 property which is exempt a dri development which is authorized by a development of regional impact dri development order approved prior to adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived b vested projects the criteria for determining whether a previously approved project is exempt from this article is as follows if a site plan was approved after  and a building permit based upon that site plan is obtained by  if a site plan is not required then concurrency must be met at the time of building permit application if such application is submitted after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived unless otherwise exempt see subsection 4 of this section for vesting appeal process c houses development which is one singlefamily or duplex dwelling on a lot in single and separate ownership from adjacent lots d building use change any change of building use which clearly causes no increase in public facility usage due to the similarities of the uses or a reduction in all facility usages  however any increase in required parking shall require a concurrency review e public uses development which is a government facility which the city council finds is essential to the health or safety of the city residents 4 appeal process any applicant that is aggrieved by a decision of the director relative to vesting based upon expenditures made in reliance upon the existing code or other decision relative to whether or not a project is subject to concurrency review may appeal to the city council b measurement of levelofservice capacities 1 water and wastewater measurement of the capacity of water and wastewater treatmentstorage facilities will be based on current design capacities project flows may be based upon the generation rates in tables ii and iii alternative methods or sources may be used but they must be acceptable to the director of utilities or city engineer 2 roadways the standard for measuring highway capacities shall be the state department of transportation table of generalized daily levelofservice maximum volumes the measurement of capacity may also be determined by engineering studies or other data provided that analysis techniques are technically sound and acceptable to the city engineer traffic generation shall be based upon the rates contained in county road impact fee ordinance which provides the basis for table i or the institute of transportation engineers ite manual the impact shall be presumed to be limited to the collector or arterial serving the local street giving access to the lot or to the collector or arterial giving direct access to the lot c traffic capacity review procedures traffic capacity review procedures shall be as follows 1 projects generating less than 500 additional trips if a development permit subject to concurrency review is for a project that generates less than 500 additional net trips per day no county review is required capacity review will be performed by the city the following steps shall be followed a traffic study the applicant shall submit a traffic study by a professional engineer unless the project is exclusively residential with 50 or fewer units in minor projects a traffic impact statement may be sufficient as determined by the city engineer b engineering review the city engineer shall review the traffic statement or study to determine level of service compliance 2 projects generating more than 500 additional trips county review is required if the project will add more than 500 net trips per day to the county andor state system of collector and arterial streets conformance to the county traffic performance ordinances shall be demonstrated  and any amendments thereto the only exemptions from this subsection are if the project received a sitespecific formal development permit prior to  or in some other way is determined to be vested by the city attorney specifically the following steps shall be followed  see the county ordinances for detailed procedures a traffic study the applicant shall submit a traffic study by a professional traffic engineer unless the project is exclusively residential with 50 or fewer units b engineer review the city engineer shall review the traffic study to determine conformance with county or request the county engineer to perform such a review in the former case the city engineer shall submit his review to the county engineer  the county engineer shall have 30 days to review the city engineers report see county for appeal procedures and required city procedures relative to previous approvals d determination of concurrency 1 capacity availability calculation for purposes of this section the capacity availability shall be determined by adding together a the total design capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service  and b the total design capacity of new facilities that will become available concurrent with the impact of the development must meet requirements in subsection 2 of this section then subtracting from that number the sum of c the design demand for the service created by existing development  and d the new design demand for the service by phase or otherwise that will be created concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development by the anticipated completion of other presently approved developments 2 requirements for applicability of new facilities the capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown a for water sewer solid waste and drainage 1 the necessary facilities are in place at the time a site plan or plat approval is issued  2 such approval is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities will be in place when the impacts of development occur  3 construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of site plan or plat approval  or 4 the new facilities are guaranteed at a specific time in an enforceable development agreement an enforceable development agreement may include but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to fs   or an agreement or development order pursuant to fs ch 380 b for recreation 1 subsections a1a3 of this subsection  2 the new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of facilities to be completed within one year of the time the development permit is issued  or 3 a development agreement whereby construction begins within one year c for traffic 1 the new facilities have been included in a financially feasible fiveyear capital improvement program and construction is scheduled for the third year or earlier  or 2 subsections b1b3 of this subsection e burden of showing compliance on applicant the burden of showing compliance with these levels of service requirements shall be upon the applicant in order to be approvable applications for development approval shall provide sufficient and verifiable information showing compliance with these standards f concurrency review fee an applicant will be charged a concurrency review fee of $25000 this fee will be used to defray the cost of the determination of concurrency  5191 concurrency monitoring system a responsibility the planning director shall be responsible for monitoring development activity to ensure that when concurrency reviews are made data on all existing and committed development and its impact on facilities subject to levelofservice standards has been recorded monitoring shall include periodic entry of building permit demolition and certificate of occupancy data b concurrency rights reservation and effective period 1 capacity reservation compliance will be finally calculated and capacity reserved at time of final action of an approved site plan singlefamily subdivision building permit if neither a site plan or singlefamily subdivision is required or enforceable developers agreement applications for these development permits shall be chronologically logged upon approval to determine rights to available capacity 2 reservation period a building permit application must be submitted within 18 months of site plan approval to preserve the concurrency reservation an extension of six months may be issued by the city council 3 developer agreement developer agreements as described in fs   et seq shall have a valid concurrency period not to exceed five years this concurrency period may be extended
