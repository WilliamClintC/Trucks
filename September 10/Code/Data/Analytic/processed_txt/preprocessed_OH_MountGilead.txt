council preliminary unit editors note the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10 this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the adopting ordinancewhich enacts the codified ordinances the comparative is included

to buildings that do not conform to the general restrictions applicable to their location 3there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property involved or to the intended use or development of the property that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same zoning district or neighborhood that cannot be solved by some manner other than the granting of a variance 4the granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the locality or substantially impair environmental quality property values or public safety or welfare in the vicinity 5a variance is necessary for the applicant to enjoy a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and does not confer a special privilege ordinarily denied to other properties in the district 6the grant of a variance is necessary not because it will increase the applicants economic return although it may have this effect but because without a variance the applicant will be deprived of beneficial use or enjoyment of or reasonable economic return from the property bexceptions to permitted uses an exception to a permitted use may be

conversion systems to promote the health safety and general welfare of the residents of the village it is also intended to minimize any adverse visual audio or acoustical safety issues of a wind energy conversion system it is designed to establish the public processes needed to identify preferred locations for wind turbines and create a clear permit process passed 41910 116503 findings awind energy is a potential renewable and nonpolluting energy resource of the village and its conversion to electricity may reduce dependence on nonrenewable conventional energy sources and decrease the pollution that results therefrom however wind energy facilities should be sited in a way that protect the health and safety needs of the residents living near a large wind turbine bthe regulation of the siting and installation of a large wind energy turbine system is necessary to protect the health safety and welfare of the residents of the village and the general public adverse health and safety issues are likely to arise if appropriate standards and setbacks are not followed in the siting and installation of large wind turbines cover 500 wind turbine accidents have occurred involving ice throws blade disintegration fire and tower failure in the world since 1999 dheavy equipment used for the construction of large wind turbines can damage local roads e1large wind turbines are significant sources of noise which if improperly sited can negatively impact the health of residents particularly in areas of low ambient noise levels large wind turbines emit two types of noise a aerodynamic noise from the blades passing air  and b mechanical noise from the interaction of the turbine components noise is an annoyance that can negatively impact health producing negative effects such as sleep disturbance and deprivation stress anxiety headaches depression pain and stiffness decreased cognitive ability tinnitus hypertension and fatigue while some people are unaffected by wind turbine noise others may develop adverse health effects from the same noise at low frequencies wind turbine noise may not be heard but rather felt as a vibration 2few people are disturbed in their sleep with noise that is measured at less than 35 dba however some are disturbed by a change in as little as 5 db over the original noise level studies show that prolonged exposure to wind turbine noise results in adverse health effects at noise levels lower than ordinary noise created by traffic urban industrial or commercial noise living in a rural environment in comparison with a suburban area increases the risk of residents being impacted by noise from nearby large wind turbines because of the low ambient noise in the rural area the international standards organization recommended community noise limits for rural area be set at a spl of 35 dba during the day 30 dba during the evening hours and 25 dba at night audible sound limits should be limited to 20 dba above the ambient level with an absolute maximum level of 3540 dba 3because ohio rc 490620 contains no maximum noise level set as a standard for a wind turbine system the village will set its own maximum noise level at 35 dba fadverse health effects from wind turbine noise can be exacerbated by the rotating blades and shadows from the wind turbines as the wind turbine blades rotate in sunny condition they cast strobe like shadows on the windows of nearby homes and buildings and nearby streets and roads causing shadow flicker that can not be avoided shadow flicker can cause some people to become dizzy nauseated or lose their balance the shadow flicker can produce headaches or even seizures in photosensitive individuals gwind turbines have been known to throw ice and debris from the turbine blades ice throws from large wind turbines can reach distances up to 1750 feet and blade throws can reach 2500 feet passed 41910 116504 definitions the definitions contained herein shall apply only to this chapter aaerodynamic sound a noise that is caused by the flow of air over and past the blades of a wind energy conversion system bambient sound this encompasses all sounds present in a given environment such as farm or construction noise a car traveling on a nearby roadway insects and birds and people having conversation canemometer a device for measuring the speed and direction of the wind dapplicant the individual or business entity that seeks to secure a license under this chapter ebackground sound this refers to the sounds that would normally be present at least 90% of the time background sounds are those heard during lulls in the ambient sound environment the background sound levels vary during different times of the day and night because a wind energy conversion system operates 24 hours a day seven days a week the background sound levels of interest are those during the quieter periods which are often the evening and night sounds from birds insects and people must be eliminated from background sound tests fclear area the area surrounding a wind turbine that is free of any residential or commercial structures gdba the sound pressure level in decibels refers to the a weighted scale as defined by ansi american national standards institute hflicker the effect of moving periodic shadows cast on a residence or place of business by the rotating blades of a wind
