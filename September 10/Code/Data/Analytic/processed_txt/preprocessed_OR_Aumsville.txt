shall include at a minimum all siteaccess points and intersections signalized and unsignalized adjacent to the proposed site if the proposed site fronts an arterial or collector street  the study shall include all intersections along the site frontage and within the access spacing distances extending out from the boundary of the site frontage beyond the minimum study area the tia shall evaluate all intersections that receive sitegenerated trips that comprise at least 10% or more of the total intersection volume in addition to these requirements the city engineer or hisher designee shall determine any additional intersections or roadway links that might be adversely affected as a result of the proposed development the applicant and the city engineer or hisher designee will agree on these intersections prior to the start of the tia 2 study years to be analyzed in the transportation impact analysis a levelofservice analysis shall be performed for all study roadways and intersections for the following horizon years 142 a existing year evaluate all existing study roadways and intersections under existing conditions b background year evaluate the study roadways and intersections in the year the proposed land use is expected to be fully built out without traffic from the proposed land use this analysis should include traffic from all approved developments that impact the study intersections or planned developments that are expected to be fully built out in the horizon year c horizon year the horizon year of a tia is the most distance future year that shall be considered in the tia the horizon year will be a specified number of years after the development opens and this number will vary depending on the size of the development any land use plan changes necessary to allow it its uses and the anticipated time until full buildout the following table shows the tia horizon year expressed in years after the development is planned to open for developments expected to generate less than 5% truck traffic development typetrip generation per day horizon year any zone change 20 years other development less than 1000 0 years other development 1000 to 1999 5 years other development 2000 to 4999 10 years other development 5000 or more 20 years for developments expected to generate more than 5% truck traffic consult city staff for the tia horizon year city staff may at their discretion reduce the horizon year in cases where less future study is necessary d evaluate the expected roadway intersection and land use conditions resulting from the background growth and the proposed land use action assuming full buildout and occupancy for phased developments an analysis shall be performed during each year a phase is expected to be completed e twentyyear analysis for all land use actions requesting a comprehensive plan amendment andor a zone change or that are expected to generate more than 5000 daily trips a longterm levelofservice analysis shall be performed for all study intersections assuming buildout of the proposed site with and without the comprehensive plan designation andor zoning designation or proposed development in place the analysis should be performed using the future year traffic volumes identified in the transportation system plan tsp if the applicants traffic engineer proposes to use different future year traffic volumes justification for not using the tsp volumes must be provided along with documentation of the forecasting methodology 3 study time periods to be analyzed in the transportation impact analysis within each horizon year a levelofservice analysis shall be performed for the time periods that experience the highest degree of network travel these periods typically occur during the midweek tuesday  morning  am to  am midweek evening  pm to  pm and saturday afternoon  pm to  pm periods the tia should 143 always address the weekday am and pm peak hours when the proposed land use action is expected to generate 25 trips or more during the peak time periods if the applicant can demonstrate that the peakhour trip generation of the proposed land use action is negligible during one of the two peak study periods and the peak trip generation of the land use action corresponds to the roadway system peak then only the worstcase study period need be analyzed depending on the proposed land use action and the expected tripgenerating characteristics of that development consideration of nonpeak travel periods may be appropriate examples of land uses that have nontypical trip generating characteristics include schools movie theaters and churches the city engineer or hisher designee and applicant should discuss the potential for additional study periods prior to the start of the tia 4 traffic count requirements once the study periods have been determined turning movement counts should be collected at all study area intersections to determine the base traffic conditions these turning movement counts should typically be conducted during the time periods that experience the highest degree of network travel as identified in 3 above depending on the proposed land use historical turning movement counts may be used if the data are less than 12 months old but must be factored to meet the existing traffic conditions 5 trip generation for the proposed development to determine the impacts of a proposed development on the surrounding transportation network the tripgenerating characteristics of that development must be estimated tripgenerating characteristics should be obtained from one of the following acceptable sources a institute of transportation engineers ite trip generation manual latest edition b specific trip generation studies that have been conducted for the particular land use action for the purposes of estimating peakhour tripgenerating characteristics the city engineer or hisher designee should approve the use of these studies prior to their inclusion in the tia c in addition to new sitegenerated trips several land uses typically generate additional trips that are not added to the adjacent traffic network these trips include passby trips and internal trips and are considered to be separate from the total number of new trips generated by the proposed development the procedures listed in the most recent version of the trip generation handbook ite should be used to account for passby and internal trips 6 trip distribution estimated sitegenerated traffic from the proposed development should be distributed and assigned on the existing or proposed arterialcollector street network trip distribution methods should be based on a reasonable assumption of local travel patterns and the locations of offsite origindestination points within the site vicinity acceptable trip distribution methods should be based on one of the following procedures a an analysis of local traffic patterns and intersection turning movement counts gathered within the previous 12 months 144 b a detailed market study specific to the proposed development and surrounding land uses 7 intersection operation standards the city of aumsville evaluates the intersection operational performance of cityowned intersections based on levels of service standards it should be noted that the oregon department of transportation odot and marion county have their own operations performance standards that apply to their facilities the odot roadways operational performance is measured with volumetocapacity analysis and marion countys roadways operational performance is measured with volumeto capacity analysis and level of service standards intersection operational performance standards for all road authorities within the city of aumsville are as found in when evaluating the volumetocapacity ratio the total traffic demand shall be considered a a capacity analysis should be performed at all intersections within the identified study area b the city of aumsville requires all intersections within the study area to maintain an acceptable level of operations per upon full buildout of the proposed land use action calculations should be made using the methods identified in the most recent version of the highway capacity manual or by field studies published by the transportation research board any intersections not operating at standards described in will be considered to be unacceptable c all signalized intersection and all waystop controlled intersections shall operate at a level of service d or better all individual movements shall operate at los e or better other unsignalized intersections including unsignalized private access shall operate at a level of service d or better although los f may be allowed if the movement has a relatively low volume as determined by city staff and there is no indication that a safety problem will be created intersections at state highways shall also meet the standards of the oregon department of transportation 8 recommendations and conclusions provide descriptions and analysis of the appropriate conclusions mitigation measures and recommended improvements necessary for compliance with the applicable standards include analysis showing that these measures will bring identified intersections and locations into compliance and include signal turn lane or other warrant analyses as appropriate the tia shall also specify the timing and phasing of any new traffic signals and the length of any new turn lanes any new parking facility needs shall be identified and the conformance of the proposed parking facilities to applicable standards any new pedestrian and bicycle transportation needs arising from the development shall also be identified any and all mitigation measures recommended in the tia shall be physically and economically feasible and this feasibility may need to be demonstrated in questionable cases in addition the recommendations and conclusions presented in the tia shall be consistent with and supported by the data calculations and analysis in the report inconsistent andor unsupported conclusions will not be accepted and may lead to the tia being returned to the applicants traffic engineer for correction 145 f review policy and procedure the following criteria should be used in reviewing a tia as part of a subdivision or site development

promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city of aumsville does ordain the following findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of city of aumsville are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored cause damage in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to flood loss 2502 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote public health safety and general welfare and to minimize
