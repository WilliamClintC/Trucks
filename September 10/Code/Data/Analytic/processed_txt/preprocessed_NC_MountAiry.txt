procedure a subdivision plat review is a four stage review process as an initial step a developer shall prepare an informal sketch plan and have it reviewed by the technical review committee which consists of senior staff members with expertise in this area the purpose of this informal process is not to approve any plats but to provide an opportunity to exchange information between the developer and the city b the formal review process begins with the preliminary plat a plat shall be submitted in accordance with specific development standards as listed in sections 1450 dealing with improvements required and minimum standards of design initially the plat is reviewed by the technical review committee to determine whether or not it complies with the requirements of this chapter once the technical review committee is satisfied the plat shall be submitted to the planning board after reviewing the comments from the technical review committee the planning board shall approve approve conditionally or disapprove the plat c once the preliminary plat has been approved the subdivider may begin constructing the subdivision prior to any development all constructions plans shall be approved by the city d within 12 months after approval of the preliminary plat by the planning board the subdivider shall submit a final plat showing that such subdivider has completed the subdivision according to the preliminary plat the final plat shall be reviewed by the technical review committee and approved by the board of commissioners only after the final plat has been approved by the board of commissioners and recorded at the surry county register of deeds office may lots be sold the plat must be recorded within 30 days after approval by the governing body e in order to expedite the review process minor subdivisions as defined in section 1431 may complete an abbreviated review procedure as in the full review process the technical review committee shall review informally the project to insure compliance with the general development goals of the community instead of then submitting a preliminary plat for review and approval the subdivider submits only the

commissioners art ii  1 sketch design plan review a as stated earlier the sketch plan review is an informal process that allows an exchange of information between the developer and the city staff

airy north carolina and its area of extraterritorial jurisdiction is hereby divided into the following primary use districts residential district the r20 residential district is established as a district in which the principal use of the land is for low density residential or agricultural uses the r20 district also permits associated public and private facilities typically associated with such districts singlefamily residential district the r15 singlefamily residential district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for medium density singlefamily residential uses and associated public and private facilities typically associated with such districts singlefamily residential district the r8 residential district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for singlefamily residential purposes the regulations of this district are intended to provide areas for those persons desiring singlefamily residences general residential district the r6 residential district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is for singlefamily twofamily and multifamily residences the regulations of this district are intended to provide areas in the community for those persons desiring small residences and multifamily structures in relatively high density neighborhoods residential and office district the r4 residential and office district is established to provide for the high density residential office governmental and institutional needs of the community it functions as a transitional land use between intensive commercial and industrial uses and residential development the district is also designed to encourage compatible uses along major thoroughfares adjacent to residential neighborhoods central business district this district is the central shopping area of the city of mount airy and its surrounding commercial trade area the regulations of this district are designed to encourage the continued use of land for community trade and commercial service uses and to promote a concentrated development of permitted uses while maintaining a substantial relationship between the intensity of land uses and the capacity of utilities and streets general business district this district provides a location for those businesses and services which generally serve a wider area than the neighborhood business but do not necessarily require location in the central business district because these commercial uses are important to the economy of the area and are subject to public view they should have ample parking controlled traffic movement and suitable site design neighborhood business district the b3 neighborhood business district is intended for the use of those businesses which are properly and necessarily located near residential areas and which cater to the everyday needs of a residential neighborhood highway business district the b4 highway business districts are generally located on major thoroughfares and collector streets in the mount airy planning area because these business areas are subject to the public view they should provide an appropriate appearance ample parking and be designed to minimize traffic congestion medical business district the regulations for this district are designed to permit concentrated development of business and professional office facilities within the jurisdiction and to encourage development that is compatible with nearby residential areas that is not hazardous to safe vehicular and pedestrian traffic industrial district the m1 industrial district is established for those areas of the community where the principal use of land is for industrial and warehousing uses these uses by their nature may create some nuisance and are not properly associated with residential commercial or service establishments these uses normally seek outlying locations on large tracts of land where the operations involved do not detract from the development potential of nearby undeveloped properties conditional districts established  purposes set forth there is also established a conditional district cd which corresponds to each of the districts authorized by this follows r20  cd r6  cd b2  cd b5  cd r15  cd r4  cd b3  cd m1  cd r8  cd b1  cd b4  cd the purpose of the conditional district rezoning process is to provide a procedure for considering the rezoning of property based upon the recognition that certain types of zoning would be inappropriate at particular locations in the absence of special conditions because of the refinement of this option the city strongly encourages its use for such situations conditional district zoning affords a degree of certainty when making land use decisions that are not possible when rezoning to a general zoning district which allows the full range of uses permitted in the district and does not provide the flexibility to propose or require binding site specific conditions to address unique issues that affect the subject property or any potential adverse impacts on adjacent property  editors note adopted  amended  42 in its entirety to read as herein set out former  42 pertained to conditional use districts established  purposes set forth overlay districts established  purposes set forth the primary zoning districts established in the conditional districts established in may also be subject to the additional requirements of one or more overlay district as established herein damage prevention overlay district the flood hazard areas of the jurisdiction are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and government services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated flood proofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages it is the purpose of this overlay district to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands the flood damage prevention overlay district is established as the floodway and floodway fringe areas of the various water courses within the jurisdiction as identified by the federal emergency management agency on its latest flood maps with accompanying supporting data which are hereby adopted by reference supply watershed protection overlay district the water supply watershed protection overlay districts are intended to help preserve and maintain the citys outstanding water resources they are established to protect those portions of designated water supply watersheds which lie closest to existing and proposed water supply intakes from activities which could degrade water quality  to reduce the amount of sediment washing into streams  to encourage a low intensity of land development in the most sensitive portions of the watershed  to reduce the risk to water quality posed by high density residential and nonresidential developments  and for the purpose of protecting and promoting public health safety and the general welfare of the jurisdiction the following watershed protection overlay district classifications are established and are shown
