landfills  water supply watershed protection district a purpose in order to provide for the health safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured the ability of natural systems to filter storm water runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs in addition storm water runoff particularly from impervious surfaces can introduce toxins nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation industrial land uses that involve the manufacture use transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies the purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city  to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply  and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed this article shall apply to all existing and proposed water supply watersheds within the city b establishment of water supply

hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods which are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise
