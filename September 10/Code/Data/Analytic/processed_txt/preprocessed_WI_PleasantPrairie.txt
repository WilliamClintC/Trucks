and results such operations when conducted in a rapidly developing and urbanizing community such as the village and its environs can constitute offensive industry produce nuisance conditions adversely affect the public health safety prosperity and general welfare and otherwise result in a deterioration of the quality of life and aesthetically pleasing surroundings that are important to the continued growth development and prosperity of the village unless such operations are rigorously regulated and controlled in addition to the obvious safety hazards associated with blasting and the potential physical injury and damage that can result from flyrock ground vibration airblast noise and dust produced by blasting operations such operations can also result in unreasonable annoyance and serious indirect impacts on neighboring properties and the community as a whole such as diminution of property values resultant property tax loss and the shifting of development patterns so as to be at odds with longrange land use planning if not prevented or controlled such adverse effects of blasting operations can far outweigh the beneficial aspects of such operations  1323 purpose the purpose

authority granted by the wisconsin statutes including without limitation   and 61341 wis stats it is intended in the event that any of these sources of authority is abrogated or limited by future enactments of the state legislature that this chapter shall be based upon and construed in light of all other then available authorities  2702 findings the village board finds that while quarries and other nonmetallic mining operations produce socially beneficial products and add incrementally to the economic wellbeing of the community such operations when conducted in a rapidly developing and urbanizing community such as the village and its environs constitute offensive industry produce nuisance conditions adversely affect the public health safety prosperity and general welfare and otherwise result in a deterioration of the quality of life and aesthetically pleasing surroundings that are important to the continued growth development and prosperity of the village unless such operations and the reclamation of the site of such operations are rigorously regulated and controlled in addition to the potential direct impacts of noise dust ground vibration airblast fly rock heavy truck traffic groundwater drawdown erosion pollution of surface and groundwater and attractive nuisance conditions that result from quarry and other nonmetallic mining operations such operations also result in serious indirect impacts on neighboring properties and the community as a whole such as diminution of property values and resultant property tax loss damage to infrastructure such as streets and highways the shifting of development patterns so as to be at odds with longrange land use planning and the resultant inability to recapture in a fair and equitable manner infrastructure investments made in reliance upon such planning and large areas of land left in unproductive aesthetically displeasing and dangerous condition and the attendant loss of future property tax revenue if not prevented or controlled such adverse effects can far outweigh the beneficial aspects of quarries and other nonmetallic mining operations  2703 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to regulate and control all quarry and other nonmetallic mining operations and as a part of such regulation to require regulate and control the reclamation of all quarry and other nonmetallic mining sites  2701

references land division and development control  see ch 395 zoning see ch 420  4101 purpose and intent it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to provide for the implementation and use of digital security imaging systems hereinafter referred to as dsis that monitor the exterior spaces and areas of certain commercial retail establishments and retail developments in the village of pleasant prairie the dsis will afford the opportunity for public safety departments eg village police department and village fire & rescue department to visually examine certain retail establishments and retail development sites and will provide emergency response personnel with a visual assessment of an emergency situation in advance of arrival without placing an undue burden for services on the taxpayers the advanced visual assessment may pertain to a person or persons personal identification a location scene identification andor a situation action identification in emergency situations the implementation and usage of dsis will facilitate law enforcement agencies in crime investigation while it is anticipated that the implementation and usage of dsis will greatly aid law enforcement agencies in subsequent criminal investigations and prosecutions it is recognized that dsis alone cannot provide for or be solely relied upon to produce positive personal action or scene identification furthermore it is recognized that since there is no village requirement that these systems be actively monitored it cannot be reasonably expected that these systems will on their own necessarily provide a safer or more secure environment nor are they a substitute for other security measures it is also the intent of this chapter to attain commercial retail environments of sustained desirability and economic stability and to avoid unreasonable adverse effects to the property values of the surrounding properties and surrounding neighborhoods and to maintain and promote the public

establish that the expansion will not worsen an existing deficiency of the property or neighborhood nor prevent the eventual solution of such deficiencies as experience with this problem is gained the village may from time to time issue checklists or guidelines for the applicants use which outline information or analyses required to answer the issues often posed in such reviews an applicant under this provision shall be entitled to an acceptance rejection or suggested modification of the submitted site plan or related information within 45 days from the date of submittal to the community development department the aforesaid review may be waived by the zoning administrator of the community development department if it is determined that the proposed expansion or addition of the

development could legally occur but where typical urban municipal services such as municipal sanitary sewer municipal water and effective stormwater management  420135 vehicles allterrain  420136  improvements are not available and will not be available in the foreseeable future b limited urban services available 1 properties within this district are not located within the village of pleasant prairie master sanitary sewer system master plan which means that the village has no plans in the foreseeable future to extend municipal sanitary sewer to service these properties and that these properties if developed will require a private onsite sewage disposal system or holding tank in addition the state of wisconsin department of natural resources has not included the properties within this district in the sanitary sewer service area which means that the village cannot extend sanitary sewers within this area 2 properties within this district are not located within the village of pleasant prairie master water utility system master plan which means that the village has no plans in the foreseeable future to extend municipal water to service these properties and that if developed these properties will required a private well to be installed for potable water in addition since there is no municipal water service no municipal fire hydrants are located in the area and water for fire protection must be hauled by tanker 3 properties within this district are known to have high groundwater levels which are influenced both by lake michigan water levels and weather conditions 4 properties in this district are frequently subject to standing surface water in part because this area is not served by urban stormwater systems that can effectively and efficiently convey stormwater and this situation may be exacerbated by further development such stormwater improvements would be very difficult or impossible to provide due to the high groundwater table the generally level topography which precludes efficient drainage the fact that any improvements would require a permit under ch 30 wis stats from the wisconsin department of natural resources and the fact that the dnr has expressed serious concern that any such improvements would dewater the wetlands in the area 5 properties within this district may be located adjacent to a dedicated public road rightofway that is not improved and the village has no plans in the foreseeable future to make such improvements on roads in the area which have not already been improved c principal uses any principal use permitted in

pdd which is unique and sitespecific for the purpose of accommodating facilitating and regulating a particular proposed development and use project no specific criteria are set out here to limit the village boards discretion in creating such districts since the nature of the project characteristics which might give rise to the desirability for a pdd cannot reasonably be foreseen generally however the village board will consider a pdd only if a proposed development and use project is not practicable under the villages traditional zoning districts  involves multiple uses  is unusual large and complex  and is so substantially in the public interest as to justify extraordinary efforts to accommodate facilitate and regulate it because the creation of a pdd requires an enormous commitment of resources by the village no person shall have any right to a pdd classification under any circumstances and no person shall have any right to a public hearing on a proposed ordinance to create a pdd unless such hearing is specifically approved by the village board after a detailed report on the proposed pdd from the village staff since a pdd cannot be created by the village board unilaterally and must be consented to by the affected landowners and since the drafting of a proposed pdd ordinance is necessarily a difficult timeconsuming and cooperative effort and since the creation of a pdd will usually require the negotiation and drafting of a companion development agreement relating to the public and private infrastructure that is required to serve the proposed development and uses the preparation of a proposed pdd ordinance will generally involve extensive closeddoor discussions and negotiations between members of the village staff and the village attorneys and representatives of the owners and developers of the land covered by the proposed pdd the purpose of such discussions and negotiations shall not be to commit the village board in any way to the proposed ordinance but rather to mutually explore the needs and desires of the owners and developers and the requirements policies and practices of the village to attempt to structure a proposed ordinance that both the village staff and the owners and developers can support to identify potential problems and issues which should be addressed at a public hearing and to attempt to work out potential solutions to any such problems or issues so that the proposed pdd regulations and all relevant facts issues and problems can be presented meaningfully and efficiently to the village plan commission the village board
