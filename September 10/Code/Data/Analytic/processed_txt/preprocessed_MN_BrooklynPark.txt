general provisions athis subchapter adopts the flood plain maps applicable to the city and includes three flood plain districts floodway flood fringe and general flood plain    1where floodway and flood fringe districts are delineated on the flood plain maps the standards in  c or d will apply depending on the location of a property 2locations where floodway and flood fringe districts are not delineated on the flood plain maps are considered to fall within the general flood plain district within the general flood plain district the floodway district standards in  c apply unless the floodway boundary is determined according to the process outlined in  e once the floodway boundary is determined the flood fringe district standards in  d may apply outside the floodway blands to which subchapter applies this subchapter applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map or the attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the floodway flood fringe or general flood plain districts 1the floodway flood fringe and general flood plain districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts the standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in this subchapter in case of a conflict the more restrictive standards will apply cinterpretation the boundaries of the zoning districts are determined by scaling distances on the flood insurance rate map 1where a conflict exists between the flood plain limits illustrated on the official zoning map and actual field conditions the flood elevations shall be the governing factor the zoning administrator must interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first national flood insurance program map showing the area within the regulatory flood plain and other available technical data 2persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the planning commission and to submit technical evidence dabrogation and greater restrictions it is not intended by this subchapter to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or other private agreements however where this subchapter imposes greater restrictions the provisions of this subchapter prevail all other ordinances inconsistent with this subchapter are hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only ethis subchapter does not imply that areas outside a flood hazard area will be free from flooding or flood damages this subchapter does not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or
