purpose a this section regulates development in the flood hazard areas of the city of new hope these flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment to the tax base it is the purpose of this section to promote the public health safety and general welfare by minimizing these losses and disruptions b national flood insurance program compliance this section is adopted to comply with the rules and regulations of the national flood insurance program codified as 44 federal regulations parts 5978 as amended so as to maintain the communitys eligibility in the national flood insurance program c this section is also intended to preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts improve water quality reduce soil erosion protect aquatic and riparian habitat provide recreational opportunities provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development b general provisions  1 how to use this section this section adopts the floodplain maps applicable to the city of new hope and includes three floodplain districts floodway flood fringe and general floodplain a where floodway and flood fringe districts are delineated on the floodplain maps the standards in subsections 426d or e will apply depending on the location of a property b locations where floodway and flood fringe districts are not delineated on the floodplain maps are considered to fall within the general floodplain district within the general floodplain district the floodway district standards in section 426d apply unless the floodway boundary is determined according to the process outlined in section 426f once the floodway boundary is determined the flood fringe district standards in section 426e may apply outside the floodway 2 lands to which this section applies this section applies to all lands within the jurisdiction of new hope shown on the official zoning map andor the attachments to the map as being located within the boundaries of the floodway flood fringe or general floodplain districts a the floodway flood fringe and general floodplain districts are overlay districts that are superimposed on all existing zoning districts the standards imposed in the overlay districts are in addition to any other requirements in this section in case of a conflict the more restrictive standards will apply 3 incorporation of maps by reference the following maps together with all attached material are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of the official zoning map

floodplain limits illustrated on the official zoning map and actual field conditions the flood elevations shall be the governing factor the zoning administrator must interpret the boundary location based on the ground elevations that existed on the site on the date of the first national flood insurance program map showing the area within the regulatory floodplain and other available technical data b persons contesting the location of the district boundaries will be given a reasonable opportunity to present their case to the planning commission and to submit technical evidence 5 abrogation

were used it is now necessary and desirable to provide an alternative method of recovering some or all of the future costs of improving maintaining and operating the system imposition of charges as provided in this section c in imposing charges it is necessary to establish a methodology that undertakes to make them just and equitable taking into account the status of completion of the system past methods of recovering system costs the topography of the city and other relevant factors it is determined that it would be just and equitable to assign responsibility for some or all of the future costs of operating maintaining and improving the system on the basis of the expected stormwater runoff from the various parcels of land within the city during a standard oneyear rainfall event

65 456 72 465 85 550 100 648 a higher drainage rate is imposed on commercial and industrial land uses due to greater water pollution from runoff caused by said uses which justify the higher rate 3 residential equivalent factor defined one ref is defined as the ratio of the average volume of runoff generated by one acre of a given land use to the average volume of runoff generated by one acre of typical single family residential land during a standard fiveyear rainfall event it is further assumed that land in new hope is type c soil composed of sandy clay loam and that a fiveyear rainfall event generates 35 inches of rain per hour 4 credits the city council may adopt policies by resolution for adjustment of the stormwater drainage fee for parcels based upon hydrologic data to be

reasonable dispersal of percolating waters which are beyond the ability or the responsibility of the individual property owner to control b abatement of private nuisance soil conditions in the city at times produce percolating water collection or infiltration in and around basements which results in the use of sump pumps to discharge such water outside of and away from the affected buildings

soil to such an extent that it becomes unusable and cannot be maintained as a part of the yard of the owner or occupant of the structure threatens reentry into the house area or unreasonably interferes with the use of adjacent property the artificial rerouting and the accumulation of such diverted percolating waters on the surface of the ground may constitute a private nuisance for the individual owner and possibly the neighbors if such a private nuisance is so great as to make a substantial portion of the private property unusable or impossible to maintain and beyond the capacity of the private owner producing the diverted percolating waters or his neighbor to control  the city will upon petition or application or upon its own initiative consider alternative methods to provide relief and to bring the accumulation of such diverted percolating waters under such reasonable control as it deems necessary and in the public interest c pumping of diverted percolating water onto streets a public nuisance the carrying of surface waters to drainage structures for channeling away from areas where it could cause damage is one of the primary functions of the public streets

renders the property of the owner unsuitable for its intended use  not just inconvenient or a diminished enjoyment but unsuitable for residential use 4 condition permanent the condition is found to be permanent not a temporary phenomenon experienced only in severe wet years or periods sporadic conditions of this nature may be corrected by the city upon request of the owner but at the expense of the owner 5 twenty to 50 gallons per hour discharge rate the anticipated average rate of discharge of diverted percolating waters is in the 20 to 50 gallons per hour range 6 payment if the owner does not

graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property thereby limiting its adverse impact on neighborhoods therefore the city council makes the following findings regarding the need to promptly remove graffiti from private and public property 1 graffiti constitutes a form of vandalism defacing public and private property without the

spiral of blight and decay lessening property values business viability and ultimately tax revenues and as such is inconsistent with the citys property maintenance goals and aesthetic standards 3 there is substantial evidence that prompt eradication of graffiti is an effective prevention strategy which discourages its return while failure to promptly remove graffiti increases the likelihood that more graffiti will occur on the same site and on other nearby property 4 the failure to maintain ones property by removing graffiti which has been declared by the city to constitute a public nuisance within a reasonable period of time is injurious to the public health safety morals and general welfare of the residents of the city b definitions  the following words and terms when used in
