shall conform to provisions of this chapter as required by cdc  and        residential density calculations athe pud allows density to be transferred on residential portions of the site the following sections explain how the allowed number of dwelling units per acre is calculated the standards are also intended to ensure that puds and adjoining developments are compatible and maintain a sense of neighborhood unity bnet acres for land to be developed with detached singlefamily dwellings or multifamily dwellings including duplexes is computed by subtracting the following from the gross acres 1any land area which is included in a boundary street rightofway or water course or planned open space areas if density transfer is not requested 2an allocation of 25 percent for public or private facilities eg streets paths rightofway etc or when a tentative plat or plan has been developed the total land area allocated for public or private facilities 3a lot or parcel of at least the size required by the applicable base zone if an existing dwelling is to remain on the site cthe allowed density or number of dwelling units on the site subject to the limitations in cdc  and  is computed by dividing the number of square feet in the net acres by the minimum number of square feet required for each lot or parcel by the base zone   examples of residential density calculations when density is to be transferred on a land area with type i or type ii land the following procedure will apply  example facts   rightofway    public 59677 sq feet    private 33106 sq feet  213 ac open space

    total allowed density  31 lots  allowable density on type i and ii lands athis table relates to the allowed density of development on type i and ii lands development means when the footprint of a home is placed on type i or ii lands or when over 50 percent of the lot comprises type i or ii lands generally speaking the greater the constraints the lower the density  and the lower the constraints the higher the allowable density please note that density transfers from constrained lands generally allow a 50 to 100 percent transfer the rationale for only a 50 percent transfer is that these lands have historically been of marginal development value eg wetlands 52 percent slopes etc  so to say those lands should have the same 100 percent development value and potential as less constrained lands would be wrong since they are tougher to build on and they are generally appraised at a lower land value than flatter more developable sites there are three categories of allowable density 1 building not allowed  2 allowable density when developed  and 3 allowable density when transferred the first category means that no building is allowed in for example slopes over 50 percent or in wetlands the prohibition is represented by an x the second category means that if a developer wants to develop an area it can only be developed at 50 percent of normal density or not at all the third category when transferred explains what percentage of the normal density of the type i and ii lands can be transferred to onsite non type i and ii lands b    allowable density type i or type ii lands building not allowed when developed when transferred slopes    25  35%  50% 75% 35  50%  x 75% more than 50% x x 50%     confirmed landslide hazards x x 50%     flood management    100year floodplain x x 50% floodway x x 50%     water quality resource area x x 50% significant natural areas x x 50% significant treetree clusters on type i and ii lands x x 50% significant treetree clusters on nontype i and ii lands x x 100% planned public open spaceregional storm treatment facility x x 100% development of singlefamily detached residences on preexisting lots of record is exempt from this chart  most restrictive density governs in the event of conflict or overlap the 50 percent allowable density when developed means that if we reduce the number of homes on constrained lands we reduce the hazard potential which typically increases with higher density and increased site disturbance consequently the density is reduced in half 50 percent that means that to develop on a predominantly steep lot would require twice the minimum lot size of the underlying zone eg you would need a 20000squarefoot lot in the r10 zone when type i and ii lands are to be developed the 70 percent rule shall not apply to those areas  it shall only apply to the developable net area as defined in cdc j7   transitions and limitations on density transfer abecause the pud and the provisions of this chapter allow increased residential densities and various housing types it is necessary that some kind of transition be provided between the project site and the surrounding properties these transitions will for example mitigate the impacts of multifamily housing next to singlefamily housing transitions are not required in all cases however the following exceptions shall apply 1singlefamily pud next to singlefamily nonpud does not require a transition eg even though it is r5 singlefamily next to r10 etc also similar type housing does not need to transition eg duplex next to duplex  2two housing units attached side by side by common wall are considered compatible with detached singlefamily units  but 3more than two attached housing units eg a triplex are not considered compatible with a singlefamily detached unit  however 4where a proposed residential unit is to be located at least 200 feet from the nearest existing singlefamily home the provisions of subsections b1 5 of this section shall not apply the 200foot transition must be on the subject property all parking and access shall be a 20foot minimum setback from abutting property line unless the approval authority based upon the city engineers recommendation approves a circulation plan which supports reduced transition to accommodate joint access between adjoining properties bwhere transitions are required they shall be satisfied by at least one of the following provisions 1an intervening street or driveway that is existing platted or specifically proposed in the transportation master plan and has a minimum width of 24 feet  2natural topography such as a drainageway or wetland that provides adequate horizontal separation minimum 40 feet or a cliff or embankment that provides adequate vertical separation which shall be defined as having the pud site at least 10 feet below the abutting nonpud site plus vegetation for adequate screening the natural topography may be on an adjoining lot or parcel  3manmade berm five feet minimum height with landscaping for adequate screening with a 40foot minimum width this transition must be on the subject lot or parcel  4the onsite lot or parcel sizes for detached singlefamily homes adjacent to each property line shall not be smaller than a lot 75 percent of the minimum size of the lot size allowed on the abutting lots or parcels by the applicable zone or 7000 square feet whichever is less  or 5a horizontal separation of at least 200 feet between on and offsite structures the 200foot transition must be on the subject site   density bonuses aalthough the density may be reduced by cdc  applicants are encouraged to seek density bonus credits under such categories as site planning and design excellence the permitted number of dwelling units may be increased up to 29 percent above those computed under the formula above based on a finding of the planning director that the density bonus credits have been satisfied as set forth in the following section and in cdc  bsite planning and design excellence allow additional units up to the maximum indicated on the chart when excellence in site planning and building design is demonstrated with respect to neighborhood compatibility recreation space security and crime prevention and livability of onsite environment as determined review examples of quality design features which may be used to address the foregoing include but are not limited to 1maximum retention and integration of natural features into site design in addition to open space areas dedicated to the city 2minimize impervious surfaces locate parking facilities and garages at the rear of buildings accessed by alleys deemphasis of the automobile is encouraged of parking at side or rear of buildings reference cdc a2 3maximize recreation and open spaces in addition to open space areas dedicated to the city 4superior landscape plan in terms of quantity of materials and quality represented by size of planttree variety of planttree and mix to allow seasonal colors the landscape plan should incorporate available natural site features eg rock outcroppings creeks etc the landscape plan should relate to or complement onsite buildings frame views and show sensitivity to the microclimate other landscape elements may include rockeries ornamental pools and pathways 5architectural design that emphasizes high quality materials finish texture and craftsmanship architectural complexity and richness of detail are sought contextual design that draws from the predominant architecture of the area is preferred over contrasting design only examples of manifestly outstanding contrasting design would be acceptable alternatives to the contextual approach the design should accommodate the human scale with multiple light windows appropriately scaled entryways and porches facades should be broken up into multiple elements both horizontally and vertically variations in the building silhouette and depth are also desirable 6integration of various housing types and densities supported by neighborhood commercial uses and basic services 7wellarticulated pedestrian and bikeway path system and public transit system if applicable that unifies the development site and connects with adjacent development and destinations transit facilities are important cthe city shall encourage and assist in the accumulation of

the following standards 1all trees shrubs and ground cover to be planted must be native plants selected from the portland plant list 2plant size replacement trees must be at least onehalf inch in caliper measured at six inches above the ground level for field grown trees or above the soil line for container grown trees the onehalf inch minimum size may be an average caliper measure recognizing that trees are not uniformly round unless they are oak or madrone which may be one gallon size shrubs must be in at least a onegallon container or the equivalent in ball and burlap and must be at least 12 inches in height 3plant coverage anative trees and shrubs are required to be planted at a rate of five trees and 25 shrubs per every 500 square feet of disturbance area calculated by dividing the number of square feet of disturbance area by 500 and then multiplying that result times five trees and 25 shrubs and rounding all fractions to the nearest whole number of trees and shrubs  for example if there will be 330 square feet of disturbance area then 330 divided by 500 equals 066 and 066 times five equals 33 so three trees must be planted and 066 times 25 equals 165 so 17 shrubs must be planted bare ground must be planted or seeded with native grasses or herbs nonnative sterile wheat grass may also be planted or seeded in equal or lesser proportion to the native grasses or herbs btrees shall be planted between eight and 12 feet on center and shrubs shall be planted between four and five feet on center or clustered in single species groups of no more than four plants

requirements for unlisted uses reservoir areas required for drivein uses driveways required on site offstreet loading spaces exemptions to parking requirements design and standards  purpose the purpose of this chapter is to provide standards for the number and arrangement of parking loading and reservoir areas most of these provisions relate to commercial office and industrial uses parking lot design has often been criticized for creating large expanses of paved areas separating the business from the public street that arrangement makes it less attractive for pedestrians to access these buildings the challenge is balancing the business communitys desire for ample visible parking to attract prospective customers with the community interest of encouraging safe nonvehicular access minimizing the visual impact of parking and creating a more attractive streetscape and urban environment most parking facilities in nonresidential developments contain spaces which are infrequently used available for the few days a year when parking is at a premium for these spaces permeable parking surfaces provide a suitable parking surface which can reduce surface runoff and increase water quality as well as improve the aesthetic appearance of the parking lot west linn encourages the use of permeable parking surfaces in appropriate situations     applicability and general provisions aat the time a structure is erected or enlarged or the use of a structure or unit of land is changed within any zone parking spaces loading areas and reservoir areas shall be provided in accordance with

the same or separate sites are able to share the same parking spaces because their parking demands occur at different times joint use of required parking spaces is allowed if the following documentation is submitted in writing to the planning director as part of a building or zoning permit application or land use review 1the names and addresses of the owners or tenants that are sharing the parking and the uses at those locations  2the location and number of parking spaces that are being shared  3an analysis showing that the peak parking times of the uses occur at different times and that the parking area will be large enough for the anticipated demands of both uses  and 4a legal instrument such as an easement or deed restriction that guarantees access to the parking for all uses

the purpose of this chapter is to provide for the design selection installation and maintenance of landscaping the landscaping is intended to provide an attractive natural balance to built areas to reduce runoff to provide shade to screen or buffer uses and to frame or complement views the chapter also encourages the selection of plant materials that will provide longterm growth a balance of yearround coverage and greenery and a variety of species for a more healthy diseaseresistant plant inventory  approval criteria aevery development proposal requires inventorying existing site conditions which include trees and landscaping in designing the new project every reasonable attempt should be made to preserve and protect existing trees and to incorporate them into the new landscape plan similarly significant landscaping eg bushes shrubs should be integrated the rationale is that saving a 30foottall mature tree helps maintain the continuity of the site they are qualitatively superior to two or three twoinch caliper street trees they provide immediate microclimate benefits eg shade they soften views of the street and they can increase the attractiveness

elements shall be designed and located so that all heritage trees as defined in the municipal code shall be saved diseased heritage trees as determined by the city arborist may be removed at hisher direction 2all heritage trees as defined in the municipal code all trees and clusters of trees cluster is defined as three or more trees with overlapping driplines  however native oaks need not have an overlapping dripline that are considered significant by the city arborist either individually or in consultation with certified arborists or similarly qualified professionals based on accepted arboricultural standards including consideration of their size type location health long term survivability andor numbers shall be protected pursuant to the criteria of subsections b2a f of this section in cases where there is a difference of opinion on the significance of a tree or tree cluster the city arborists findings shall prevail it is important to acknowledge that all trees are not significant and further that this code section will not necessarily protect all trees deemed significant anonresidential and residential projects on type i and ii lands shall protect all heritage trees and all significant trees and tree clusters by limiting development in the protected area the protected area includes the protected tree its dripline and an additional 10 feet beyond the dripline as depicted in the figure below development of type i and ii lands shall require the careful layout of streets driveways building pads lots and utilities to avoid heritage trees and significant trees and tree clusters and other natural resources pursuant to this code the method for delineating the protected trees or tree clusters dripline plus 10 feet is explained in subsection b2b of this section exemptions of subsections b2c e and f of this section shall apply image protected area   dripline + 10 feet bnonresidential and residential projects on nontype i and ii lands shall set aside up to 20 percent of the protected areas for significant trees and tree clusters plus any heritage trees therefore in the event that the city arborist determines that a significant tree cluster exists at a development site then up to 20 percent of the nontype i and ii lands shall be devoted to the protection of those trees by limiting development in the protected areas the exact percentage is determined by establishing the driplines of the trees or tree clusters that are to be protected in order to protect the roots which typically extend further an additional 10foot measurement beyond the dripline shall be added the square footage of the area inside this dripline plus 10 feet measurement shall be the basis for calculating the percentage see figure below the city arborist will identify which trees are to be protected development of nontype i and ii lands shall also require the careful layout of streets driveways building pads lots and utilities to avoid significant trees tree clusters heritage trees and other natural resources pursuant to this code exemptions of subsections b2c e and f of this section shall apply please note that in the event that more than 20 percent of the nontype i and ii lands comprise significant trees or tree clusters the developer shall not be required to save the excess trees but is encouraged to do so image eg dripline + 10 feet  area   2500 sq feet  or 18% of total nontype i and ii land density calculations for this parcel will be based on remaining net sq footage of site excluding the 2500 sq feet  cwhere stubouts of streets occur on abutting properties and the extension of those streets will mean the loss of significant trees tree clusters or heritage trees it is understood that tree loss may be inevitable in these cases the objective shall be to minimize tree loss these provisions shall also apply in those cases where access per construction code standards to a lot or parcel is blocked by a row or screen of significant trees or tree clusters dfor both nonresidential and residential development the layout shall achieve at least 70 percent of maximum density for the developable net area the developable net area excludes all type i and ii lands and up to 20 percent of the remainder of the site for the purpose of protection of stands or clusters of trees as defined in subsection b2 of this section efor arterial and collector street projects including oregon department of transportation street improvements the roads and graded areas shall avoid tree clusters where possible significant trees tree clusters and heritage tree loss may occur however but shall be minimized fif the protection of significant trees or tree clusters is to occur in an area of grading that is necessary for the development of street grades per city construction codes which will result in an adjustment in the grade of over or under two feet which will then threaten the health of the trees the applicant will submit evidence to the planning director that all reasonable alternative grading plans have been considered and cannot work the applicant will then submit a mitigation plan to the city arborist to compensate for the removal of the trees on an inch by inch basis eg a 48inch douglas fir could be replaced by 12 trees each fourinch the mix of tree sizes and types shall be approved by the city arborist 3the topography and natural drainage shall be preserved to the greatest degree possible 4the structures shall not be located in areas subject to slumping and sliding the comprehensive plan background reports hazard map or updated material as available and as deemed acceptable by the planning director shall be the basis for preliminary determination 5there shall be adequate distance between onsite buildings and onsite and offsite buildings on adjoining properties to provide for adequate light and air circulation and for fire protection 6architecture athe proposed structures scale shall be compatible with the existing structures on site and on adjoining sites contextual design is required contextual design means respecting and incorporating prominent architectural styles building lines roof forms rhythm of windows building scale and massing of surrounding buildings in the proposed structure the materials and colors shall be complementary to the surrounding buildings image bwhile there has been discussion in cdc about transition it is appropriate that new buildings should architecturally transition in terms of bulk and mass to work with or fit adjacent existing buildings this transition can be accomplished by selecting designs that step down or step up from small to big structures and vice versa see figure below transitions may also take the form of carrying building patterns and lines eg parapets windows etc from the existing building to the new one image image ccontrasting architecture shall only be permitted when the design is manifestly superior to adjacent architecture in terms of creativity design and workmanship andor it is adequately separated from other buildings by distance screening grade variations or is part of a development site that is large enough to set its own style of architecture dhuman scale is a term that seeks to accommodate the users of the building and the notion that buildings should be designed around the human scale ie their size and the average range of their perception human scale shall be accommodated in all designs by for example multilight windows that are broken up into numerous panes intimately scaled entryways and visual breaks exaggerated eaves indentations ledges parapets awnings engaged columns etc in the facades of buildings both vertically and horizontally the human scale is enhanced by bringing the building and its main entrance up to the edge of the sidewalk it creates a more dramatic and interesting streetscape and improves the height and width ratio referenced in this section image human scale is captured in this example ethe main front elevation of commercial and office buildings shall provide at least 60 percent windows or transparency at the pedestrian level to create more interesting streetscape and window shopping opportunities one side elevation shall provide at least 30 percent transparency any additional side or rear elevation which is visible from a collector road or greater classification shall also have at least 30 percent transparency transparency on other elevations is optional the transparency is measured in lineal fashion for example a 100footlong building elevation shall have at least 60 feet 60 percent of 100 feet in length of windows the window height shall be at minimum three feet tall the exception to transparency would be cases where demonstrated functional constraints or topography restrict that elevation from being used when this exemption is applied to the main front elevation the square footage of transparency that would ordinarily be required by the above formula shall be installed on the remaining elevations at pedestrian level in addition to any transparency required by a side elevation and vice versa the rear of the building is not required to include transparency the transparency must be flush with the building elevation image 60 percent of lineal street facing or main elevation is windows 30 percent of one side elevation is windows you may transfer windows from the side to front or vice versa image windows not at eye level andor not flush with building fvariations in depth and roof line are encouraged for all elevations to vary the otherwise blank wall of most rear elevations continuous flat elevations of over 100 feet in length should be avoided by indents or variations in the wall the use of decorative brick masonry or stone insets andor designs is encouraged another way to vary or soften this elevation is variations such as an undulating grass area with trees to provide vertical relief gconsideration of the microclimate eg sensitivity to wind sun angles shade etc shall be made for building users pedestrians and transit users including features like awnings hthe vision statement identified a strong commitment to developing safe and attractive pedestrian environments with broad sidewalks canopied with trees and awnings image trees awnings and building orientation enhance microclimate isidewalk cafes kiosks vendors and street furniture are encouraged however at least a fourfootwide pedestrian accessway must be maintained per cdc sidewalk use 7transportation the automobile shall be shifted from a dominant role relative to other modes of transportation by the following means acommercial and office development shall be oriented to the street at least one public entrance shall be located facing an arterial street  or if the project does not front on an arterial facing a collector street  or if the project does not front on a collector facing the local street with highest traffic levels parking lots shall be placed behind or to the side of commercial and office development when a large andor multibuilding development is occurring on a large undeveloped tract three plus acres it is acceptable to focus internally  however at least 20 percent of the main adjacent rightofway shall have buildings contiguous to it unless waived per subsection b7c of this section these buildings shall be oriented to the adjacent street and include pedestrianoriented transparencies on those elevations for individual buildings on smaller individual lots at least 30 lineal feet or 50 percent of the building must be adjacent to the rightofway unless waived per subsection b7c of this section the elevations oriented to the rightofway must incorporate pedestrianoriented transparency bmultifamily projects shall be required to keep the parking at the side or rear of the buildings or behind the building line of the structure as it would appear from the rightofway inside the multifamily project for any garage which is located behind the building line of the structure but still facing the front of the structure architectural features such as patios patio walls trellis porch roofs overhangs pergolas etc shall be used to downplay the visual impact of the garage and to emphasize the rest of the house and front entry image the parking may be positioned inside small courtyard areas around which the units are built these courtyard spaces encourage socialization defensible space and can provide a central location for landscaping particularly trees which can provide an effective canopy and softening effect on the courtyard in only a few years vehicular access and driveways courtyard areas is permitted ccommercial office and multifamily projects shall be built as close to the adjacent main rightofway as practical to facilitate safe pedestrian and transit access reduced frontages by buildings on public rightsofway may be allowed due to extreme topographic eg slope creek wetlands etc conditions or compelling functional limitations not just inconveniences or design challenges entrance from rightofway image daccessways parking lots and internal driveways shall accommodate pedestrian circulation and access by specially textured colored or clearly defined footpaths at least six feet wide paths shall be eight feet wide when abutting parking areas or travel lanes paths shall be separated from parking or travel lanes by either landscaping planters curbs bollards or raised surfaces sidewalks in front of storefronts on the arterials and main store entrances on the arterials identified in cdc a3 shall be 12 feet wide to accommodate pedestrians sidewalk sales sidewalk cafes etc sidewalks in front of storefronts and main store entrances in commercialobc zone development on local streets and collectors shall be eight feet wide image landscaping epaths shall provide direct routes that pedestrians will use between buildings adjacent rightsofway and adjacent commercial developments they shall be clearly identified they shall be laid out to attract use and to discourage people from cutting lots and impacting environmentally sensitive areas image direct pedestrian route required   fat least one entrance to the building shall be on the main street or as close as possible to the main street the entrance shall be designed to identify itself as a main point of ingressegress gwhere transit service exists or is expected to exist there shall be a main entrance within a safe and reasonable distance of the transit stop a pathway shall be provided to facilitate a direct connection hprojects shall bring at least part of the project adjacent to or near the main street rightofway in order to enhance the heighttowidth ratio along that particular street the heighttowidth ratio is an architectural term that emphasizes height or vertical dimension of buildings adjacent to streets the higher and closer the building is and the narrower the width of the street the more attractive and intimate the streetscape becomes for every one foot in street width the adjacent building ideally should be one to two feet higher this ratio is considered ideal in framing and defining the streetscape image  height to width ratio is ideal example only ithese architectural standards shall apply to public facilities such as reservoirs water towers treatment plants fire stations pump stations power transmission facilities etc it is recognized that many of these facilities due to their functional requirements cannot readily be configured to meet these architectural standards however attempts shall be made to make the design sympathetic to surrounding properties by landscaping setbacks buffers and all reasonable architectural means jparking spaces at trailheads shall be located so as to preserve the view of and access to the trailhead entrance from the roadway the entrance apron to the trailhead shall be marked no parking and include design features to foster trail recognition ccompatibility between adjoining uses buffering and screening 1in addition to the compatibility requirements

noise lights or glare shall be buffered from adjoining residential uses in accordance with the standards in subsection c of this section where applicable 4businesses or activities that can reasonably be expected to generate noise in excess of the noise standards contained in west linn municipal shall undertake and submit appropriate noise studies and mitigate as necessary to comply with the code see cdc b11 and m if the decisionmaking authority reasonably believes a proposed use may generate noise exceeding the standards specified in the municipal code then the authority may require the

class ii design review site analysis site plan grading and drainage plans architectural drawings landscape plan exceptions to underlying parking provisions  purpose and intent  general the purpose of the parks and natural area design review provisions is to establish a process and standards for the review of park and natural area development proposals to ensure that the intent of the parks master plan is satisfied and the planned program needs of the different classes of parks and natural areas are respected and provided for attention will be paid to the proposals scale layout and design its compatibility with the natural environment and the surrounding neighborhood compliance with the transportation planning rule tpr will be encouraged but not to the point of diminution of or adverse impacts on the natural resource areas or the functionality of the park  categories of parks and natural resource facilities there are eight categories of park and natural resource facilities as established in the parks master plan the categories are 1activeoriented parks 2passiveoriented parks 3special use parks 4linear parksopen space 5city beautification areas 6pathways and trails 7natural resource areas 8multiuse parks activeoriented parks activeoriented parks are developed sites that support recreation opportunities including sports and play with facilities often featuring restrooms picnic shelters and tables passiveoriented parks passiveoriented parks are more natural sites that provide trailrelated recreation opportunities and passive outdoor activities such as wildlife watching nature interpretation and picnicking several sites also provide river views or river access special use parks special use parks are singlepurpose developed sites that include specialized facilities such as a community center boat ramp or fishing dock or other unique use linear parksopen space linear parks are open space areas that often bring together patchworks of cityowned lands stream corridors and rightsofway to create a linear facility whose primary goal is to provide a passive recreation experience limited facilities such as benches and picnic tables may be provided but these parks are primarily designed as corridors for trails bike and pedestrian paths the tpr is often well served by these bike and pedestrian paths linear parks also provide important visual relief from the built environment given their physical and visual accessibility and the fact that they can extend long distances community and be used by many neighborhoods linear parks can be one of the best investments that cities can make ideally they will be at least 100 to 200 feet wide  however critical linkages in the system can be as narrow as 10 to 20 feet if that is what it takes to make the connection trailheads at the termini of the park are helpful as are trailheads at regular intervals along the length of the linear park city beautification areas and public spaces city beautification areas are intended to provide for the aesthetic needs of the residents rather than a physical experience these areas provide a visual experience they can take the form of landscaped entryways to the city landscaped medians or street corners expanding beyond that definition and the expectations of the parks master plan this park category shall also include public spaces such as plazas and squares where the emphasis is on outdoor concerts farmers markets street fairs and socialization pathways and trails pathways and trails may be incorporated into park facilities but may also be standalone facilities in open space communities provide urban paths and trails for their recreational value as well as their value as part of a communitys commitment to the tpr trails and paths should be developed to provide linkages between schools parks neighborhoods and the community and even integrate with regional trail systems an example would be the trails and paths that crisscross the tanner basin neighborhood of west linn and make it possible for children to access school on foot or bicycle in relative safety rudimentary gravel foot trails can be three to six feet wide paths in high use areas should be in the four to 10foot width range and paved in neighborhoods that are built up with limited space to accommodate the paths or trails reduced widths and nontraditional designs are encouraged if the alternative is no trail or path at all emphasis on providing routes that follow the cognitive patterns of residents is important surveillance potential and defensible space are also important considerations natural resource areas the primary focus is on the longterm protection of natural areas these natural areas can come in the form of natural drainageways creeks wetlands river greenway areas habitat protection areas steep hillsides significant tree clusters or plant materials or where the preservation of an open space area provides a visual relief from the images of the built and urbanized environment since the emphasis is upon the protection of the resource the facilities should be limited typically these facilities include interpretive centers restrooms trails vehicular access and parking lots active recreation facilities such as organized playing fields are discouraged they should only be accommodated if the park is large enough and there is adequate separation between the activity area and the natural resource at all times the central philosophy is deference to the natural resource over human needs multiuse parks multiuse parks mix developed and natural areas and offer both active and passive recreation opportunities ranging from active sports to quiet nature strolls several of these parks also have amenities and facilities to support large group gatherings and events     applicability athis chapter applies to the development of all new parks and natural resource areas it also applies to changes including the introduction of new facilities and major repairs at existing parks and natural resource areas no work except as exempted in cdc  may take place in these parks and natural resource areas without first obtaining a permit chapter and appropriate decisionmaking body cdc design review shall not apply to park development or structures or facilities in parks unless specifically exempted by this chapter all relevant cdc chapters shall apply bthere are two classes of park design review  class i and class ii class i park design review applies to minor changes to park facilities it is reasonable and appropriate that a simpler but more focused set of standards shall apply class ii park design review applies to the development of any new park or significant changes to an existing park or natural area the specific submittal standards and approval criteria are explained in cdc  class i design review the following is a nonexclusive list of class i design review activities or facilities 1new sidewalks if over 200 feet long see cdc  2new trails if over 200 feet long see cdc  3new paths if over 200 feet long see cdc  4additional recreation amenities or facilities including playground equipment picnic shelters and playing fields so long as those facilities are consistent with the program established for the park and the impacts are expected to be minor an example of program consistency would be class i design review of a proposal to add two more swing sets at an activeoriented park  conversely it would be a class ii if the proposal would add swing sets in a natural resource area 5fences and walls over 200 feet long see cdc  6addition or reduction of less than 10 percent of total square footage of an existing building so long as there is no encroachment towards a resource area 7minor road realignment under 200 feet long realignment must not come closer to any existing resource area than it currently is 8ten percent additions or reduction of parking stalls so long as required minimum number of spaces is still met 9major modification of a landscape plan including water features ponds pergolas arbors artwork sculptings etc replacement of one type of flowers with another or tree planting would not have to go minor modifications andor minor upgrades or repairs of public or private utilities in the park or resource area any proposed excavation or grading within a drainageway will require class i review and will be covered with a natural drainageway permit emergency repairs authorized by the city manager would be exempt from this chapter per cdc  postemergency site restoration or mitigation would however be required 11americans with disability act ada compliance eg ramps and paths is exempt when the improvement is outside of a natural resource area per cdc

removal of a park or natural open space facility or site feature this could involve for example the elimination of a softball diamond 14other land uses and activities may be added if the planning director makes written findings that the activityuse will not increase impacts to any nearby resource area or abutting residential property does not conflict with the program established for the specific park or natural resource areaopen space and is consistent with the type andor scale of activitiesuses listed above dclass ii design review the following is a nonexclusive list of class ii parks design review activities or facilities 1site preparation for andor development of a new park or natural area 2outward expansion of an existing park or natural area 3addition or reduction of more than 10 percent of total square footage of an existing building including any dimensional change if it would result in encroachment towards a natural resource area 4any program change that results in a change in the function and classification of the park or resource area eg from active park with playing fields to passive park with no playing fields any change that puts park program at odds with or in violation of parks master plan 5any change or proposed development which by its scale or scope of work requires that a full and comprehensive review be undertaken in the public forum see cdc  exemptions for buildings over 10000 square feet  exemptions the provisions of this chapter exempt the following activities from review aarchitectural or other replacement in kind an example would be replacing a composition roof on a picnic shelter with a new composition roof replacing the grass turf of a playing field with synthetic turf would be an example of other replacement in kind also exempt is replacement in kind of building materials that are equal or superior to existing materials for example replacing t111 wood siding with cedar lap siding or brick or replacing a gravel path with an asphalt path for buildings the replacement in kind cannot constitute more than 50 percent of the valuation of the structure  if it does then class i or ii design review is required depending on the size of the building eg a 10foot by sevenfoot tool shed would be class i the planning director shall make the initial code interpretation this interpretation is reviewable and amendable by the planning commission bchanges in color schemes wall art and freestanding statuary or art under five feet tall are exempt from design review but shall be subject to planning director review under the provisions of cdc a2 prescribed conditions with consideration of cdc  no published findings or notice are required crevision to parking alignment or circulation so long as it only involves restriping or painting new directional arrows these changes will be subject to cdc a2 dada facilities such as access ramps and modifications to accessways to improve accessibility outside of resource areas are exempt eremoval of ivy and other invasive vegetation such as from trees and elsewhere including in natural resource areas fconstruction of new sidewalks paths and trails that are less than 200 feet

park space being used for parking the surrounding streets also provide transitions between on and offsite activities as discussed in subsection d1 of this section physical access is also facilitated by having good cognitive locations that can be safely accessed by bike paths and sidewalks improved visual access amplifies the investment and positive benefits of parks in that many people who do not stop the car and actually use the park derive emotional benefits by exposure to scenes of open space trees and grass fields in a world increasingly dominated by built environments crelationship to the natural environment 1the buildings and other site elements shall be designed and located so that all heritage trees as defined in the municipal code shall be saved diseased heritage trees as determined by the city arborist may be removed at the direction of the city manager 2all heritage trees as defined in the municipal code and all trees and clusters of trees cluster is defined as three or more trees with overlapping driplines  however native oaks need not have an overlapping dripline that are considered significant by the city arborist either individually or in consultation with certified arborists or similarly qualified professionals based on accepted arboricultural standards including consideration of their size type location health long term survivability andor numbers shall be protected pursuant to the criteria of cdc b2 it is important to acknowledge that all trees are not significant aareas of the park that include nontype i and ii lands shall protect all heritage trees and all significant trees careful layout of streets building pads playing fields and utilities the method for delineating the protected trees or tree clusters dripline + 10 feet is explained in cdc b2a and in subsection c2b of this section image protected area   dripline + 10 feet bareas of the park that include type i and ii lands shall protect all heritage significant and nonsignificant trees groundcover bushes etc shall be protected and may only be disturbed to allow the construction of trails or accessing and repairing utilities exemptions permitted under cdc b2c f shall apply 3in the case of natural resource areas the topography shall be preserved to the greatest degree possible conversely in nonnatural resource areas it is recognized that in order to accommodate level playing fields in an activeoriented park extensive grading may be required and the topography may be modified 4the structures shall not be located in areas subject to slumping and sliding the comprehensive plan background reports hazard map or updated material as available and as deemed acceptable by the planning director shall be the basis for preliminary determination 5the park shall be designed in such a way as to take advantage of scenic views and vistas from the park site as long as such views can be obtained without eliminating significant trees or other natural vegetated areas dfacility design and relationship to the human environment 1architecture whereas most park buildings are small in size and compatible with existing structures on site and on adjoining sites the possibility of larger facilities exists larger buildings are defined as those over 1000 square feet and under 10000 square feet in size in those cases contextual design is required contextual design means respecting and incorporating prominent architectural styles building lines roof forms rhythm of windows building scale and massing materials and colors of surrounding buildings in the proposed structure also important is breaking the larger building into smaller visual components so that the mass of the building is not so apparent this is especially relevant when the building is near the perimeter of the park however certain uses by virtue of their functional and spatial requirements are large and can never be made visually equal or even compatible with nearby homes such uses shall not be prohibited from locating at activeoriented park facilities on architectural grounds so long as the applicants architect has broken down the buildings horizontal plane into smaller visual components and stepped down the building at the end closest to the offsite structures smaller visual components shall be defined as changes in the horizontal plane every 100 feet created by indentations or popouts at least three feet in depth stepping down shall be defined as bringing the park buildings end section that is closest to offsite dwellings to half the distance between the highest ridgeline of the park structure and the highest ridgeline of the nearest offsite structure in those cases where visual component breakdown or stepping down is not feasible the applicant may rely on transitions in terms of distance as reasonable mitigation between on and offsite buildings an appropriate minimum distance to achieve mitigation shall be either 150 feet or an existing public rightofway 2material park structures shall emphasize natural materials such as exposed timbers wood with brick and stone detail colors are subdued earth tones grays brown offwhites black slate and greens 3human scale is a term that seeks to accommodate the users of the building and the notion that buildings should be designed around the human scale eg average range of human perception for large buildings defined as over 1000 square feet and less than 10000 square feet in size human scale shall be accommodated by for example multilight windows that are broken up into numerous panes intimately scaled entryways visual breaks exaggerated eaves indentations belly boards ledges cornices awnings engaged columns etc in the facades of buildings both vertically and horizontally but particularly within the first 10 to 15 feet as measured vertically 4transparency for all enclosed buildings in the park with the exception of public restrooms storage and utility buildings the mainfront building elevation shall provide at least 60 percent windows or transparency at the pedestrian level to create a more interesting building elevation allow naturalambient interior lighting and enhance defensible space one side elevation shall provide at least 30 percent transparency transparency on other elevations is optional the transparency is measured in lineal fashion for example a 100foot long building elevation shall have at least 60 feet 60 percent of 100 feet in length of windows the window height shall be at minimum three feet tall the exception to transparency would be cases where demonstrated functional constraints or topography restrict that elevation from being used when this exemption is applied to a building elevations the square footage of transparency that would ordinarily be required by the above formula shall be installed on the remaining elevations in addition to any transparency required by a side elevation and vice versa the transferred transparency is not required to be at pedestrian level and may be incorporated into clerestories or dormers the rear of the building is not required to include transparency the transparency must be flush with the building elevation etransportation planning rule tpr compliance the tpr is a state requirement to reduce dependence upon the private automobile reduce the total number of vehicle miles traveled and reduce carbon monoxide emissions one way this can be achieved is by providing greater connectivity within the city from one neighborhood to the next so that circuitous fuelconsuming trips are reduced where park space is bisected by a planned arterial connector as identified in the citys transportation master plan then that arterial shall be constructed as part of the park project where proposed collector or local streets are shown on the transportation master plan or where existing roads stub out adjacent to the parks property the road shall also go except in those cases where one of the following criteria is met 1the road will eliminate or adversely affect the functional value of the park eg it would go only reasonable location for a planned soccer field 2the road will adversely affect the quality or quantity of a natural resource areaopen space eg construction of the road will require grading or fill in the resource area  the increased traffic associated with the road will diminish the restorative contemplative and natural interpretative opportunities associated with the resource  the impact of the traffic such as noise pollutants and glare will make the area less attractive as a wildlife habitat or corridor andor have adverse environmental impacts on the resource etc 3the road will be in conflict with the city charter languages fcompatibility between adjoining uses 1onsite screening from view from adjoining properties of such things as service and storage areas shall be provided and the following factors will be considered in determining the adequacy of the type and extent of the screening awhat needs to be screened bthe direction from which it is needed chow dense the screen needs to be dwhether the viewer

and in neighborhoods in terms of increased traffic loads noise vibrations and glare streets shall be installed per cdc standards sidewalks shall be installed per cdc a16 and h both chapters allow reduced sidewalk widths to accommodate topographic limitations or to preserve trees 2parking lots cdc  explains the parking requirements for the various categories of parks and open space areas city squares malls or plazas are exempt from the parking requirements of cdc reduced parking requirements are explained in cdc  except for areas accommodating ada disabled parking and ada access parking lots may be constructed with grasscrete 3storm detention and treatment and geologic hazards per the submittals required by cdc  and e all proposed storm detention and treatment facilities must comply with the standards for the improvement of public and private drainage systems located in the west linn public works design standards there will be no adverse offsite impacts caused by the development including impacts from increased intensity of runoff downstream or constrictions causing ponding upstream and the applicant must provide sufficient factual data to support the conclusions of the submitted plan per the submittals required by cdc e the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed methods of rendering known or potential hazard sites safe for development including proposed geotechnical remediation are feasible and adequate to prevent landslides or other damage to property and safety the review authority may impose conditions including limits on type or intensity of land use which it determines are necessary to mitigate known risks of landslides or property damage ipaths and trails paths and trails connect the various activity areas within the park they can also serve as part of a greater system of connective trails from one neighborhood or destination to another just like streets there is a hierarchy of paths and trails 1paths that connect the rightofway andor parking lot with the main activity areas of the park need to accommodate pedestrians bicyclists and persons with disabilities as grades allow the path shall be paved and five to eight feet wide lesser dimensions are allowed where topography and trees limit width the grade shall be kept to fewer than five percent where the terrain allows the path may be illuminated if the facility is programmed for night use 2paths that provide a link park to neighborhoods on either side must be recognized for their value in addressing the tpr particularly in those cases where connecting roads park or natural area are not provided per cdc c6 these trails or paths may be paved five to eight feet wide and may be illuminated narrower path sections are permitted in response to topography and to preserve trees illumination is especially important for this group if these paths are used by early morning and early evening bicycle and pedestrian commuters directional signs are needed for this type of trail and user group 3smaller or reduced width paths within park boundaries can be built to link lesser activity areas or areas of attraction walkers cyclists or runners who do multiple loops for exercise often use these paths these paths may be crushed gravel or paved and at least six feet wide 4nature trails are typically three to six feet wide gravel hog fuel or packed earth these trails are especially attractive to persons seeking quieter parts of the park for natural interpretation or solitude other user groups often use them for exercise loops trails and footbridges in natural areas should be designed to minimize disturbance of significant resources limiting access to creek beds potentially erosive slopes or wetlands by humans and dogs is an important measure if habitat or resource protection is to be addressed at least initially the use of these trails by all user groups should be encouraged changes or restrictions to some user groups shall be based on empirical observations at that specific site 5disabled access paths allow disabled persons to access specific activity areas in the park at grades that meet ada standards many parks have special disabled access paths with interpretive areas and viewpoints to allow visual if not physical access to natural resource areas usually these paths are 50 to 200 meters long eight feet wide and clearly identified 6paths or trails that link parks schools neighborhoods and the community and even integrate with adjacent cities or regional trails may be paved five to 10 feet wide the paths or trails should follow easily identified cognitive routes with good surveillance and defensible space 7all paths and trails shall be clearly identified with signs they shall be laid out to attract use and to discourage people from cutting

colocation protocol athe purpose of this requirement is to create a process that will allow providers to equitably share publicly available nonproprietary information among themselves with interested persons and agencies and with the approval authority at the time the provider schedules a preapplication conference with the approval authority this colocation protocol is designed to increase the likelihood that all reasonable opportunities for colocation have been investigated and that the appropriate information has been shared among the providers the approval authority recognizes that colocation is preferable where technologically feasible and visually desirable as a matter of public policy but that colocation of antennas by providers is not always feasible for technical or business reasons however if all licensed providers are made aware of any pending tower or antenna permit requests such disclosure will allow providers to have the maximum amount of time to consider possible colocation opportunities and will also assure the approval authority that all reasonable accommodations for colocation have been investigated the code creates strong incentives for colocation because proposals for colocation qualify for a less rigorous approval process building permit or design review approval rather than a discretionary land use permit ba preapplication conference is required for all proposed freestanding support structures cat the time a preapplication conference is scheduled the applicant shall demonstrate that the following notice was mailed to all other

modify specific requirements in order to provide a superior site design that would not otherwise be possible under the standard requirements of the code 1 the planning commission may approve a special waiver due to the unique nature of the proposed development if it finds that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development ademonstrates that the proposed development can

neighborhood and community and increase opportunities for socialization 2to comply with the states transportation planning rule tpr which seeks to encourage alternate forms of transportation and reduce reliance upon the private automobile and vehicle miles traveled by increasing accessibility within and between subdivisions and neighborhoods this may be accomplished by designing an easily understood interconnected pattern of streets bicycle and foot paths and accommodation of transit facilities culdesacs are to be discouraged unless site conditions dictate otherwise 3to reduce pedestrianvehicle conflicts and create a safe and attractive environment for pedestrians and bicyclists 4to protect natural resource areas such as drainageways willamette and tualatin river greenways creeks habitat areas and wooded areas as required by other provisions of this code or by the layout of streets and graded areas so as to minimize their disturbance 5to protect the natural features and topography by minimizing grading and site disturbance and by requiring proper erosion control techniques 6to arrange the lots and streets so as to minimize nuisance conditions such as glare noise and vibration 7to maximize passive solar heating benefits by orienting the streets on an easttowest axis which increases exposure to the sun 8to arrange for the efficient layout of utilities and infrastructure as well as their extension to adjacent properties in a manner consistent with either adopted utility plans or sound engineering practices 9to arrange lots and roads to create reasonably buildable lots and acceptable driveway grades 10to encourage the arrangement of increased densities and smaller lots in proximity to needed services and schools as well as transportation corridors so as to reduce vehicle miles traveled and to encourage alternate modes of travel 11to encourage design experimentation and creativity 12to arrange for the mitigation of impacts generated by new development these impacts include increased automobile foot and bicycle traffic these impacts are to be mitigated at the developers cost by the provision of streets sidewalks bicycle and foot paths and traffic control devices within contiguous to and nearby the development site similarly increased demand on local infrastructure such as water lines sanitary sewer lines and storm drainage and

existing and planned streets to the generalized or reasonable layout of streets on adjacent undeveloped lots or parcels to topographical conditions to public convenience and safety to accommodate various types of transportation automobile bus pedestrian bicycle and to the proposed use of land to be served by the streets the functional class of a street aids in defining the primary function and associated design standards for the facility the hierarchy of the facilities within the network in regard to the type of traffic served local trips balance of function providing access andor capacity and the level of use generally measured in vehicles per day are generally dictated by the functional class the street system shall assure an adequate traffic or circulation system with intersection angles grades tangents and curves appropriate for the traffic to be carried streets should provide for the continuation or the appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas and should not impede or adversely affect development of adjoining lands or access thereto to accomplish this the emphasis should be upon a connected continuous pattern of local collector and arterial streets rather than discontinuous curvilinear streets and culdesacs deviation from this pattern of connected streets should only be permitted in cases of extreme topographical challenges including excessive slopes 35 percentplus hazard areas steep drainageways wetlands etc in such cases deviations may be allowed but the connected continuous pattern must be reestablished once the topographic challenge is passed streets should be oriented with consideration of the sun as site conditions allow so that over 50 percent of the front building lines of homes are oriented within 30 degrees of an eastwest axis internal streets are the responsibility of the developer all streets bordering the development site are to be developed by the developer with typically halfstreet improvements or to city standards prescribed by the city engineer additional travel lanes may be required to be consistent with adjacent road widths or to be consistent with the adopted transportation system plan tsp and any adopted updated plans an applicant may submit a written request for a waiver of abutting street improvements if the tsp prohibits the street improvement for which the waiver is requested those areas
