requirements and authority of fs   the local government comprehensive planning and land development regulation act the city of pahokee charter effective may 1199 and the general powers in fs ch 166125 city of pahokee government applicability a general applicability except as specifically provided below the provisions of this code shall apply to all development in the city of pahokee and no development shall be undertaken without prior authorization pursuant to this code b exceptions 1 previously issued development permits the provisions of this code and any amendments thereto shall not affect the validity of any lawfully issued and effective development permit if a the development activity authorized by the permit has been commenced prior to the effective date of this code or any amendment thereto or will be commenced after the effective date of this code but within six 6 months of issuance of the building permit  and b the development activity continues without interruption except because of war or natural disaster until the development is complete if the development permit expires any further development on that site shall occur only in conformance with the requirements of this code or amendment thereto 2 previously approved development orders projects with development orders that have not expired at the time this code or an amendment thereto is adopted and on which development activity has commenced or does commence and proceeds according to the time limits in the regulations under which the development was originally approved must meet only the requirements of the regulations in effect when the development plan was approved if the development plan expires or is otherwise invalidated any further development on that site shall occur only in conformance with the requirements of this code or amendment thereto 3 consistency with plan nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize development that is inconsistent with the city of pahokee comprehensive plan guide for users a the integration of land development regulations this integrated land development code was enacted to replace the land development regulations that had been adopted piecemeal over the years and were thus scattered throughout the local code of ordinances these scattered regulations lacked coordination and were difficult to find administer and understand the replacement of these scattered regulations with an integrated land development code should greatly enhance the efficiency effectiveness and consistency of land development regulations by the city of pahokee this being an integrated code it should be noted that there is article xiv of the code labeled subdivision regulations thus stormwater requirements for development including subdivisions are found in the article labeled stormwater management in general terms with reference to article xiv subdivision for specific requirements of developments  tree planting requirements are found in the landscaping part and so forth likewise there is article vii labeled planned development pd the distinction between pd developments and others is that it is to be uitilized for existing large nonconforming uses and for the development of undeveloped lands thus all commercial development and all residential development except the building of a dwelling on a lot of record must go review process in short this code establishes a single set of site design criteria and development review procedures this integration results in a different layout and an unfamiliar table of contents but should as familiarity with the code increases result in a much more streamlined and effective land development regulatory system b checklist for preparation and review of development proposals every attempt has been made to make this code as easy as possible for interested citizens developers and local government staff to use and at the same time implement state mandates the articles are arranged in an order that reflects the process by which a developer would start with a parcel of land and conclude with an approved development this same ordering provides a checklist approach for interested citizens and staff who are reviewing a proposed development for compliance and consistency with code requirements the ordering and checklist are as follows article i general provisions this article contains general provisions necessary to determine the applicability of the code and to ensure the codes legal validity above applicability establishes which development must comply with the requirements of this code certain development activities are not covered if they are authorized by previously approved development plans thus an initial question is whether proposed development activity is covered by this code or by rules in effect prior to the adoption of this code once a determination is made that this code applies this users guide should be reviewed in order to gain an understanding of how the code works the remainder of article i need not be reviewed unless a question of intent interpretation or validity of a regulation arises article ii land use type density and intensity the first question regarding the development of any site is what use and what density or intensity of that use is allowed on the site provides the answer to this question the following is a checklist of provisions that should be consulted with regard to a development proposal ____________ in what land use district is the development site located see article iv ____________ what uses are allowed in that district see article v ____________ if a residential development is to be proposed what is the allowable density dwelling units per acre see article iv sections 1458 to 1469 ____________ if a neighborhood commercial development is to be proposed what is the allowable intensity floor area ratio of the development see article xi supplemental regulations once the use and its intensity and density have been determined for a site it must be determined whether the site is within an overlay district for example if the site is within a historic district or site plan review development and review restrictions will apply this article contains all overlay districts that might affect a site the following is a checklist of provisions that should be consulted with regard to a development proposal ____________ is the site a historic landmark or within a designated historic district to be determined at a later date ____________ does the proposed development activity involve the construction of a house in an existing subdivision ____________ is the site within the site plan review designated overlay zone which are those properties fronting lake ave bacom point road and east main street article iii concurrency management and review the final question to be answered with regard to whether the use and density or intensity of that use is appropriate for the site is whether the consistency and concurrency requirements are met the purpose of article iii is to ensure that proposed development is consistent with the local comprehensive plan because the land development code is required to implement the comprehensive plan it may be reasonable to assume that all development that conforms to all provisions of the land development code is consistent with the comprehensive plan no presumption may be created however for that form of consistency referred to as concurrency in order for the concurrency requirement to be met each development proposal must show that adopted levels of service for certain public facilities and services will not be degraded by the impact of the development the following is a checklist of provisions that should be consulted with regard to a development proposal ____________ is the development except for concurrency consistent with the comprehensive plan ____________ is the general concurrency requirement met specifically

the proposed development create solid waste see section 14425 ____________ will the proposed development create a need for public recreation see section 14426 ____________ will the development have an impact on ridership of the mass transit system see section 14427 article xiii resource protection standards once the use and the density and intensity of that use is determined for a site the next question is whether any portions of the site must remain totally or partially free of development activity prescribes those areas and the restrictions that apply within them the following is a checklist of provisions that should be consulted with regard to a development proposal ____________ does the site contain protected trees or a canopy road as defined in the code see article xiii

wellhead as defined in the code see article xiii division 4 ____________ does the site contain habitat of threatened or endangered species see article xiii division 5 ____________ does the site contain land in the 100year flood plain see article xiii division 6 article vi development design and improvement standards once the developable portions of the site have been determined the next question is how the actual development will be designed and what improvements will be required contains standards which have been made as flexible as possible for controlling the design of the development so that maximum public benefit is realized the following is a checklist of provisions that should be consulted with regard to a development proposal ____________ will the development involve the subdivision of land see article viii zoning district for minimum lot area requirements and article xiv subdivision for platting procedures ____________ will the development contain buildings or other impervious surfaces see article iv and xiv for impervious surface coverage requirements ____________ will the development contain buildings or other structures see article iv for

existing development that does not conform to the use regulations in article ii andor the development design and improvement standards in article vi see article vi ____________ with regard to proposed development is relief sought from the strict application of a development design standard see article ii article ii boards and agencies at this point in the code all substantive provisions relating to the use and design of a development site have been covered if the decision to proceed with development is made the procedures for development review in article xii must be followed first however one should become familiar with the boards and agencies involved in that review establishes and describes the following boards and agencies ____________ office of the director of community development see section 1420d ____________ city commission see section 1420a ____________ planning board see section 1420b ____________ board of adjustment see section 1420c ____________ historic preservation see

article ii the next section contains flow charts showing the development review process for major and minor developments description of development review procedures the development review process is that process by which the design of the development is reviewed to determine whether it complies with the requirements of the code development plan review is required for virtually all development activity except the construction of a dwelling on a lot of record and other very minor development activity such as the installation of a sign or the removal of a protected tree there are five basic steps in the development plan review process preapplication conference concept review preliminary development plan review final development plan review and issuance of construction development permits as shown in the flow charts below some of the steps are optional for minor development but all are mandatory for major development general findings a statutory requirement florida statutes requires each florida local government to enact a single land development code which implements and is consistent with the local comprehensive plan and which contains all land development regulations for the city of pahokee b general public need controlling the location design and construction of development within the city of pahokee is necessary to maintain and improve the quality of life in the city as more fully described below specific findings relating to the various subject areas of this code with regard to the following specific subject areas of this code the city commission finds 1 administration and enforcement a a single set of administrative procedures for making all land use decisions promotes efficiency predictability and citizen participation b all development proposals should undergo a development review process to assure compliance with the requirements of this code c a mandatory preapplication conference requirement enhances communication and understanding between the department and the developer thereby improving the efficiency of the development review process d concept review allows developers to modify proposals in response to early citizen and staff comment e developments of large potential impact on the community should go more rigorous review process than others f review of planning decisions should be independent of review of land development decisions to avoid ad hoc planning on a sitebysite basis g all administrative decisions should be supported by a record with written findings to assure accountability and efficient appellate review h a quick efficient and nonpolitical avenue of appeal should be available for all ministerial and administrative decisions i enforcement of development orders and the provisions of this code should be that are efficient effective and consistent with the code enforcement procedures established by state law 2 signs a the manner of the erection location and maintenance of signs affects the public health safety morals and welfare of the people of this community b the safety of motorists cyclists pedestrians other users of the public streets is affected by the number size location lighting and movement of signs that divert the attention of drivers c the size and location of signs may if uncontrolled constitute an obstacle to effective firefighting techniques d the construction erection and maintenance of large signs suspended from or placed on the tops of buildings walls or other structures may constitute a direct danger to pedestrian and vehicular traffic below especially during periods of strong winds e uncontrolled and unlimited signs may degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism visitation and permanent economic growth 3 landscaping and tree protection a landscaping and buffering development with trees and other vegetation promotes the health safety and welfare of the community to such an extent as to justify the imposition of landscaping and buffering requirements b trees and landscaping benefit the community by 1 absorbing carbon dioxide and returning oxygen to the atmosphere  2 precipitating dust and other particulates from the air  3 providing wildlife habitat particularly for birds which in turn help control insects  4 providing soil stabilization which reduces erosion and mitigates the effect of flooding  5 providing shade which reduces energy consumption and glare and making outdoor areas more comfortable during the warm months  6 making the built environment more attractive by adding a variety of color shape and pattern and thus increasing community pride and the value of property  7 providing attractive buffering between incompatible land uses  and 8 abating noise c because native vegetation is adapted to local diseases pests soil and climate it is generally more economical and desirable than exotic species which require more pesticide fertilizer and water d exotic vegetation can crowd out native vegetation use more water and damage the environment from increased use of fertilizers and pesticides e because some trees are more beneficial than others the public benefits of tree protection may be obtained without preserving each and every tree f mangrove trees are especially valuable in stabilizing building and protecting the shoreline providing for spawning and breeding grounds for marine organisms and other wildlife and serving as the basis for most of the estuarine food chains which are critical to seventy 70 to ninety 90 percent of those species considered important from a recreational andor commercial standpoint 4 offstreet parking and loading a offstreet parking and loading of vehicles promotes the public safety and welfare by reducing traffic congestion b welldesigned offstreet parking and loading areas promote the safe and efficient storage loading and circulation of vehicles c deferring the construction of some parking areas pending determination of the actual need for parking spaces and taking into account public demand and the size of vehicles to be parked conserves open space and developable land and reduces the expense and hazard of controlling stormwater runoff d allowing the use of porous paving materials and unpaved parking areas whenever possible conserves water and energy moderates the microclimate and reduces the expense and hazards of controlling storm water runoff 5 stormwater management a increased stormwater runoff may cause erosion and pollution of ground and surface water with a variety of contaminants such as heavy metals and petroleum products b stormwater runoff often contains nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen which adversely affect flora and fauna by accelerating eutrophication of receiving waters c erosion silts up water bodies decreases their capacity to hold and transport water interferes with navigation and damages flora and fauna d installation of impervious surfaces increases the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and decreases groundwater recharge e improperly managed stormwater runoff increases the incidence and severity of flooding and endangers property and human life f improperly managed stormwater runoff alters the salinity of estuarine areas and diminishes their biological productivity g degradation of ground and surface waters imposes economic costs on the community h eighty 80 to ninetyfive 95 percent of the total annual loading of most stormwater pollutants discharged into receiving waters are concentrated in the flush created by the first one 1 inch of rainfall first flush and carried offsite in the first onehalf 12 inch of runoff i improperly managed stormwater adversely affects the drainage of offsite property 6 floodplain protection a flooding is a natural recurring phenomenon in the city of pahokee b naturally floodprone lands serve the following important functions in the regional hydrologic cycle and ecological system 1 they provide natural storage and conveyance of flood waters 2 they facilitate groundwater recharge 3 they provide temporary storage of surface waters that moderates flood elevations and the timing velocity and rate of flood discharges 4 they reduce erosion and filter nutrients sediments and other pollutants from flood waters 5 they export detritus and other food sources to open water bodies and are vital habitat for fish birds wildlife and native plant communities c naturally occurring flooding may provide recharge to groundwater and a basic source of flow to surface waters d the uncontrolled development of floodprone lands substantially degrades the health safety and welfare of the community in the following ways 1 the owners residents customers guests and employees occupying homes businesses and other structures located in floodprone areas are placed at unreasonable risk of personal injury and property damage 2 expensive and dangerous search rescue and disaster relief operations may be necessary when developed properties are flooded 3 roads public facilities and utilities associated with development may be damaged by flooding at great expense to taxpayers and rate payers 4 flooding of developed properties may lead to demands that the government construct expensive and environmentally damaging projects to control flood waters 5 normally floodfree lands are placed at risk of flooding when flood waters on natural floodprone areas are obstructed diverted displaced or channelized by development 6 water quality is degraded the supply of freshwater to estuaries is disrupted and habitat is lost 7 property values are lowered and economic activity is disrupted by damaging floods 7 protection of environmentally sensitive lands a protection of environmentally sensitive lands described or mapped in the conservation element of the comprehensive plan promotes the well being of the people of the city of pahokee it should be noted that the city does not have identified environmentally sensitive lands in its comprehensive plan however future annexation area could include sensitive area editors note the environmentally sensitive lands provisions of this code assume that all environmentally sensitive lands are mapped or otherwise identified in the conservation element of the local comprehensive plan and that the justification for a designation as environmentally sensitive is provided in terms of the beneficial functions of the environmentally sensitive areas eg wildlife habitat flood storage aquifer recharge if the mapping of environmentally sensitive areas appears only in the land use element see  6d the language of this code should be modified accordingly b wetlands serve the following beneficial functions note this section reserved for potential future identified wetland areas 1 wetlands provide natural storage and conveyance of flood waters and minimize erosion and sedimentation by reducing flood flows and the velocity of flood waters 2 coastal wetlands and inland wetlands adjoining larger lakes and rivers protect wildlife and the shoreline from destructive wave action 3 wetlands filter and help decompose sediments nutrients and other natural and manmade pollutants that would otherwise degrade surface and ground waters 4 wetlands support commercial and recreational fishing because they provide essential nutrients and hatcheries for aquatic life 5 wetlands provide habitat for rare and endangered species and provide essential breeding and protective habitats for many other birds mammals and reptiles 6 wetlands recharge ground and surface water c shorelines serve the following beneficial functions note this section reserved for future shoreline sensitive areas presently the city fronts on lake okeechobee the shoreline is controlled by the us corps of engineers the shoreline is riprapped 1 land adjoining waters or wetlands which can generally be divided into submergent transitional and upland vegetation zones provides essential habitat for many plant and animal species including species that are endangered threatened or of special concern 2 submergent transitional and upland vegetation zones serve as effective buffers against noise and other human activities which may have adverse affects on aquatic and wetland dependent wildlife 3 submergent transitional and upland vegetation zones help slow stormwater runoff flows and increase infiltration of water nutrients and other substances 4 submergent transitional and upland vegetation zones reduce predation by domestic pets on wetland and wetland dependent wildlife species d reserved if other environmentally sensitive lands are to be regulated provide justification therefor here e during the past seventy 70 years activities the us corp of engineers south florida water district east bay water management district urban development activity management and agriculture have destroyed or impaired the potential beneficial functions of some environmentally sensitive lands in the city of pahokee 8 protection of cultural resources a there are located within the city historical

determination of consistency editors note state law mandates that the land development code be consistent with and implement the comprehensive plan fs   the director of community development shall review and confirm consistency with the goals objectives and policies of the plan of all development projects on a case by case basis the developed codes as adopted will implement the intent of the citys comprehensive plan system for the management of concurrency a generally the following method of ensuring concurrency shall be know as the system for the management of concurrency symcon the symcon is based upon the city comprehensive plan especially the capital improvements element and adopted level of service standards the system is designed to ensure that the issuance of a final development order will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services the symcon also includes a monitoring system for determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards the syncom program shall be coordinated by the director of community development with the city engineer and the public services director any related costs in the review process by city staff or consultants shall be paid by the developer b adopted levels of service shall not be degraded 1 general rule a all applications for development orders shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the city b an application for a development permit shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service if there exists no development order under which the permit is sought and no development order is required prior to the issuance of the permit eg a residence on a parcel of unplatted land c the latest point at which concurrency is determined is the final development order if no development is required the latest point to determine concurrency is the first development permit on a site 2 exception notwithstanding the foregoing the prescribed levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities if upon completion of the new facilities the prescribed levels of service will be met as determined and approved by city engineer c determination of available capacity for purposes of these regulations the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by 1 adding together a the total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service  and b the total capacity of new facilities if any that will become available on or before the date of occupancy of the development the capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one 1 or more of the following is shown 1 construction of the new facilities is under way at the time of issuance of the final development order 2 the new facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities or the provision of services at the time of issuance of the final development order 3 the new facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement an enforceable development agreement may include but is not limited to development agreements pursuant to fs   or an agreement or development order pursuant to fs ch 380 such facilities shall be consistent with the capital improvements element of the city comprehensive plan the agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur all agreements shall be subject to city engineer and city attorneys review and recommendation to city commission 2 subtracting from that number the sum of a the demand for the service or facility created by existing development as documented in the city comprehensive plan  and b the demand for the service or facility created by the anticipated completion of other approved developments redevelopment or other development activity 3 action upon failure to show available capacity where available capacity cannot be shown the following methods may be used to maintain adopted level of service as approved by the city engineer a the project owner or developer may provide the necessary improvements to maintain level of service in such case the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction consistent with calculations of capacity above b the proposed project may be altered such that projected level of service is no less than the adopted level of service d burden of showing compliance on developer the burden of showing compliance with these level of service requirements shall be upon the developer in order to be approvable applications for development approval shall provide sufficient information showing compliance with these standards the director of community development and city engineer shall determined sufficiency of each application e initial determination of concurrency the initial determination of concurrency occurs during the review of the preliminary development plan and shall include compliance with the level of service standards adopted by the city f annual report 1 contents the citys community development director in coordination with the city engineer and public services director shall prepare an annual report on the symcon that includes a a summary of actual development activity including a summary of certificates of occupancy indicating quantity of development represented by type and square footage b a summary of building permit activity indicating 1 those that expired without commencing construction  2 those that are active at the time of the report  3 the quantity of development represented by the outstanding building permits  4 those that result from final development orders issued prior to the adoption of this code  and 5 those that result from final development orders issued pursuant to the requirements of this code c a summary of preliminary development orders issued indicating 1 those that expired without subsequent final development orders  2 those that are valid at the time of the report  and 3 the phases and quantity of development represented by the outstanding preliminary development orders d a summary of final development orders issued indicating 1 those that expired without subsequent building permits  2 those that were completed during the reporting period  3 those that are valid at the time of the report but do have associated building permits or construction activity  and 4 the phases and quantity of development represented by the outstanding final development orders e an evaluation of each facility and service indicating 1 the capacity available for each at the beginning of the reporting period and the end of the reporting period  2 the portion of the available capacity held for valid preliminary and final development orders  3 a comparison of the actual capacity to calculated capacity resulting from approved preliminary development orders and final development orders  4 a comparison of actual capacity and levels of service to adopted levels of service from the city comprehensive plan 5 a forecast of the capacity for each based upon the most recently updated schedule of capital improvements in the city capital improvements element 2 use of

protected environmentally sensitive zones c special uses certain uses that provide substantial public benefits may not be viable unless placed within a protected environmentally sensitive zone eg a marina that may require the use of wetland areas for lack of suitable nonsensitive sites adjacent to a water body a local government may decide to allow these uses in sensitive areas despite significant damage to the area the following example creates an exception for water dependent uses accompanied by mitigation requirements a local government may employ other exceptions relating to local conditions 1 water dependent activities a generally designated water dependent activities that are otherwise prohibited may be allowed if the developer shows 1 the public benefits of the activity substantially outweigh the adverse environmental effects on a wetland area  and 2 no practicable alternative to placement in the protected environmentally sensitive zone exists b permittable

3 other design standards for other protected environmentally sensitive zones e mitigation 1 generally a compensatory mitigation by which environmentally sensitive lands are purchased created enhanced andor restored to compensate for the loss of such lands is required whenever a special use is allowed under section 14268c of this section b the purchased created enhanced or restored environmentally sensitive land must be of the same type as that destroyed or degraded c compensatory mitigation shall not be the basis for approving a project that could not otherwise be approved d a development of a compensatory mitigation plan shall grant conservation easement under fs  70406 on the newly purchased created enhanced or restored environmentally sensitive lands to protect them from future development 2 wetlands compensatory wetland mitigation shall require that the amount of wetlands purchased created enhanced or restored be large enough to assure that the amount of wetlands destroyed

footage of development that will be allowed on a site containing all or part of such a zone this development potential may be transferred from the protected environmentally sensitive zone to the restricted development zone or beyond as provided for in the clustering and transferable development rights provisions in article x allowable development potential may not however be transferred from without the area encompassed by the restricted development zone and protected environmentally sensitive zone to within such area 3 the following special design standards applying within restricted development zones adjacent to wetlands protection zones a wherever possible natural buffers shall be retained between all development and all protected environmentally sensitive zones if a natural buffer does not exist an equivalent buffer shall be created the size of the buffer shall be the minimum necessary to prevent significant adverse effects on the protected environmentally sensitive area the factual basis of the decision as to the size of the buffer shall be stated as a finding in the written record b the developer shall completely restore any portion of a protected environmentally sensitive zone damaged during construction complete restoration means that the damaged area shall within five 5 years be operating as effectively as the natural system did prior to being destroyed c other reasonable protective measures necessary to prevent significant adverse effects on a protected environmentally sensitive zone may be required the factual basis of the decision to require the measure shall be stated as a finding in the written record protective measures may include but are not limited to 1 maintaining natural drainage patterns 2 limiting the removal of vegetation to the minimum necessary to carry out the development activity 3 expeditiously replanting denuded areas 4 stabilizing banks and other unvegetated areas by siltation and erosioncontrol measures 5 minimizing the amount of fill used in the development activity 6 disposing of dredged spoil at specified locations in a manner causing minimal environmental damage 7 constructing channels at the minimum depth

first onehalf 12 inch of runoff of the total amount required to be treated if the city or any state agency has a stormwater rule which is stricter than this standard then the stricter rule or combination of rules shall apply editors note the state imposes an additional fifty 50 percent treatment to protect outstanding florida waters and that standard has been followed here to ensure protection of water bodies adjacent to development e siltation and erosion control measures shall be applied to stabilize banks and other unvegetated areas during and after construction sediment settling ponds shall be installed for stormwater runoff prior to the creation of any impervious surfaces for lots or parcels that are cleared silt screens shall be placed between the construction site and the water body to prevent erosion and siltation editors note the city should develop erosion control guidelines and include them in this code erosion control measures such as the planting of natural vegetation or the use of riprap are preferred over solid structures such as cement walls which disrupt natural flows and processes f any channels constructed shall be of a minimum depth and width capable of achieving the intended purposes sides of channels shall reflect an equilibrium shape to prevent slumping and erosion and to allow revegetation g any dredging shall be conducted at times of minimum biological activity to avoid fish migration and spawning and other cycles and activities of wildlife h any spoil that results from dredging shall be disposed of at upland sites and

messages relating to local ecological concerns eg manatee protection n a marina shall include boat launch facilities unless the applicant can demonstrate that providing such facilities is not feasible or it is determined that the ramp would be excessively damaging to the aquatic environment editors note the idea behind this requirement is to combine destructive activities to a minimal number of sites along the shoreline providing a boat ramp at the alreadydisturbed marina site may be preferable to disturbing another site along the shoreline to provide the ramp o marinas shall have adequate restroom facilities in compliance with local health board regulations p garbage receptacles shall be provided and maintained by the marina operator at several locations convenient to users prohibited ongoing activities the following standards apply to postdevelopment activities taking place within any restricted development zone or protected environmentally sensitive zone 1 point source and

either enforce the postdevelopment standards existing enforcement process or create a process to enforce postdevelopment standards secs 1427114279  reserved division 4  groundwater and wellheads purpose and intent the purpose of groundwater protection standards is to safeguard the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city this is accomplished the protection of the principle source of water for domestic agricultural and industrial use the availability of adequate and dependable supplies of good quality water is of primary importance to the future of the city therefore standards are described in this section with the intent of protecting both the quantity and quality of the groundwater supply it is further the intent of this section to control development in and adjacent to designated wellheads to protect water supplies from potential contamination definitions the following words terms and phrases when used in this chapter shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning protected wellhead means those wellheads with a permitted capacity of one hundred thousand 100000 gpd or more wellhead protection

provide viable habitat as documented in the study required in paragraph b above e fee in lieu as an alternative to preservation of land the city may establish a feeinlieuofland program whereby the city can purchase land which will provide a significant habitat editors note requirements of this section should be based upon the data and analysis of the conservation element as an alternative to a professionallyprepared study for all lands which may provide habitat for species which are rare endangered or of special concern the city may establish a threshold for requiring such a study it is important to note that the reservation of land area must recognize that the land requirements to provide habitat which satisfy the needs for food water and shelter for affected species may be so comprehensive or specialized that every development cannot provide a meaningful quantity or quality of land small isolated areas may not function as viable habitat secs 1429214299  reserved division 6  floodplains general provisions a abrogation and greater restrictions these flood damage prevention regulations do not repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions b warning and disclaimer of liability although the degree of flood protection required by these flood damage prevention regulations is reasonable and appropriate for regulatory purposes based on scientific and engineering considerations more severe floods will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes consequently these flood damage prevention regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within those areas will be free from flooding or flood damages these flood damage prevention regulations shall not create liability on the part of the city or any of its officers or employees for any flood damages that result from reliance on these flood damage prevention regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder c declaration of public nuisance all development located or maintained within any area of special flood hazard after the adoption of this chapter in violation of these flood

designated ao ah or vo zone on the flood insurance rate map or other area designated on a map by the director of community development with base flood depths from one 1 to three 3 feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident editors note the firm maps for some communities may not contain any ao ah or vo zones in which case this definition and the regulations related thereto may be deleted area of special flood hazard means the area of special flood hazard shall include 1 all areas designated on a flood hazard boundary map as zone a or a flood insurance rate map as zones a ao ah a130 ae a99 vo or v130 ve or v the relevant flood hazard boundary map and flood insurance rate maps and any revisions

state and local governments and agencies regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be unobstructed in order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one 1 foot at any point editors note the floodway is the area that has the greatest impact on the velocity and height of flood flows further encroachment in the floodway zone is likely to increase the ability of the flood plain to convey water and development in this area is susceptible to extreme flood damage the onefoot standard is maximum allowed under federal flood insurance regulations  a larger floodway could be designated by decreasing this amount sand dunes means naturally occurring accumulations of sand in ridges or mounds landward of the beach start of construction means the date the construction permit was issued provided the actual start of construction was within one hundred eighty 180 days

substantial improvement occurs when the first alteration of any wall ceiling floor or other structural part of the structure commences whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure the term does not however include any improvement of a structure to comply with existing health sanitary or safety codes or any alteration of a structure listed on the national register of historic places the local register of historic places or a state inventory of historic places unless that alteration will cause the structure to lose its historical designation editors note this definition is used to require that improvements that equal or exceed fifty 50 percent of a structures market value must comply with the flood damage prevention requirements in this code this attempts to strike a balance between the competing demands for sound flood management and the need for owners to conduct routine repairs and maintenance of existing structures without having to comply with the code floodplain regulations are silent on the issue a period of time resulting in expenditures of over fifty 50 percent of a structures value a community is free therefore to make the code more stringent by a cumulative expenditure provision such as appears in this definition standards for reducing flood hazards in the area of special flood hazard a generally the standards in this part apply to all development within the area of special flood hazard as shown on a flood hazard boundary map or a flood insurance rate map b anchoring all new construction and substantial improvements of

flood hazard warning in the document flood hazard warning this property may be subject to flooding you should contact local building and zoning officials and obtain the latest information about flood elevations and restrictions before making plans for the use of this property standards for reducing flood hazards in certain zones within the area of special flood hazard a regulatory floodways the following standards apply to regulatory floodways located within the area of special flood hazard 1 encroachments including fill new construction substantial improvements and other development are prohibited unless a registered professional engineer certifies and demonstrates that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not result in any increase in flood levels during a base flood 2 all new construction and substantial improvements of existing construction shall comply with all applicable flood damage prevention provisions of sections 14302 and 14303 of this article editors note a floodway must be designated by a community if fema has provided the necessary data regulation of the floodway is one 1 of the most important aspects of flood damage prevention regulations it is assumed that additional development within the floodway would interfere with the normal movement of flood waters and result in a significant increase in water surface elevations by designating a floodway zone in which development is strictly limited the community can be assured that a channel will be maintained that is capable of passing floodwater associated with a base flood based on these assumptions development in the floodway is treated differently from that in the remaining portion of the area of special flood hazard proposals for development in the area of special flood hazard that are not in the floodway are reviewed only to ensure that development is protected against the base flood and need not be reviewed to determine their impact on flood heights because a floodway has already been designated proposals for development in the regulatory floodway are first reviewed for their cumulative impact on flood heights and are denied if flood levels would be raised if a technical evaluation clearly demonstrates that the cumulative impact of the proposal will not cause an increase in flood heights the proposal may be approved if the flood damage prevention standards of these regulations are otherwise met b coastal high hazard areas in all areas designated as coastal high hazard areas the following standards must be met 1 all new construction and substantial improvements of existing construction shall be located fifty 50 feet landward of the reach of the mean high tide 2 elevation a all new construction shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal member of the lowest floor excluding pilings or columns is located no lower than one 1 foot above the base flood elevation with all construction below the lowest supporting member open so as not to impede the flow of water b no fill shall be used as structural support noncompacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a structure for landscaping or aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from storm surge thereby rendering the structure free of obstruction prior to generating excessive loading forces ramping effects or wave deflection the director of community development shall approve design plans for landscapingaesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer architect andor soil scientist demonstrating that the foregoing criteria have been satisfied based upon the following considerations 1 the particle composition of the fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction 2 the volume and distribution of the fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties 3 the slope of the fill will not cause wave runup or ramping c the construction below the lowest floor shall be free of obstructions but may be enclosed with breakaway walls open wood lattice or insect screening designed to collapse under wind and water loads without causing collapse displacement or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the structure or supporting foundation system for the purposes of this section a breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten 10 and no more than twenty 20 pounds per square foot use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of no less than ten 10 and no more than twenty 20 pounds per square foot either by design or when so required by local or state codes may be permitted only if a registered engineer or architect certifies that the proposed design meets the following criteria 1 the breakaway wall will collapse under a water load less than the load imposed by the base flood  and 2 the elevated portion of the structure and supporting foundation system will not collapse be displaced or suffer structural damage from wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components structural and nonstructural wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall not be less than those that have a one 1 percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year one hundred 100 year mean recurrence interval d the space below the lowest floor shall be used only for parking of vehicles building access or storage of equipment used to maintain the premises 3 anchoring a all structures shall be securely anchored on pilings or columns b all pilings and columns and the attached structures shall be anchored to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement caused by wind and water loads acting

being equalled or exceeded in any given year one hundred 100 year mean recurrence interval 4 site alteration sand dunes and mangrove stands shall not be altered in a way that increases the potential for flood damage 5 certification a registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design specifications and plans for construction comply with the requirements of this section c standards for areas of shallow flooding the following standards apply to areas of shallow flooding located within the area of special flood hazard 1 residential structures the lowest floor of all new construction of and substantial improvements to residential structures shall be elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the firm at least two 2 feet if no depth number is specified 2 nonresidential structures the lowest floor of all new construction of and substantial improvements to nonresidential structures shall a be elevated as prescribed in section 14304c1 above  or b be constructed together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities so that any walls below the level prescribed in section 14304c1 above shall be substantially impermeable to the passage of water and any structural components below that level shall be capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy editors note these requirements are designed to maintain the flood water storage capacity of ponding areas or to prevent damming of sheet flow flood waters d standards for streams without established base flood
