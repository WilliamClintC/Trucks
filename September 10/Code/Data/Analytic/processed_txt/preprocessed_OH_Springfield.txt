is established in the city a stormwater utility to provide efficient and effective management and financing of a stormwater system within the city  to provide a system for mitigating the damaging effects of uncontrolled and unplanned stormwater runoff  to mitigate and reduce the amount of stormwater mixed with sanitary sewage and sent to the citys wastewater treatment facilities  to protect the public health safety and welfare by providing for the safe and efficient capture and conveyance of stormwater runoff for the correction of stormwater conditions detrimental to the public health safety and welfare  to authorize the establishment and implementation of plans and mechanisms for dealing with stormwater drainage including design coordination construction management operation maintenance and replacement of stormwater management facilities inspection and enforcement activities and administration of the citys stormwater utility  to establish reasonable stormwater utility service charges based on each propertys contribution of stormwater runoff to the system and use and benefit of services and facilities to fund the citys stormwater system  and to encourage and facilitate urban water resources management techniques including detention of stormwater runoff enhancing the amount of and use of permeable surfaces minimization of the need to construct storm sewers and the protection of the environment  bit is determined that the establishment of a stormwater utility is necessary to enable the city to comply with the unfunded mandates imposed on it under the federal clean water act and under requirements imposed on the city under the citys national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit  cit is determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to the protection of the public health safety welfare and necessary in order to accomplish the aforementioned purposes that a stormwater utility service charge shall be made on each lot or

building disposition this table approximates the location of the building relative to the boundaries of each individual lot each of these very general types is intrinsically more or less urban depending on the extent that it completes the frontage edgeyard specific types  single family house cottage villa estate house urban villa a building that occupies the center of its lot with setbacks on all sides this is the least urban of types as the front yard sets it back from the frontage while the side yards weaken the spatial definition of the public thoroughfare space the front yard is intended to be visually continuous with the yards of adjacent buildings the rear yard can be secured for privacy by fences and a wellplaced backbuilding and or outbuilding sideyard specific types  charleston single house double house zerolotline house and twin a building hat occupies one side of the lot with the setback to the other side a shallow frontage setback defines a more urban condition  if the adjacent building is similar with a blank side wall the yard can be 44d6add3338243bd6e46e58e04b0cc03821491e2 quite private this type permits systematic climatic orientation in response to images0003780jpg the sun or the breeze if a sideyard house abuts a neighboring sideyard house the type is known as a twin or double house energy costs and sometimes noise are reduced by sharing a party wall in this disposition rearyard specific types  townhouse rowhouse livework unit loft building apartment house mixed use block flex building perimeter block a building that ccupies the full frontage leaving the rear of the lot as the sole yard this is a very urban type as the continuous faade steadily defines the public thoroughfare the rear elevations may be articulated for functional purposes in its residential form this type is the rowhouse for its commercial form the rear yard can accommodate substantial parking courtyard specific types  patio house a building that occupies the boundaries of its lot while internally defining one or more private patios this is the most urban of types as it is able to shield the private realm from  all sides while strongly defining the public thoroughfare because of its 44d6add3338243bd6e46e58e04b0cc03821491e2 ability to accommodate incompatible activities masking them from all sides it images0003783jpg is recommended for workshops lodging

land is located shall be granted by the board unless it finds that strict application of this springfield zoning result in unnecessary hardship the board shall find unnecessary hardship only when all the following facts and conditions exist 1the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return if used only for a purpose allowed in the district to establish the inability of land to yield a reasonable return the owner must demonstrate factually by dollars and cents proof an inability to realize a reasonable return under existing permissible uses in the district an owner dose not suffer hardship sufficient to warrant the granting of a variance simply because the land would be more valuable or yield more profits if the variance were granted the requisite degree of hardship exists only when the only permissible uses are not economically feasible and strict application of the provisions or the springfield zoning the owner of economically viable use of the land 2the plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances and not to other general conditions in the neighborhood which may reflect the unreasonableness of the springfield zoning 3the use to be authorized by the variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood bno variance from the strict application of any provision of this springfield zoning does not involve the use of land which is prescribed or which will result in a use of land in a manner inconsistent with the basic character of the district in which such land is located shall be granted by the board unless it finds that strict application of this springfield zoning result in practical difficulties which will unreasonably deprive the owner of a permitted use of his property such area variances include by way of example and not of limitation relief from a set back requirement height requirement restrictions on the bulk of buildings the extent of lot coverage or yard requirements the board shall consider and weigh the following factors and such other factors as the board may determine have a bearing on finding whether strict application of any provision of this springfield zoning result in practical difficulties which will unreasonably deprive the owner of a permitted use of his property  however no one of such factors shall control in a determination of whether such practical difficulty exists 1the property in question cannot yield a reasonable return and there can be no beneficial use of the property without the variance the variance would relieve a clearly demonstrable situation where strict application of the provisions of this springfield zoning a practical difficulty that will deprive the owner of economically viable use of the land as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience to the owner 2the variance is not substantial 3the essential character of the neighborhood will not be substantially altered or suffer a substantial detriment as a result of the variance 4the variance will not adversely affect the delivery of governmental services such as police and fire protection water and sewer services and solid waste regulation and disposal 5the property owner purchased the property without knowledge of the zoning restrictions 6the property owners predicament feasibly can be obviated method other than granting a variance 7the property possesses conditions involving irregular narrow shallow or steep lots or other exceptional physical conditions and because of such exceptional physical conditions strict application of a provision or provisions of this springfield zoning be unreasonable 8the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement will be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance  117207 powers  exercise and extent in exercising its powers

requiring both public water supply and sanitary sewer system but which area does not contain one or both of these utilities at the time of development it is necessary that utility transition areas be confined to undeveloped areas adjacent to existing urban areas containing the needed utility services so that in due time these services will be available the provisions are made allowing a resubdivision of the original plat at a later date when utility lines are available so as to induce development in an economical manner and orderly arrangement rather than unsound scattered type of development  120702 provisions for transition areas abe platted in such a manner that in the future each lot may be split into two 2 or more parts each of which contains the necessary area and width

of the parts shall be identified by the letter a b etc each lot shall be sold as a unit and recorded on one deed such lots shall be restricted in use to one singlefamily residence it shall also be noted in the restrictions that at the time water and sanitary sewer lines are made available to any lot said lot may be split in two 2 or more parts if there is no existing dwelling so located on the lot that its required yards occupy portions of two 2 or more subsections the abovenoted restrictions of sale and use of land shall be specified in the deed and plat a sample set of subdivisions restrictions is listed in the reference manual located in the department of community development  bat such time as public water and sanitary sewer facilities are available to the aforementioned type
