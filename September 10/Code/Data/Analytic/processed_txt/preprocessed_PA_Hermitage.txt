3 the chemist or engineer engaged by the user may be present during the resampling and regauging operation and also in the wpcf laboratory during the chemical determination of the analysis 4 the results of the analysis determined from the quantity and quality of the flow shall be considered the analysis of the wastes discharged to the wpcf or to a watercourse by the user and the surcharge if applicable or penalties shall be determined from the strength of the wastes as reported in the analysis 5 in the event an analysis of wastes determined from the routinely scheduled sampling and

stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth and this city their resources and the environment 1 c stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality d federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes e public education is necessary for the proper understanding and implementation of stormwater management in the community in which it

uses of this commonwealth b manage the volume rate and quality of stormwater runoff c preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible d manage stormwater runoff as close to the source as possible e provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management f maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources g prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds from accelerated runoff h provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent swm bmps that are
