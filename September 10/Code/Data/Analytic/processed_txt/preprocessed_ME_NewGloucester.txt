of the town of new gloucester to encourage the use of open space subdivisions in order to preserve a sense of space provide for sustainable agriculture and forestry as well as recreational land preserve other resources identified in the town of new gloucester comprehensive plan and harmonize new development with the traditional open wooded agricultural rural and village landscapes of the town this performance standard is intended to implement that policy by providing incentives that afford flexibility to landowners in road and lot layout and design and road frontage requirements and by allowing the planning board to expedite procedure and to waive or reduce certain otherwise applicable standards and provisions of this zoning the subdivision regulations if such landowners commit to the permanent preservation of important open space resources these incentives are designed to encourage greater flexibility and more innovative approaches to housing and environmental design for the development of single and multifamily residential areas that will promote the most appropriate use of land and will preserve as permanent open space agricultural or forestry land important natural features wildlife habitat water resources ecological systems and historic and scenic areas for the benefit of present and future residents 2 purposes to qualify as an open space subdivision a subdivision must achieve those of the following purposes that are applicable to its specific circumstances a long term protection and conservation of existing natural and other resources and landscapes identified in the comprehensive plan the subdivision regulations and the zoning but not limited to 1 statedefined critical areas and unique natural features located on the parcel to be subdivided such as the black gum trees the sink hole and the red pines  2 historic land use patterns and historic structures  56 3 points of visual access to or from water bodies scenic vistas and points of access to water bodies  4 contiguous stands of mature trees  b maintenance or establishment of compatibility with surrounding land uses and the overall rural character of the town as defined by the comprehensive plan  c provision of adequate buffers for adjoining properties where needed  d contribution to townwide open space planning by creating a system of permanently preserved open space both within large parcels of land and among such parcels throughout the town and by encouraging linkages between open space areas  e conservation of land suitable or actively used for agriculture and forestry uses particularly where the open space subdivision borders active agricultural or forestry land or land suitable for the same  f conservation of traditional land uses  g creation of choices in the type of environment business or residential and type of housing available that will be a longterm asset to new gloucester  h construction of affordable housing  i provision of recreation facilities including active and passive recreational space in the most suitable locations for use consistent with the other purposes of this performance standard  and j attainment of planned variety and coordination in the location of structures architectural styles and building forms and relationships 3 types of open space subdivisions there are two types of open space subdivisions which may be used separately or in combination a cluster subdivisions a cluster subdivision achieves the purposes of this performance standard by reducing the lot size and frontage and setback requirements in the zoning modifying the road design standards of contained herein and clustering housing or business structures and uses in those areas where they will have the least impact on identified environmental and other open space resources these resources are then permanently preserved by the use of covenants and restrictions andor conservation easements that run with the land the cluster principle can be applied to subdivisions of any size 1 for all cluster subdivisions the identified environmental and other open space resources are then permanently preserved by the use of covenants and restrictions andor conservation easements that run with the land 57 2 cluster subdivisions utilizing transferable development rights are not required to permanently preserve the identified environmental and other open space resources however no further subdivision of the lots contained in the subdivision will be permitted at any time b conservation density subdivisions a conservation density subdivision achieves the purposes of this performance standard creation of significantly lower lot densities than what would be allowed in the applicable zoning district in no event may the density of such a subdivision average less than ten 10 acres including the land placed in open space for the parcel or portion of the parcel to be developed this low density is maintained in perpetuity use of permanent conservation easements or covenants and restrictions running with the land to encourage the establishment of these permanent low densities the planning board may expedite the review process provided that certain conditions are met 4 grouping contiguous parcels in order to increase design flexibility two or more contiguous parcels of land under the same or different ownership including parcels separated by a public or private road may be grouped together as one open space subdivision if the planning board finds that such grouping will benefit the town and will help to achieve the purposes set forth in subparagraph a2aj b planning board review an individual may apply for approval of an openspace subdivision either after preapplication review of a conventional subdivision or by initially filing an application for an open space subdivision in either case the planning board shall review the application in accordance with the subdivision regulations as modified by the provisions of this performance standard 1 preapplication procedure a any applicant for an open space subdivision including a multiplex development is encouraged but not required to submit at the preapplication stage a complete buildout plan for the entire parcel b after review of the preapplication if the planning board determines that an open space subdivision may meet the purposes set forth in subparagraph a2aj that are applicable to the proposed subdivision as well as other applicable provisions of this performance standard this zoning the subdivision regulations and the comprehensive plan the board shall encourage or permit as appropriate the applicant to proceed with an application for an open space subdivision c if a complete buildout plan for the parcel has been submitted the planning board shall encourage if appropriate consideration of longrange planning to make the most effective use of the design standards and timing mechanisms
