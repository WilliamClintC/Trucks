requirements a overview this section prescribes limitations and prohibitions on the quantity and quality of sewage or wastewater which may be lawfully discharged into the boards wastewater treatment system by any industrial user or other user pretreatment of some discharges may be required to achieve the goals established by the rules and regulations and the national pretreatment standards the specific limitations set forth herein and other prohibitions and limitations of the rules and regulations are subject to change as necessary to enable the board to 1 provide efficient wastewater

by the wvnpdes permit and the siu permits shall be modified to include the regulatory changes 2 national standards  as established by national pretreatment standards the limitations contained in those standards shall apply unless a more stringent standard has been established by the board or state certain significant industrial users are subject to national categorical standards promulgated by the us epa the epa may specify quantities or concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged into the boards wastewater treatment system all industrial users subject to a national pretreatment standard shall comply with all requirements of such standard and shall also comply with any additional or more stringent limitations contained in these rules and regulations existing sources subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard are subject to that categorical standard as soon as that standard is effective and must be in compliance with the categorical standard by the compliance date set within the standard new sources subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard already in effect must be in compliance with that standard as soon as discharge of wastewater from the new source commences except where expressly authorized by an applicable national pretreatment standard no industrial user shall increase the use of the process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitution for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with such standard 3 state limitations  state requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those contained in this chapter the board reserves the right to establish by rules and regulations more stringent limitations or requirements for discharges to a wastewater treatment facility if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives stated at the beginning of this chapter d construction and interpretation the omission of any particular waste from the standards outlined in the rules and regulations does not imply that discharge of such waste to the sanitary sewer system will be permitted any liquid waste of peculiar character and volume or of toxic or unusual nature shall be subject to review by the board and standards deemed applicable established by the board the requirements as set forth by the rules and regulations are generally applicable but not absolutely fixed such requirements may be made more restrictive and more stringent by the board if a survey of the sewer system andor analyses of wastewater treatment plant operating data or standards set by the west virginia dep for receiving streams indicate that such action is necessary for the protection of the sewerage system e acceptance of trucked or hauled pollutants and septic tank wastes industrial waste nondomestic waste domestic waste or pollutants from sites not served by the public sewerage system may be considered for disposal on a case by case basis any person requesting such disposal shall first obtain a waste haulers permit from the board a separate request must be made for each discharge unless it can be demonstrated that the wastes are routinely produced and of such quality that individual consideration can be waived the permit issued to haulers of industrial waste nondomestic waste domestic waste or pollutants shall be subject to all the provisions of the industrial waste discharge permit the conditions of the waste haulers permit may include but not be limited to the following 1 maximum permissible composite concentration of wastewater constituents  2 limits on rate and time of discharge or requirements for flow regulation  3 requirements for inspection and sampling  4 requirements for recording maintaining and reporting information concerning the origin of each tank truck load and identification of contributors  5 prohibition of discharge

likely to cause interference with the wastewater treatment system serving the industrial user shall notify the board immediately by telephone 2 written report within five 5 days following such occurrence the industrial user shall provide the board with a detailed written report describing the cause of the accidental discharge or slug load and corrective measures taken by the industrial user such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense loss or damage to the boards wastewater treatment system fish kills or any other damage to person or property  nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines or other liability which may be imposed by the rules and regulations or other applicable law the written report shall specify a description of the discharge or slug load the causes thereof and the discharges or slug loads impact on the industrial users noncompliance status  b duration of noncompliance including exact dates and times of noncompliance and if the noncompliance continues the time by which compliance is reasonably expected to occur  c all steps taken or to be taken to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of such discharge slug load or other conditions of noncompliance a documented and verified accidental discharge or slug load shall be an affirmative defense to any enforcement action brought against the industrial user for violations attributable to the upset event 3 notice to employees a notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial users bulletin board or other prominent location advising employees whom to call in the event of accidental discharge or slug load employers shall ensure that all employees who would be responsible to make calls and take appropriate actions if such an accidental discharge or slug load were to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure d right of entry the board reserves the right to inspect the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the provisions of the rules and regulations are being met and all requirements are being complied with the industrial user shall allow authorized board representatives upon the presentation of credentials 1 to have ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the industrial user premises for purposes of inspection andor sampling in the performance of any of their duties  2 to sample or monitor at reasonable times for the purposes of assuring compliance with the rules and regulations any substances or parameters at any location  3 inspect any production manufacturing fabricating or storage area where pollutants could originate where the industrial user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification personnel from the board will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities unreasonable delays shall be deemed a violation of the users permit and can result in penalties subject to the provisions contained in section 97d e reporting of hazardous waste 1 all industrial users must notify the board the epa regional waste management division director and the west virginia division of waste management in writing of any discharge into the potw of a substance which if otherwise disposed of would be a hazardous waste under 40 cfr the written notification must include a the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 cfr b the epa hazardous waste number c the type of discharge continuous batch or other 2 if the industrial user discharges more than one hundred 100 kilograms of

waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve 12 months 3 all notifications shall take place no later than one hundred eighty 180 days after the discharge of the hazardous waste any notification under this section need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged however notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 cfr 40312j 4 users are exempt from the requirements of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 cfr 26130d and 26133e discharge of more than fifteen 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 cfr 26130d and

and regulations b principles of the enforcement response plan the beckley sanitary board enforcement response plan has been developed based on information contained in the usepa guidance for developing control authority enforcement response plans the plan is based on the following basic principles 1 source inventory  the beckley sanitary board maintains a complete and accurate source inventory the inventory contains appropriate basic information concerning each discharger such as name location permit number discharge limit compliance dates and other permit requirements and effluent data the pretreatment coordinator maintains the inventory using the industrial user inventory form the pretreatment coordinator will review industrial users semiannually to update the list of significant industrial users in addition pretreatment coordinator will maintain and update the master file of industrial users this file shall consist of industrial waste survey forms and permit applications for all industrial users the industrial waste survey form shall be considered updated for permitted users when the initial permit application is submitted and then renewed every three 3 years for industrial users who are not permitted the pretreatment coordinator or his designee shall update the industrial waste survey form every five 5 years in addition the general manager or his designee shall monitor the building permits issued on a monthly basis to detect possible changes in processes that are unreported by industrial users the information will be made available to appropriate local state and federal officials 2 information flow  any information obtained from the discharger or other governmental agencies will be collected and disseminated in an orderly efficient manner the pretreatment coordinator is responsible for the repository for all the information requests for information shall be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator in writing a response to the request for information will be provided within thirty 30 days of the request for information j deals with confidential information 3 preenforcement screening  the preenforcement screening is accomplished by reviewing information as soon as it is received the pretreatment coordinator will evaluate user discharge monitoring reports to determine required enforcement actions within five 5 days of receipt using the compliance screening checklist for monitoring reports the pretreatment coordinator will maintain a log of due dates for all reports d identifies the steps that will be taken if noncompliance is identified in addition to the above procedures to identify noncompliance the pretreatment coordinator will track previous noncompliance d also identifies the steps that will be taken if noncompliance is continued 4 formal enforcement evaluation  once the need for an enforcement response has been determined by the preenforcement screening the selection of an appropriate initial action will be based on the enforcement responses identified in section 97d 5 formal enforcement action and followup  the enforcement measuresactivities available to the board are described in section 97 the range of appropriate responses is described in section 97d the general manager will monitor each enforcement action being pursued d contains time frames in which action will be taken against noncomplying significant industrial users c discusses the board officials who will take actions indicated in enforcement responses set forth in section 97d 6 demand monitoring and inspections  demand sampling and industrial inspections are usually performed in response to a complaint or an emergency situation in addition demand sampling and inspections will be initiated if board personnel notice changes in the influent characteristics of the potw any discharge that reasonably appears to present an imminent endangerment to health or safety of the public or board personnel or appears to be causing interference or pass the potw will be considered as an emergency situation if board personnel determine that an emergency condition exists appropriate additional board personnel will be notified so that steps can be taken to minimize the impact of the emergency condition board personnel will conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the emergency condition using information on file an attempt to identify the likely sources of the discharge casing the emergency condition will be made if necessary board personnel will visit the location of the suspected discharge to conduct an inspection and sampling the objective of the inspection and sampling is to determine the nature duration and hazard of the discharge  obtain samples to verify the source and constituents of the discharge  ascertain the necessary corrective actions needed to be taken to contain or halt the discharge  initiate corrective action if needed  document information needed for followup compliance or enforcement activities once the source of the discharge causing the emergency condition is identified the procedures identified in the ordinance will be followed 7 periodic erp evaluation  the effectiveness of the enforcement response plan will be assessed on an annual basis as part of the yearly report submitted to the dep c responsible board officials board officials who will take actions indicated in enforcement responses set forth below are as follows 1 issuance of notice of violation nov will be done by the general manager or his designees 2 issuance of administrative compliance
