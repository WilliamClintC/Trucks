neshaminylittle neshaminy stormwater management   2882 statement of findings the governing body of the municipality finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety b inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens c a comprehensive program of stormwater management swm including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment d stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  2881 general provisions  2883   2883 purpose the purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health safety and welfare within the neshaminy

of the bentonite must be delayed until bentonite mix has been placed down the well this can be done by using additives with the dry bentonite or in water  mixing calcium bentonite with sodium bentonite or by using granular bentonite which has less surface area  in all well installations if rapid loss of grout material occurs during placement coarse fill material eg sand gravel crushed stone dry cement may be used in the zone or zones in which the rapid loss is occurring the remainder of the annular space shall be grouted as provided below in no case shall pouring dumping or shoveling of grout material into the annular space be deemed an approved method of grout placement 3 grout placement a grout pipe outside casing  the minimum annular space of 1 12 inches around the entire outside of the casing shall be provided by drilling a bore hole three inches larger than the outside diameter of the casing to be inserted all grout shall be placed by pumping grout pipe the entire interval to be grouted shall be open and without obstructions washing or jetting with water is recommended for cleaning the bore hole and may serve to remove obstructions caused by casing which otherwise would prevent a proper grout it is recommended that the grout pipe extend from the surface to the bottom of the interval to be grouted the grout pipe may remain extended to the bottom of the interval during and after grouting or it may be raised slowly as a grout is placed provided that the discharge end of the grout pipe remains submerged in the emplaced grout at all times until grouting is completed in the event of interruption in the grouting operations the bottom of the grout pipe shall be raised above the grout level and should not be resubmerged until the air and water have been displaced from the grout pipe  grouting depths greater than 30 feet the minimum length of grout pipe shall be inserted into the annular space is 30 feet  grouting depths of 30 feet and less grout may be placed by a tremie pipe inserted only a short distance approximately five feet into the annular space provided that the entire interval to be grouted is clearly visible from the surface and is dry an annular space larger than the  3536 general provisions  3536  minimum 1 12 inches may be required to assure visibility from the surface b grout pipe inside casing the bottom of the casing is fitted with a packer arrangement also referred to as a cementing shoe or float shoe and the casing is placed in the bore hole a short distance off the bottom the float shoe allows grout to be pumped grout pipe and upward into the annular space while preventing grout leakage into the casing during grouting and after removal of grout pipe grouting is continued until cement appears at the surface at which time the grout pipe is disconnected from the float shoe the float shoe is drilled out after the grout sets and hardens sufficiently c interior method two plug the first plug separates the grout from the fluid in the casing and the other separates the grout from the water pumped in above it first the casing is placed a short distance off the bottom after pumping water casing to circulate fluid in the annular space and clear any obstructions from the hole the first plug is inserted and the casing is capped a measured volume of grout is pumped in which is sufficient to fill the annular space the casing then is opened and the second plug inserted a measured volume of water is pumped in above the second plug until it is pushed to the bottom of the casing and most of the grout is expelled up and into the annual space the water in the casing is held under pressure to prevent the backflow of grout until it has set and hardened d interior method upper plug the casing is placed a short distance off the bottom and the water is pumped into the casing to circulate fluid annular space to clear any obstructions from the hole a measured quantity of grout slightly greater than that needed to fill the annular space is pumping into the capped casing because this grout is in direct contact with the drilling fluid there will be a narrow zone of weak grout between the drilling fluid and good grout  however this zone should remain inside the casing and not be forced into the annular space the casing is opened and a drillable plug is inserted a measured volume of water is pumped in above the plug until it is pushed to the bottom of the casing and most of the grout is expelled up and into the annular space the water in the casing is held under pressure until the grout sets and hardens e interior method capped casing the casing is placed a short distance off the bottom and water is pumped into the casing to circulate fluid in the annular space and clear any obstructions from the hole the grout pipe passes airtight cap at the top of the casing and is positioned three to four feet above the bottom of the casing the grout pipe is assembled so that it  3536 warrington code  3536  can be pulled cap a distance of about 20 feet after the injection of grout is completed a bleeder valve is provided to release air from inside the casing as it is filled with water the first step is to fill the casing and annular space with water with the upper end of the casing closed grouting is started by forcing the cement grout pipe upward into the annular space grouting is continued until the cement overflows around the casing at ground surface just enough water is pumped to clear the cement from the grout pipe and the grout pipe is lifted free of the grout both the casing and grout pipe shall be kept tightly closed under pressure until the cement sets and hardens f grout displacement method the hole is filled with the estimated volume of grout required to fill the annular space and the casing is lowered into the hole the bottom of the casing is closed in a tight drillable plug guides often are used to keep the casing centered in the hole as the casing is lowered the grout is forced upward around it to fill the annular space if the pipe does not sink to the bottom under its own weight it is filled with water g unconsolidated formations when drilling unconsolidated formation a steel drive shoe shall be required grouting shall be done in accordance with the following  if caving conditions are experienced on wells deeper than 30 feet the annular space shall be grouted from the point where caving occurred or from a depth of 30 feet whichever is greater to land surface  if the annular space cannot be grouted in accordance with these regulations the well shall be abandoned and sealed in accordance with  3539 of this article h other grouting methods and materials may be used subject to prior written approval of the department 4 packers packers when used
