buildings existing and future facing and gaining access from public streets as defined in kpb  this chapter only applies to the rural district in the borough addressing systems adopted by the incorporated cities within the borough are recognized and are not altered by this chapter  31406  part 1992   addressing authority the mayor or designee shall cause the initial assignment of addresses  31406  part 1992   address defined the term address as used in this chapter means a logical number assigned to houses and buildings in sequential order along streets as defined in serving as a distinct physical location for responding to an emergency and delivery of other public and private services part 1992   addressing system a numbering of addresses shall be based on a uniformly numbered grid system emanating in four quadrants from the primary northsouth and eastwest base lines described as follows 1 the northsouth base line is the line common to ranges 4 and 5 west of the seward principal meridian alaska 2 the eastwest base line is the line common to townships 1 north and 1 south being the seward base line alaska 3 the seward principal meridian and the seward base line are defined by the united states rectangular survey system b the numerical values of the grid system shall be ordered as follows 1 the primary base lines are assigned the value of 10000 2 at each mile distant in cardinal directions from the base lines the grid is incremented by the value of 1000 ie a location that is 5 miles north of the eastwest base line bears the grid address of north 15000 and a location that is 20 miles east of the northsouth base line bears the grid address of east 20000 3 there being 1000 numbers to each mile provides the means to accurately establish an individual address for houses and buildings within a tolerance of 528 feet for example a house that is located on an eastwest street 2350 feet westerly of grid mile west 33000 would be correctly addressed by the formula 2350  52801000   445 + 33000   33445 thus 33445 is the correct address for that location on any eastwest street west of the primary northsouth base line c individual addresses shall be assigned using the following conventions 1 if there is constructed access to the property the number shall be assigned based upon the street to which access to the property has been constructed if access has not been constructed or if it has been constructed to more than one street then the address shall be determined using the street most directly faced by the main entrance to the primary improvement on the property if the property is not improved and no access has been constructed then the address will be determined using the street to which the property has the most frontage in any event if the access crosses another parcel with no dedicated rightofway the property owner must provide a copy of a recorded easement or proof thereof to receive a number based upon the street to which access has been constructed 2 houses and buildings on the northerly and easterly sides of streets shall have even numbers 3 houses and buildings on the southerly and westerly sides of streets shall have odd numbers 4 houses and buildings on corner lots shall have an address determined primarily by the location of the main constructed access to a street 5 apartment houses with a common entrance shall have one address 6 buildings with multiple entrances by one common address point shall have an individual address for each individual primary entrance per parcel the owner may assign additional sequential letters or other identifiers in accordance with postal addressing standards for each primary entrance d curvilineal or winding streets and loop streets not conforming to the cardinal grid shall be addressed according to the following 1 the initial and thereafter the dominant direction of the street shall control which axis of the grid will be used to calculate the beginning number 2 the addresses shall be numbered sequentially along the street based on the distance from the initial address regardless of change in direction 3 individual addresses shall be assigned according to the convention under kpb c  31406  part 1992   preexisting addresses notwithstanding the provisions of section  those addresses which have been previously established by a nonofficial agency and which have been posted recognized and serve as adequate locational numbers shall be officially adopted to the extent possible part 1992   remote communitiesvillages a there are unincorporated communities and villages within the borough that are separated from the major populated area by a major topographic feature or distance it is recognized that the grid system defined under kpb  may not be practicable or necessary for those remote locations b for remote areas the address shall consist of a number assigned from the grid in which the property primarily lies followed by the name of the general location if there is a name if there is no such name then the us survey number shall be used instead this name or number shall be followed by the quadrant within which the property is primarily located and the address shall end with the term rem c upon consideration of local concerns future expansion public safety and delivery of services the planning commission may establish a local system more suitable for the area using the following general guidelines 1 if the layout of existing streets and topography is such that a local grid system is practicable the axis of the grid should be established at a location which allows all addresses to lie in one quadrant of the grid 2 in the absence of an acceptable grid system an incremental numbering system may be employed for each individual street with the addresses emanating from an appropriate major thoroughfare 3 there should be 1000 numbers per mile similar to kpb b3 d all other provisions of this chapter shall apply regardless of what address system is adopted  31406  part 1992   notification of address upon completion of the initial assignment of addresses and thereafter upon assignment of a new address the mayor or designee shall provide notification of the assigned address to the owner or occupant in a timely and appropriate manner part 1992   address posting the owners occupants or other persons having responsibility for the houses and buildings to be addressed shall obtain and display in a prominent manner the correct numbers corresponding to the assigned address in accordance with the following a the numbers should be a minimum of three inches in height and should be made of a durable reflective and clearly visible material which will provide a distinct contrast to the background on which the numbers are posted b the numbers should be posted as near the entrance to the house or building as possible and affixed in a legible manner which is visible from the street c in the case of long driveways andor the presence of vegetation or other sight barriers which block the view of the structure from the street the numbers should be placed on durable fixtures such as gates or fence posts at or near the driveway entrance a tree may also serve this purpose d failure to post the numbers shall constitute a full and final release of liability from any and all claims

additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 6 exceptions or variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants or to economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such exceptions from the flood elevations should be quite rare 7 exceptions may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryflood

that the uncontrolled use and pollution of shoreland and riparian areas adversely affects the prosperity of the kenai peninsula borough the public health safety convenience and general welfare and impairs the tax base d the assembly finds that the legislature of alaska authorizes the borough to provide for planning platting and land use regulation as  planning platting and land use regulation states in subsection a that a first or second class borough shall provide for planning platting and land use regulation on an areawide basis e the assembly finds that the riparian ecosystem includes stream bank and floodplain areas and recognizes that impacts to anadromous waters may be due to activities and uses within the greater watershed f the assembly finds that the 1997 update of the alaska
