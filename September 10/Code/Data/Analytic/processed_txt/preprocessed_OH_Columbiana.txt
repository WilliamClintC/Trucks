uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises

other establishments 3sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses 6at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and

and from an infected mother to her newborn 11according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts 12sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 13numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 14the findings noted in divisions 1 13 raise substantial governmental concerns 15sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 16a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the municipality it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 17removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 18requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 19the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 20in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct 21the fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 22the barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases 23the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the municipality will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter o1888 passed 5152001  86802 definitions as used in this chapter certain terms are defined as

natural gas aggregation program the aggregation program in compliance with ohio rc 492926 under the optout natural gas aggregation program all eligible natural gas consumers within the citys corporation limits will be automatically included in the aggregation program initially however all consumers will also be given the opportunity to optout or decline participation in the aggregation program as detailed herein bthe citys purpose in creating the aggregation program is to represent local consumer interests in emerging competitive natural gas markets by aggregating natural gas loads within the citys corporation limits including municipal facilities and negotiating affordable reliable natural gas supplies and other related services on behalf of local consumers the city may pursue this purpose individually or in cooperation with other entities cmany small commercial and residential natural gas consumers lack the leverage to effectively negotiate natural gas supply rates and services a governmental aggregation program provides them with an option for professional representation and the bargaining power of a larger more diverse consumer group that may be more attractive to suppliers allowing them to effectively participate in the competitive process and achieve benefits o2198 passed 672005  104602 description of services athe aggregation program is designed to reduce the amount a consumer pays for natural gas energy and to gain other favorable economic and non economic terms in service contracts the city will not buy and resell natural gas but will represent collective consumer interests to set terms and conditions for service through a negotiation process the city will develop a contract with a competitive retail natural gas services provider crngs provider or providers for firm allrequirements natural gas service once the contract has been finalized it will be submitted to the columbiana city council for approval bthe aggregation program covers the natural gas supply portion only of a participants natural gas bill columbia gas of ohio coh will continue to deliver natural gas to aggregation program participants homes and businesses natural gas distribution system as a monopoly function regulated by the public utilities commission of ohio puco coh will also continue to install operate and maintain its system of pipelines rightsofway meters and other natural gas distribution components aggregation program participants should continue to call coh if their natural gas is interrupted or if they have billing questions the puco will continue to oversee coh natural gas safety and reliability service standards coversight of the aggregation program will be the responsibility of the city manager who shall report to the city council the city manager subject to city council approval will have the authority to develop specifications for the aggregation program to appoint an aggregation program manager and to select hire and manage the crngs provider the crngs provider and the aggregation program manager will work under the direction of the city manager with the advice and counsel of the city attorney ddue to the complexity of the natural gas utility industry and the uncertainties of its associated restructuring activities the city of columbiana may contract with a consultant or consultants to provide the necessary expertise to represent the citys interest in legislative and regulatory matters andor to serve as the aggregation program manager such services may include but are not limited to facilitating consumer enrollment and optout assisting with consumer education addressing consumer questions and concerns providing reports on program operation enrollment and savings negotiating future crngs provider contracts and representing the city in dealings with crngs providers coh the ohio legislature the puco and the ohio consumers counsel occ ethe city deems any and all information related to an eligible customer to be confidential and proprietary trade secret information the crngs provider shall keep all eligible customer information provided to it by the city or coh in supplying eligible customers within the citys corporation limit confidential and shall not disclose such information to any third party unless such disclosure is required to serve any eligible customer the third party agrees to keep such eligible customer information confidential and the city consents to the disclosure of such information to the third party fthe city will require any crngs provider to disclose any subcontractors that it uses in fulfillment of the services described herein gthe crngs provider will provide a local or toll free telephone number for participant questions and concerns about enrollment optout provisions billing and other aggregation program issues hthe crngs provider will develop internal controls and processes to help ensure that the city remains in good standing as a governmental aggregator that complies with all laws rules and regulations regarding the same as they may be periodically amended inatural gas service reliability is an essential to aggregation program participants the city will strive to provide highquality service and reliability of the crngs provider contract proceedings related to coh distribution services  and discussions with coh concerning specific or general problems related to quality and reliability of its distribution system jif for any reason a crngs provider fails to provide uninterrupted service the city will attempt to acquire an alternative natural gas supply if this attempt fails participants will default to coh established tariff rates in no case will participants be without natural gas as the result of the crngs providers failure to provide uninterrupted service the city will seek to minimize this risk by contracting only with reputable crngs providers that demonstrate reliable service the city also intends to include conditions in its crngs provider contract that will indemnify participants against risks or problems with natural gas supply service and price kall aggregation program participants shall
