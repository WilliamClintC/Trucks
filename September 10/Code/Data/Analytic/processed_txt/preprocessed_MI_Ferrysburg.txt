roadways structures and other property within and downstream of the city are potentially subject to flooding  b flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the public and is also a danger to the natural resources of the city and the region  c land development alters the hydrologic response of watersheds resulting in increased storm water runoff rates and volumes increased flooding increased stream channel erosion and increased sediment transport and deposition  d storm water runoff produced by land development contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants  e increases of storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution have occurred as a result of land development and cause deterioration of the water resources of the city and downstream municipalities  f storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution due to land development within the city have resulted in a deterioration of the water resources of the city and downstream municipalities  g increased storm water runoff rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with storm water runoff from future development projects within the city will absent reasonable regulation and control adversely affect the citys water bodies and water resources and those of downstream municipalities  h storm water runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized by the regulation of storm water runoff from development  i adopting the standards criteria and procedures contained in this chapter and implementing the same will address many of the deleterious effects of storm water runoff  and therefore j adopting these standards is necessary for the preservation of the public health safety and welfare passed 9506  15803 purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum storm water management requirements and controls to accomplish among others the following objectives a to reduce artificially induced flood damage  b to minimize increased storm water runoff rates and volumes from identified new land development  c to minimize the deterioration of existing watercourses culverts and bridges and other structures  d to encourage water recharge into the ground where geologically favorable conditions exist  e to prevent an increase in nonpoint source pollution  f to maintain the integrity of stream channels for their biological functions as well as for drainage and other purposes  g to minimize the impact of development upon stream bank and stream bed stability  h to reduce erosion from development or construction projects  i to preserve and protect water supply facilities and water resources by means of controlling increased flood discharges stream erosion and runoff pollution  j to reduce storm water runoff rates and volumes soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution wherever practicable from lands that were developed without storm water management controls meeting the purposes and standards of this chapter  k to reduce the adverse impact of changing land use on water bodies and to that end this chapter establishes minimum standards to protect water bodies from degradation resulting from changing land use where there are insufficient storm water management controls  and l to establish legal authority to carry out all inspection surveillance monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter passed 9506  15804 applicability exemptions and general provisions a this chapter shall apply to any development which requires approval of a site plan by the

industries which are primarily light manufacturing in character and do not create an adverse impact on the environment or pose the probability of creating a heavy demand on public services or utilities to ensure that the uses may be properly integrated with nearby land uses such as commercial and residential uses limitations are placed on the degree of acceptable noise smoke glare waste and other impacts so as to avoid adverse effects the light industrial district also recognizes certain industrial locations which according to the city master plan are proposed for eventual transition to nonindustrial use the li light industrial district is divided into three 3 subcategories 1 li1 industrial district  li1 is defined as wholesale warehousing and manufacturing uses and facilities whose external effects eg noise vibration odor smoke heat etc have minimal or no detrimental effect on surrounding properties and zone districts li1 districts permit the manufacturing compounding processing packaging assembly andor treatment of finished or semifinished products from previously prepared material this district provides opportunity to locate a limited range of industrial uses within close proximity of areas experiencing residential and commercial growth the spatial orientation of the li1 district is based on the potential for identified locations to support a select range of industrial uses as well as the historic development of lands so designated due to the proximity of li1 sites to nonindustrial development the range of uses is however limited in scope certain compatible commercial uses are also provided for in the li1 district 2 li2 district  li2 is defined as manufacturing assembly and fabrication activities including large scale or specialized industrial operations whose external effects eg noise vibration odor smoke glare etc have greater potential to be feltexperienced by surrounding land uses and zone districts when compared to li1 uses these effects have a potential to be detrimental to surrounding properties unless carefully regulated li2 uses include but are not limited to many of the uses provided for within the li1 district as well as the manufacturing processing andor compounding of finished or semifinished products from raw materials this district is located in close proximity to the us31 freewayvanwagoner road interchange in addition to the buffering effect of these major road systems the li2 district is segregated from areas of higher density development as a result of extensive wetlands bordering the southern and westerly sides of the district the isolation of the li2 district from nonindustrial uses affords greater opportunity to support a larger more diverse range of industrial development certain compatible districts and district standards city of ferrysburg adopted   amended 317 917 commercial uses are also provided for in the li2 district while both districts provide for many of the same land uses their individual location and site characteristics offer opportunity to focus a select number of specific uses unique to each subcategory 3 li3 district  this is a transitional industrial district the district recognizes the preexistence of historic industrial development on sites likely to experience a transition to nonindustrial use over time the transitional character of li3 district locations is recognized as such by the city master plan due to their relatively large size location and general relationship to surrounding development li3 district sites do not exhibit the general characteristics of spot zones uses programmed for the li3 district include preexisting industrial development and a range of nonindustrial transitional uses b principal permitted uses  li1 and li2 1
