the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 1996 sec  of purpose it is the purpose of his article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control

educational and shopping facilities to serve the residents of the neighborhood should be provided and designed as an integral part of each neighborhood the size of lots and blocks should be designed to provide for adequate water and wastewater service traffic circulation light air open space landscaping and offstreet parking the arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be designed to make the most advantageous use of topography and natural physical features tree masses and large individual trees should be preserved to the greatest extent possible the system of sidewalks and roadways and the lot layout should be designed to take advantage of the visual qualities of the area 2 the components of the street system should in different degrees serve the separate purposes of access to property and safe efficient movement of traffic land use types should be served by roadways whose capacity increases in proportion to the traffic generation of the land use design and location of points of access to property should be appropriate to the volume and speed characteristics of traffic utilizing the intersection 3 an open space system throughout the urban area should provide a range of active and passive recreation opportunities park open space and recreation facilities should be located with sensitivity to user population natural features traffic generation and nearby land use 4 land use arrangement and design should minimize the difference in intensity between adjacent uses in order to provide for the provision of water wastewater and roadways sufficient to serve the proposed densities and provide for compatible neighboring developments stepdown patterns of use surrounding major activity centers combined with buffering techniques should ensure that residential densities are compatible with each other and that residential development is not adversely impacted by higher intensity uses 5 public utilities and infrastructure should be provided within all subdivisions in order to ensure the health safety and wellbeing of the public utility capacity should be sufficient to meet accepted standards of service to reasonably

existing water conservation policies and increase its emphasis on water conservation measures to accomplish the goals presented below the city goals with respect to water conservation are to 1 reduce unaccountedfor water to ten 10 percent water use accounting and leak detection and repair by the year 2015 2 reduce the per capita per day consumption by ten 10 percent from a fouryear average of 130 gpcd to 110 gpcd by the year 2015 3 continue the meter testing repair and replacement program as well as leak detection efforts in order to reduce the unaccountedfor water to ten 10 percent as stated above b these goals are consistent with commonly accepted industry standards and with the expected water conservation effects included in state water development board twdb water demand projections for the city 5a ex a sec i adopted  conservation program the following actions will be taken by the city to accomplish the abovestated goals 1 public education and awareness a public education and awareness is an essential component of the citys water conservation program the objective is to communicate to the citys residents the need for and benefits of water conservation and to provide useful consumeroriented information on water conservation practices and technologies the city will obtain and disseminate such information variety of avenues including i providing water conservation literature to new utility customers at the time they apply for service to utility customers reporting high water use and at the utility sales office on a continuing basis  ii providing publicity of the use of native plants and grasses to reduce lawn water demands  iii providing consumer tips on water conservation in a newsletter to be posted at all water offices and to be distributed at civic events  and iv presentation at schools and to civic organizations b the city will also obtain video and radio public service announcements on water conservation from the twdb and make these available to the local media twdb videos on state water resources issues and water conservation will also be provided to the public access channel c the city will also explore opportunities to implement the major rivers youth education program major rivers is a water education curriculum designed to teach 4th and 5th grade students about the states major water resources how water is treated and delivered to their    396508 homes and schools how to care for their water resources and how to use them wisely the programs host major rivers named for the major rivers of texas and his horse aquifer cover these topics in eight lessons that include a variety of activities in science math language arts social studies and other subjects the major rivers teaching package includes a teachers guide with fullcolor overhead transparencies an introductory video and fullcolor student workbooks and home information leaflets the lesson objectives not only define important knowledge and skills related to water but they also support many of the state education agencys teks and taks objectives for social studies science language arts and math the cost of the program is approximately $4000 per 30student classroom the city will work with the school district businesses and civic organizations to obtain funding to implement the program 2 plumbing fixture efficiency standards a since 199 state law has prohibited the sale of certain plumbing fixtures that do not conform to specific water use efficiency standards for example water use by tanktype toilets sold within the state is not to exceed 16 gallons per flush shower heads are limited to 25 gallons per minute flow rate similar water efficiency standards have been adopted by the federal government these state and federal water efficiency standards effectively supersede and replace local standards and eliminate the need for enforcement of plumbing code standards for water efficiency at the local level b in 199 the state legislature passed legislation requiring that plumbing fixtures sold in the state after  meet the following standards i shower heads no more than 275 gallons per minute at 80 pounds per square inch of pressure ii laboratorysink faucets and aerators no more than 22 gallons per minute at 60 pounds per square inch of pressure iii wallmounted flushometer toilets no more than 20 gallons per flush iv all other toilets no more than 16 gallons per flush v drinking water fountains must be self closing the above standards are enforced placed directly on the manufacturers importers and supplies of new fixtures in the state c in addition the city encourages the following water conservation measures i hot water pipes hot water lines not in or under a concrete slab installed shall be insulated ii pressure reduction valves pressure reduction valves may be installed where system pressures exceed 80 pounds per square inch iii swimming pools swimming pools should have recirculating filtration equipment iv automatic dishwashers automatic dishwashers installed in residential dwellings should be a design that uses a maximum of six gallons of water per cycle v automatic clothes washers automatic clothes washers installed in residential dwellings should be a design that uses a maximum of 14 gallons of water per cycle    397508 d new plumbing fixtures that replace or renovate existing plumbing fixtures should follow the residential and commercial construction requirements e the use of waterefficient plumbing fixtures in new construction and as replacements in existing construction is expected to significantly reduce per capita water use and wastewater flows over time importantly such savings will occur passively in that market penetration will occur as a consequence of new development and as older inefficient plumbing fixtures wear out and are replaced also water savings associated with highefficiency plumbing fixtures are relatively predictable as the savings are not dependent on conscious effort by the consumer to modify water use behaviors the citys plumbing code encourages the use of waterconserving plumbing fixtures for residential and commercial construction the city has adopted the 2000 international plumbing 3 plumbing fixture retrofit and replacement the city will encourage the retrofit andor replacement of older inefficient plumbing fixtures and appliances public education and awareness activities described above particular emphasis will be placed on the expected cost savings and payback periods water wastewater and energy costs also as previously indicated retrofit kits will be provided major rivers program in addition the city will investigate the costs and benefits of replacing inefficient plumbing fixtures in all cityowned facilities 4 water rate structure the schedule of monthly rates or charges for water service furnished by the city shall be and such is hereby adopted and established as set forth in the fee schedule in appendix a of this code 5a ex a sec ii adopted  5 metering and repair a metering all water services is an effective means of improving and maintaining control of water system operations and provides the basis for efficient and equitable cost recovery metering provides a database for system performance monitoring for planning future facilities and for assessing the effects of water conservation measures metering also improves accountability for both water deliveries and for unaccountedfor water losses the city meters all water accounts including those serving city facilities b the city meters the quantity of water that is delivered to each residential and commercial customer and to each public use including city facilities meters are read and the quantities are recorded once per month with billings made monthly to residential and commercial customers efforts are on the way to implement some type of automatic meter reading amr to remove the human factor in the reading of meters and thus reduce unaccounted for water ufw c periodic testing repair andor changeout of meters is essential to an effective metering program all meters larger than two 2 inches are tested by the city annually and meters one and onehalf 112 inches and smaller are tested on a cycle of once every five 5 years meters found to perform outside accepted parameters for accuracy will be repaired or replaced as required d the city meters all water sales and public uses and operates a meter replacement program with the objective to replace 15 percent of residential meters per year and a goal to replace all residential meters every 7 to 8 years all commercial meters are tested annually and replaced as necessary the city plans to continue this program e the city has instituted procedures to improve accounting for unmetered water losses resulting from the flushing of water mains firefighting and main breaks these procedures    398508 allow the city to better estimate actual water losses due to leakage and will aid in evaluating the cost and benefits associated with leak detection and the repair or replacement of main water lines 6 waterconserving landscaping the city does not plan to require waterconserving landscaping however the city does education and awareness activities encourage residents to adopt waterefficient landscaping and landscape maintenance practices through its public information program the city encourages and supports the use of xeriscape landscaping techniques utilities staff distribute xeriscape literature and provide presentations at public meetings on waterconserving landscaping and lawn watering methods particular emphasis is placed on providing such information in advance of and during the summer lawn water season 7 reuse the city does not reuse treated wastewater effluent 8 pressure reduction pressure is the force which determines how much water can pass given faucet valve pipe or hole in a given time for example test for one type of faucet showed that flow rates faucet opened at a constant setting varied from 30 to 56 gallons per minute at 150 psi from this example it is obvious that pressure reduction will help save water by reducing the amount of water that will flow opened valve or faucet in a given time period pressure reduction also saves water by reducing excessive mechanical stress on plumbing fixtures and appliances and on distribution systems faucet seats and washers will last longer washing machine and dishwasher valves will break less frequently pipe joints will be less susceptible to failure and leaks in distribution systems will lose water more slowly at lower pressures for these reasons many utility plumbing codes and regulations require pressure reduction for customer connections 9 means of implementation and enforcement the citys public works director will have the primary responsibility for implementing the plan water conservation orders will be enforced by the city police department code enforcement officer utility department personnel and municipal court as appropriate 5a ex a sec ii adopted      annual review a the service area of the city is located within the brazos river authority regional water planning group brazos river authority g and the city has provided a copy of this plan to this entity b in the event the city requests loans from the twdb the city will be obligated to the twdb under rule 31 tac 36371 to submit an annual report to the executive administrator of the twdb on the implementation and status of the citys water conservation programs for three 3 years after the closing date for loans made by the twdb the report will be in a form and will include all information required by twdb staff to determine the citys compliance with the water conservation and drought contingency plans c the annual review of the water conservation program will be completed by the citys public works director the citys public works director will be alert throughout the year to any changes in the water supply and distribution system or to any changes in population which could affect the goals and objectives of the citys water conservation plan periodic

district is to provide a flexible alternative procedure to encourage imaginative and innovative designs for the unified development of property in the city consistent with this article and accepted urban planning with overall mixeduse regulations as set forth below and in accordance with the citys comprehensive plan the pud rules are designed i to allow development which is harmonious with nearby areas  ii to enhance and preserve areas which are unique or have outstanding scenic environmental cultural or historic significance  iii to provide an alternative for more efficient use of land resulting in smaller utility networks safer streets more open space and lower construction and maintenance costs  iv to encourage harmonious and coordinated development considering natural features community facilities circulation patterns and surrounding properties and neighborhoods  v to facilitate the analysis of the effect of development upon the tax base the local economy population public facilities and the environment  vi to provide and result in an enhanced residential andor work environment for those persons living andor working within the district  and vii to require the application of professional planning and design techniques to achieve overall coordinated mixeduse developments and avoid the negative effects of piecemeal segregated or unplanned development toward these ends rezoning of land and development under this district will be permitted only in accordance with the intent and purpose of the citys    451508 comprehensive plan and this article and to that end the pud plan must be prepared and approved in accordance with the provisions of this article b mixed use development the pud district shall include and allow for compatible mixed uses such as compatible residential commercial andor industrial within a single project within the boundaries of a an approved plan area in order to provide the flexibility required for a welldesigned and

orderly safe attractive and healthful development of land located within the community and to promote the general welfare of the community by preserving and enhancing ecological environmental and aesthetic qualities requirements for the installation and maintenance of landscaping elements and other means of site improvements in developed properties the following are additional factors considered in establishing the requirements of this section 1 paved surfaces automobiles buildings and other improvements produce increases in air temperatures a problem especially noticeable in this southern region whereas plants have the opposite effect the creation of shade likewise impervious surfaces created by development generate greater water runoff causing problems from contamination erosion and flooding preserving and improving the natural environment and maintaining a working ecological balance are of increasing concern the fact that the use of landscape elements can contribute to the processes of air purification oxygen regeneration water absorption water purification and noise glare and heat abatement as well as the preservation of the communitys aesthetic qualities
