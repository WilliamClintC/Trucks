those places where smoking is prohibited by law b there exists a substantial body of scientific research demonstrating that smoking and the effects of second hand smoke pose significant health hazards to persons who are in the presence of smokers c kansas statutory law regarding smoking in public places addresses at ksa 21 4013 the potential for city or county regulation of smoking within its boundaries so long as such regulation is at least as stringent as state law d secondhand smoke which contains 4000 chemicals 63 of which cause cancer is the third leading cause of preventable death in the united states and the national cancer institute determined in 2000 monograph # 10 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of as many as 65000 americans annually  and e the public health services national toxicology program has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen us dhhs 200 citing cal epa 1997 and 2 numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke also known as environmental tobacco smokeis a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers including heart stroke respiratory disease and lung cancer  and f the ills of smoking and secondhand smoke are well documented in all of the independent medical studies and secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to elderly people children individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease  and g 1 the us surgeon general has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce but does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke 2 the environmental protection agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation 3 air cleaners which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke 4 american society of heating refrigerating and air conditioning engineers ashrae bases its ventilation standards on totally smoke free environments because it cannot determine a safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke which contains cancer causing chemicals and ashrae acknowledges that the technology does not exist that can remove chemicals from the air that cause cancer  and h 1 a recently promulgated ashrae position document of environment tobacco smoke concludes that at present the only means of eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure is to ban all smoking activity and 2 ashrae further concludes that no current ventilation air cleaning or other technologies have been demonstrated to control health risks from environmental tobacco smoke exposure in spaces where smoking occurs  and i a significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace and employees who work in smoking permitted businesses suffer a higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer as well as increased acute respiratory disease and a measurable decrease in lung function  and j smoke filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease lower productivity higher cleaning and maintenance costs increased health insurance rates and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke  and k the ottawa city commission recognizes that environmental tobacco smoke poses a serious public health hazard  that nonsmokers need protection from environmental tobacco smoke exposure and that regulation of the burning of tobacco in public places and places of employment is imperative in order to protect the public health and welfare of the citizens of the city of ottawa  l numerous studies have determined that environmental tobacco smoke ets is a significant source of exposure to toxic air indoor contaminants causally associated with respiratory illness including lung cancer asthma and emphysema  and m there is scientific research linking ets with heart disease responsible for an estimated 35000 coronary heart disease deaths annually among adult nonsmokers in the united states as a result of ets exposure  and n ets carcinogens and poisons pose special risk to children the elderly food service employees and individuals with cardiovascular disease andor impaired respiratory function including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease  and o ets exposure has been causally associated with developmental respiratory carcinogenic and cardiovascular effects including fetal outcomes such as sudden infant death syndrome p tobacco use is the single largest cause of preventable death in kansas and according to the cdcs tobacco control state highlights 200 tobacco use alone was responsible for an estimated 3800 deaths in kansas in 199 or 16% of the total deaths in kansas in 1999  and q the separation of smokers from nonsmokers within the same airspace does not eliminate the exposure of nonsmokers to ets given that no safe level of exposure to ets has been found  r accordingly the ottawa city commission recognizes that ets poses a serious public health hazard that nonsmokers need protection from ets exposure and that therefore regulation by the governing body of the burning of tobacco in public places and places of employment is imperative in order to protect the public health and welfare of the citizens of the city of ottawa  10702 purpose the purpose of this article is to 1 improve and protect the publics health by eliminating smoking in eating establishments and public places  and 2 guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke free air  and 3

a matter of legislative determination that 1 adult businesses require special supervision from the ottawa police department in order to protect and preserve the health safety and welfare of the patrons of such businesses as well as the citizens of ottawa 2 adult businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature 3 allowing or providing such activities creates conditions that generate prostitution disorderly conduct fights drug dealing and usage infiltration of other criminal activities into the premises and adversely affects public health by the transfer of contagious or communicable diseases all of which require a significant and disproportionate allocation of law enforcement resources 4 the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the city of ottawa which demands reasonable regulation of adult businesses in order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens 5 employees of adult businesses have been convicted of prostitution and other crimes against public morals and crimes involving moral turpitude in adult businesses 6 motels which permit rental of rooms for ten hours or less foster and facilitate prostitution and increase the likelihood of the proliferation of contagious and communicable diseases 7 permitting andor licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 8 there is convincing documented evidence that adult businesses because of their very nature have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime and downgrading of property values 9 adult businesses due to their nature have operational characteristics which contribute to urban blight and downgrade the quality of life in the adjacent area 10 except for adult cabarets in those types of adult businesses in which patrons seminude or scantily clad employees other entertainers or models come in actual or close contact with patrons and with one another the sale and consumption of cereal malt beverages and alcoholic liquor should be prohibited since the number and degree of crime and activities set out in subparagraphs 13 and 5 hereinabove increase and further endanger public health safety and welfare and require increased law enforcement and an even greater disproportion of law enforcement and administrative inspections and resources 11 the governing body desires to minimize and control these adverse effects and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizenry  protect the citizens from increased crime  preserve the quality of life  preserve the property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight 12 because of increased administrative costs incurred by the city clerks office and the ottawa police department and because of the building and health inspections required by the licensing and enforcement processes the license fees for such establishments and for the entertainers and employees must be set in a reasonable amount to offset the cost to the city so that as far as reasonably possible the costs incurred are borne by the adult businesses entertainers and employees and not subsidized by the taxpayers 13 businesses allowing the sale and consumption of alcoholic liquor or cereal malt beverages on the premises frequently are the scene of disturbances disorderly conduct and other criminal activity furthermore case law and studies have established that the sale and consumption of alcoholic liquor or cereal malt beverages on the premises of an adult business will increase criminal behavior on the premises and create undesirable community conditions including depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood increased expenditures for the allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order an increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior and the acceleration of community blight thereby exacerbating the adverse secondary effects associated with such businesses 14 it is necessary to license entertainers in the adult entertainment business to prevent the exploitation of minors to ensure that each such entertainer is an adult to ensure that each such entertainer has not assumed a false name which would make regulation of the entertainer difficult or impossible and to ensure that such entertainers are not involved in criminal activity 15 it is necessary to have a licensed manager on the premises of establishments offering adult entertainment at such times as such establishments are offering adult entertainment so that there will at all necessary times be an individual responsible for the overall operation of the establishment including the actions of patrons entertainers and other employees 16 hidden ownership interests for the purposes of skimming profits and avoiding the payment of taxes have historically occurred in the adult entertainment business in the absence of regulation these hidden ownership interests have historically been held by organized and white collar crime elements in order for the city to effectively protect the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry it is important that the city be fully apprised of the actual ownership of adult entertainment establishments 17 the harmful secondary effects of adult businesses are more pronounced when conducted continuously or during late night hours and limiting the hours of operation of such businesses will enable law enforcement to concentrate its limited resources for those business hours 18 certain employees of unregulated adult businesses engage in a higher incidence of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments  further an applicant for an adult business or employee license that has been convicted of a sexuallyrelated crime is likely to engage in that behavior again in the future and preventing such a person from opening or working at an adult business for a specified period of time will help to reduce the chance that such crimes will occur at the business b the secondary effects of the activities defined and regulated in this detrimental to the public health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and therefore such activities must be regulated as provided in this it is the purpose of this promote protect and secure the general welfare health and safety of the citizens of ottawa and to preserve and protect the quality of life by all citizens and especially minors by regulating the secondary effects of such businesses it is not the intent of this suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact content neutral regulations which address the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses finally it is not the intent of this legislate with respect to matters of obscenity as obscenity is regulated by state law  111002 definitions for the purpose of this the words and phrases used herein shall have the following meanings unless

purpose 153 general provisions 154 administration 155 provisions for stream buffer 156 stream buffer variance procedures 157 penalties for violation 158 definitions findings ottawas network of streams and rivers form the backbone of its drainage system and provide many other critical benefits for the citys environmental health and quality of life the importance of this natural green infrastructure system has become even more evident rounds of stormwater master planning and implementation of stormwater management projects  preparation of the citys comprehensive plan  and as the city works collaboratively with community stakeholders to protect and improve water quality municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 program in accordance with the clean water act critical benefits provided by streams and particularly the vegetated riparian stream corridors they run include but are not limited to the following 15101 water quality natural streams creeks and rivers provide important water quality benefits as they collect and convey stormwater runoff from the citys landscape riparian corridor vegetation slows runoff that flows over stream banks reducing runoff velocities and volumes by infiltrating water into the ground preventing erosion and filtering pollutants from the remaining runoff that enters the stream vegetated streambanks also resist erosion from stream flow by slowing flow velocities and reinforcing bank stability reducing the amount of sediment entering the stream from bank erosion and failures natural vegetation and stream bed materials create turbulence that aerates stream flows increasing dissolved oxygen supporting healthy aquatic life and preventing nuisance conditions from stagnant water and anaerobic bacteria riparian vegetation provides shade that reduces water temperature for aquatic life and improves dissolved oxygen capacity 15102 flood protection floodplains and riparian corridors protect life property and infrastructure by more safely conveying flood waters streambank and riparian vegetation slows flow velocities reducing flash flood potential in downstream areas adequate unobstructed and vegetated floodplains provide capacity for higher flows when streams overflow their banks  and infiltrate a portion of the flows into the ground adequate undeveloped stream buffers also separate occupied and unoccupied structures and infrastructure from flood hazards 15103 stream degradation extensive stream assessments and research conducted in eastern kansas and nationally clearly demonstrate that adequate healthy vegetated riparian corridors and floodplains reduce and prevent stream degradation and improve overall stream health and quality by reducing runoff velocities and volumes and reinforcing streambanks healthy stream corridors prevent incision down cutting of stream beds and lateral bank erosion and advancement 15104 wildlife habitat streams and riparian corridors provide critical habitat and resources for wildlife as well as a connected network that allows safe and unimpeded movement this network is city of ottawa kansas  subdivision regulations added 091918 152 most valuable when it is complete and unfragmented allowing migration larger riparian system and connected upland habitat areas 15104 open space and recreation streams and riparian corridors provide undeveloped open space and natural areas throughout the community improving neighborhood aesthetics allowing the enjoyment of nature and providing greenways for recreational amenities like bicycle and pedestrian trails these benefits increase property values in nearby neighborhoods and districts and create healthier environments 15105 comprehensive plan for these reasons the ottawa comprehensive plan rev 111611 calls for a holistic watershed approach to stormwater management that preserves and enhances water quality while protecting and restoring natural systems a key recommendation is to develop and adopt a stream buffer ordinance noting that headwater streams are often severely degraded by urbanization and intense agricultural practices as a consequence many communities have adopted stream buffer requirements as part of an overall urban watershed protection strategya practice the city of ottawa should follow for the watershed of the marais des cygnes river and its tributaries and creeks urban stream buffers are an integral element of any local stream protection program by adopting some of these rather simple performance criteria communities can make their stream buffers more than just a line on a map better design and planning also ensure that communities realize the full environmental and social benefits of stream buffers purpose 15201 based on the findings described in this intended for the following purposes a improving water quality b protecting life and property c protecting infrastructure d providing open space amenities e providing greenway trail opportunities f protecting environmental quality g providing certainty and flexibility h increasing public knowledge and understanding of protecting water resources general provisions 15301 scope and applicability a upon
