producer of such wastes in lieu of making its own samplings and analyses c in the event any industrial waste is found by the municipality to have a bod in excess of 300 milligrams per liter the producer of said waste shall be surcharged an amount equal to the product of the actual volume of wastes in thousand gallons per billing period exclusive of storm water runoff discharged to the public sanitary sewage system and the bod surcharge rate the bod surcharge rate shall be determined by the following formula rc    p c300 where rc   the bod surcharge rate in cents per 1000 gallons of waste discharged p   the average annual fixed operating and maintenance cost of secondary treatment processes per pound of bod received at the treatment works prior to completion of the first year of operation the value of p shall be assumed to be four 4 cents c   the average bod of the industrial waste expressed in milligrams per liter as determined in accordance with of this figure 300 appearing

s   the suspended solids surcharge rate in cents per 1000 gallons of waste discharged b   the average annual fixed operating and maintenance cost of the sludge digestion sludge drying and sludge disposal operations per pound of suspended solids received at the treatment works prior to completion of the first year of operation the value of b shall be assumed to be four 4 cents s   the average suspended solids concentration of the abnormal industrial waste expressed in milligrams per liter as determined in accordance with of this figure 350 appearing in the above formula correspond to the maximum suspended solids concentration permissible without surcharge the figure  is the factor to convert milligrams per liter to pounds per 1000 gallons no discount will be permitted for sewage or industrial wastes having a suspended solids concentration less than 350 milligrams per liter e the surcharges provided for in this be added to the sewage collection transportation and treatment

stormwater management the city of franklin 138102 statement of findings the council of the city of franklin finds that a inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources b a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the city of franklin and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment c inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydro logic patterns  accelerating stream flows which increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation  destroying aquatic habitat  and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments nutrients heavy metals and pathogens groundwater resources are also impacted of recharge d stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality e public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues f federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls these municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes 138103 purpose the purpose of this to promote health safety and welfare within the city of franklin by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in of this provisions intended to a meet legal water quality requirements under state law including regulations at 25 pa to protect maintain reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the commonwealth b manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems close to their source by regulating activities that cause these problems c preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible d maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources e maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses f preserve and restore the floodcarrying capacity of streams and prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds g manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source with a minimum of structures and a maximum use of natural
