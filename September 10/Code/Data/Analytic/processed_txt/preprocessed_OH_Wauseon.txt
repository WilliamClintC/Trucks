regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10   this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position   enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation

the formula set forth in of the compute the percentage of their entire net profits derived from activities both within and outside the municipality of wauseon which is taxable under the to determine the tax payable to the municipality thereunder if the taxpayer did not have a place of business outside wauseon during the period covered by any declaration andor return required under the its business allocation percentage is 100 percent  in other words the taxpayer is required to pay a tax of one percent on the entire net profit of the business if the taxpayer had a place or places of business outside wauseon ohio and was doing business in wauseon ohio during such period the business allocation percentage shall be computed on the basis as set forth in a8 of the business allocation percentage is computed by determining the percentages 1which wauseon real and tangible personal property bears to all real and tangible personal property including that situated in wauseon of the taxpayer wheresoever situated  2which wauseon business sales bear to the taxpayers entire business sales wheresoever derived including those derived from wauseon  and 3which payrolls paid by the taxpayer within wauseon bear to the taxpayers entire payroll wheresoever paid including wauseon payrolls  adding together the three percentages so arrived at and dividing the total by three however if one of the factors property sales or payrolls is missing the other two percentages are added and the sum is divided by two and if two of the factors are missing the remaining percentage is the business allocation percentage  example 1 corporations having places of business in wauseon ohio detroit and cleveland wauseon ohio real and tangible personal property at $10000 all real and personal property wauseon ohio detroit and cleveland $100000 percentage 10% wauseon ohio sales $15000 all sales $75000 percentage 20% wauseon ohio payroll $6000 all payroll $20000 percentage 30% business allocation percentage  10% plus 20% plus 30% 3equals 20%  example 2 same corporation owning no real or tangible personal property anywhere wauseon ohio sales $15000 all sales $75000 percentage 20% wauseon ohio payroll $6000 all payroll $20000 percentage 30% business allocation percentage  20% plus 30% 2equals 25%  example 3 same corporation owning real and tangible personal property in wauseon ohio valued at $10000 and owning no real or tangible personal property outside wauseon ohio other factors same as in examples 1 and 2 business allocation percentage  100% plus 20% plus 30% 3equals 50%  after determining such business allocation percentage the tax shall be determined by applying that percentage to the entire net profits of the taxpayer wherever derived thus arriving at the taxable net profit and computing one percent of the resultant taxable net profit in case it appears to the finance director that any income or capital of the taxpayer is improperly or inaccurately reflected the finance director may adjust items of income expense deduction and capital and disregard assets in computing any allocation percentage provided any income directly traceable thereto is also excluded from entire net income so as equitably to determine the tax  bexplanation of property factor the percentage of the taxpayers real and tangible personal property within wauseon ohio is determined by dividing the net book value during the period covered by the report of such property within wauseon ohio without deduction of any encumbrances by the average net book value similarly computed of all such property within and without wauseon only property owned by the taxpayer is considered in determining such percentage  cexplanation of sales factor receipts from the following are allocable to wauseon ohio 1work done and performed or services rendered in wauseon 2rentals from property situated in wauseon where the rental of such property is a usual or normal part of the taxpayers business activity 3for the purpose of determining business allocation percentage no account shall be given to receipts within or without the municipality of income derived from intangibles including stocks bonds royalties and the like the income of which is taxable under the statutes of the state of ohio 4compensation and other receipts for work done or services performed within the municipality are allocable to wauseon and taxable under the all amounts so received credited or charged by taxpayer in payment for such work or services are so allocable irrespective of whether done or performed by employees or agents of taxpayer or by any other person it is immaterial where such amounts were payable or where they were received commissions or fees received by the taxpayer are allocated to the municipality if the services for which the commissions were paid were performed in wauseon if the taxpayers services for which commissions or fees were paid were performed for the taxpayer by salesmen or other agents or employees attached to or working out of a wauseon place of business of the taxpayer the taxpayers services will be deemed to have been performed in the municipality where a lump sum is received by the taxpayer in payment for services within and without the municipality the amount attributable to services within the municipality is to be determined on the basis of the relative values of or amounts of time spent in the performance of such services within and without the municipality 5receipts from sales of capital assets property not held by the taxpayer for sale to customers in the regular course of business are not business receipts receipts from the sale of real property held by the taxpayer as a dealer for sale to customers in the regular course of business are business receipts and are allocable to the municipality if the real property was situated in the municipality receipts from sale of intangibles included in business capital held by the taxpayer as a dealer for sale to customers in the regular course of business are business receipts and are allocable to wauseon if the sales were made in the municipality or regular place of business of the taxpayer in the municipality  dpayroll factor the percentage of the taxpayers payroll allocable to the municipality is determined by dividing the wages salaries and other personal service compensation of the taxpayers employees within wauseon during the period covered by the report by the total amount of compensation of all taxpayers employees during such period wages salaries and other compensation are computed on the cash or accrual basis in accordance with the methods of accounting used in the computation of the entire net income of the taxpayer employees within wauseon usually includes all employees regularly connected with or working out of a place of business maintained by the taxpayer in wauseon however where an employee performed services both within and without the municipality the amount treated as compensation for services performed within the municipality shall be deemed to be 1in the case of an employee whose compensation depends directly on the volume of business secured by him such as a salesman on a commission basis the amount received by him for the business attributable to his efforts within wauseon ohio  2in the case of an employee whose compensation depends on other results achieved the proportion of the total compensation which the value of his services within the municipality bears to the value of all his services  and 3in the case of an employee compensated on a time basis the proportion of the total amount received by him which the working time employed in the municipality bears to the total working time  eadjustment of business allocation percentage formula generally the business allocation percentage formula will result in a fair apportionment of the taxpayers net profits within and without the municipality however due to the peculiar circumstances of certain businesses the formula may work a hardship in some cases or result in a tax evasion in others thus not do justice to the taxpayer or the municipality accordingly in such cases the finance director may substitute factors calculated to bring about a fair and proper allocation in any case where the taxpayer has adopted the optional use of the business allocation percentage formula res 197014 passed 82470 19309 effective date athe tax referred to in 04 shall first be levied collected and paid with respect to the salaries wages bonuses incentive
