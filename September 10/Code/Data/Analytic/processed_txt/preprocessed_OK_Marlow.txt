determined by the city of constructing or installing the improvements and utilities required  1118limitations on minor subdivisions  11181 purpose minor subdivisions provide certain advantages such as a shorter application process and less public scrutiny that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications given these advantages the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via consecutive andor contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision it is the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit the practice of chain subdivisions where the same land owner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common contiguous parcels which collectively total more than four lots it is also the intent of the mayor and city council to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a threeyear time period in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major subdivision process the city administrator is granted authority to deem a minor subdivision as a chain subdivision for the purposes of this section 11182 common contiguous parcels shown on minor subdivision plats contiguous common parcels as defined by this ordinance shall be referenced on all applications for minor subdivisions and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of any application for minor subdivision for purposes of determining whether or not the division of land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision common contiguous parcels shall not be counted as lots in the case of a minor subdivision 11183 limitations land within a minor subdivision including all contiguous parcels owned by the subdivider shall not be further divided for a period of three years unless a preliminary plat application is filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of this ordinance if property proposed to be subdivided was part of an original tract and if the property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in the last three years then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited this provision shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under separate ownership  however this provision is intended to be construed so that one property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a three year period it is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of three years regardless of ownership  1119standards for configuring new streets  11191 purpose and intent the entire community enjoys the benefits of an interconnected network of streets and roads it is the intention of the locality that new street alignments in new developments reflect the traditional style exhibited throughout older established neighborhoods interconnected streets afford easier safer access for emergency vehicles school buses and sanitation trucks while distributing traffic more evenly

11192 street alignment intersections and jogs streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets under normal conditions streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles 90 degrees but in no case shall such a street intersection be less than 75 degrees where street offsets or jogs cannot be avoided offset t intersections shall be separated by

some future date shall provide a temporary culdesac as required by the city administrator  11196 marginal access streets whenever a major subdivision is proposed abutting the rightofway of a us or state highway a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to such rightofway may be required by the planning commission at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land between such marginal access street and highway rightofway the planning commission may also require a 20foot noaccess easement and planting strip along the major arterial street to ensure that lots fronting on said street do not have access thereto see figure   images0001792jpg  11197 alleys and service access alleys shall be provided and must be paved deadend alleys shall be avoided were possible  but
