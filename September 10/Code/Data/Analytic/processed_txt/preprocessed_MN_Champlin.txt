these singlefamily structures are on small singlefamily lots that alone could not support a new commercial building andor parking area that meets current city standards further it is reasonable to expect that these singlefamily structures will be converted to commercial establishments 2 because the city strives for a wellplanned community that protects the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of the city there is a need for an ordinance that regulates the conversion of existing singlefamily structures to commercial establishments 3 because the conversion of existing singlefamily structures is unique to the old town area there is a need to establish an overlay district which stipulates site performance guidelines to regulate setbacks lot coverage parking

enjoyment of neighboring property the planning commission and city council in determining the reasonableness of the increase in the authorized dwelling units per acre shall recognize that increased
