and objectives definitions general provisions administration provisions for flood hazard reduction  statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and objectives astatutory authorization the legislature of the state of washington has delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council of the city of chelan washington does ordain as follows bfindings of fact 1the flood hazard areas of the city of chelan are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and when inadequately anchored damage uses in other areas uses that are inadequately floodproofed elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss cstatement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare  and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed 1to protect human life and health  2to minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects  3to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard  6to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas  7to ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard  8to ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions dmethods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter includes methods and provisions for 1restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3controlling

increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases 2variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result 3variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief 4variances shall only be issued upon aa showing of good and sufficient cause  ba determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant  ca determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety extraordinary public expense create nuisances cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances 5variances as interpreted in the national flood insurance program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property  they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure its inhabitants economic or financial circumstances they primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods as such variances from flood elevations should be quite rare 6variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dryfloodproofing where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential complies with all other variance criteria except subsection d1 of this section and otherwise complies with a1 2 and 4 7any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the permitted structure will be built with its lowest floor below the base flood elevation and

all exterior remodels and additions commenced within a threeyear period that affect the exterior appearance of the building andor increase the buildings footprint by up to fifty percent the requirement for such remodelsadditions is only that the proposed addition and improvements meet the standards and do not lead to further nonconformance with the standards for example if a property owner decides to replace a building facades siding then the siding shall meet the applicable exterior building material standards but elements such as building articulation would not be required 2level ii additions include all building additions commenced within a threeyear period that increase the buildings footprint by more than fifty percent but not greater than one hundred percent all

certain classes of buildings to certain localities and to restrict other uses the continued existence of those which are nonconforming are inconsistent with these goals and therefore nonconforming buildings and uses should be reduced to conformity as completely and quickly as possible without causing substantial injustice the city council recognizes that absent specific regulations nonconforming uses may tend to flourish it is not the citys intent that nonconforming signs continue in perpetuity for this reason the city has continued the amortization process which started with the adoption of a tenyear amortization period contained in chelan the city council finds there are reasonably priced alternatives to the maintenance of nonconforming signs and the periods for amortization listed below will provide owners of existing nonconforming signs with a reasonable opportunity to obtain other alternative signs and a period to amortize the reasonable economic life and use of any existing nonconforming signs bnotice the city will provide written notice of the expiration of the amortization period as noted above to the person responsible for said signs at their last known address and provide notice to the owner of the property on which the sign is located the city will utilize the tax assessors office to find the latest updated address for the property owner said notice will be provided by mail postmarked no later than thirty days prior to the cutoff date provided for in this section for request for considerationextension seven months prior to expiration of amortization period unless extenuating circumstances as determined by the city require otherwise crequest for considerationextension the city has established the time periods stated in subsection b of this section with the understanding that these time periods along with the tenyear period established pursuant to chelan provide a reasonable time period to recover the life expectancy of most signs however the city recognizes there may be special unusual circumstances that may fall outside of those parameters 1any person aggrieved by the imposition of the amortization clause may request a review of such application of the clause the request for review shall be filed with the city not later than six months prior to the expiration of the amortization period the review shall be heard by the board of adjustment pursuant to the aggrieved applicant has the burden of establishing the unreasonableness of the amortization period and must provide evidence showing the particular period is unreasonable 3the board of adjustment shall consider such things as lease obligations life expectancy of the nonconformance depreciation and the actual amount invested in the nonconforming sign the board of adjustment shall also consider alternative uses available to the applicant to bring the design into compliance the board of adjustment shall not consider replacement costs or fair market value in determining the value to the applicant 4the board of adjustment shall also consider the benefit to the public that is derived from the termination of the nonconformance including the concern for safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic  whether distracting signs may serve to break the concentration of those using the roads with the result of loss of life or property  or the location of the sign so as not to impair the safety of a moving vehicle by obscuring the drivers vision in addition the board of adjustment is to consider the promotion of public safety the promotion of aesthetic values and the interest of the general welfare 5the board of adjustment shall consider the preservation and improvement of the citys physical environment natural amenities and desirable characteristics of the city as set forth in the citys land use regulations the board of adjustment may consider any combination of these legitimate public concerns  however the board of adjustment may not rely solely upon the promotion of the aesthetic values to the city in supporting the amortization period 6the board of adjustment shall conduct a balancing of interest considering the interest and hardship to the applicant and whether the hardship to the applicant reasonably outweighs the benefit the public would derive from the termination of the nonconformance if after careful consideration the board of adjustment finds the amortization period as applied to the applicants nonconformance would result in a greater hardship to the applicant than benefit to the public the board of adjustment may extend the amortization period to a point in time where the balancing of interests would support the termination of the nonconformance in no event shall this amortization period be greater than three additional years dloss of nonconforming status a nonconforming sign shall immediately lose its nonconforming designation if 1the sign is altered in any way or moved  2the business changes
