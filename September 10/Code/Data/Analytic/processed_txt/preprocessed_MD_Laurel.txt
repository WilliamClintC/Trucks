commercial activities  2 to protect adjacent residential neighborhoods by regulating the types and spacing of business uses particularly at the common boundaries which would create hazards noise odors or other objectionable influences  3 to encourage the tendency of commercial development to locate in concentrated groups of facilities which are mutually compatible and which have in common similar trading areas and similar frequency of use  4 to improve traffic efficiency maintenance of design capacities and to lessen congestion on streets particularly in residential areas  5 to establish criteria and procedures for planned business areas so they may be coordinated with surrounding developments  and 6 to promote the most desirable land use and traffic patterns in accordance with the objectives of the master plan and this article b purposes of specific commercial zones the function and characteristics of each of the commercial zones established by this article are intended to be as follows 1 commercial neighborhood zone the purpose of this classification is to provide a zone which i encourages the economic stability and preservation of historic commercial uses such as offices small businesses and other trade establishments that have developed within specified older sections of the city and developed under older codes and ordinances  ii provides both flexibility and control in their continuance options exercised by the planning commission and iii allows improvement and expansion where the uses both existing and proposed have no detrimental effect on adjoining commercial or residential properties which have developed largely in existing structures whose reconversion to residential use is unlikely properties placed in the commercial neighborhood zones may also be locations for mixed use in order to fulfill the housing goals of the duly adopted master plan such as establishing housing opportunities for the elderly and the handicapped the following shall be the specific intents of the neighborhood commercial zone a to recognize businesses which have evolved and which are largely contained in the citys historic district areas or immediate environs b to provide a mechanism to control the expansion of these uses c to allow infill development where such expansion may be appropriate and compatible with surrounding properties d to recognize and permit the continuance of small yard regulations e to insure that resulting rehabilitation renovation or new construction is in character with surrounding neighborhoods which shall involve coordination where applicable with the historic district commission 2 commercial community zone the purpose of this classification is to provide locations for predominantly retail commercial shopping facilities for a substantially wider service area than those provided for in the commercial neighborhood zone yet not containing the fuller range of commercial activities which characterize and justify the commercial general zone consequently many open uses are excluded in order to ensure the tight pedestrianoriented character which typifies a shopping precinct or because they are incompatible with the proper functioning of type of commercial node 3 commercial general zone the purpose of this classification is to provide locations for general retail commercial activities these activities are those associated with a large trade area serving a large portion of the regional area the list of permitted uses excludes those uses which are considered incompatible with general retail functions where possible land classified in this zone should be located on roads carrying large volumes of traffic  be grouped in concentrations of relatively large areas and narrow frontage  have few points of highway access  and concentrations should be relatively far apart 4 commercial shopping center zone the purpose of this classification is to provide zones where compatible commercial facilities with functional relationships will be planned organized and grouped in a building or in a unified arrangement of buildings and service facilities all designed on a designated area of sufficient dimensions to satisfy all offstreet parking demands and located along major arterial streets where the traffic generated by such development can be accommodated in a manner that the public health welfare and safety of the surrounding area will be maintained 5 commercial village zone the purpose of this classification is to provide for a zone which i encourages the economic stability and improvement of the main street business area and its immediate environs ii furthers the improvement and retention of the historic character of the main street business district options of the city planning commission guidelines on historic preservation of the historic district commission iii encourages the continuation and establishment of small business office uses skilled craft occupations and entertainment facilities along with certain residential uses which are appropriate to the scale and existing character of the main street business area iv encourages mixed use of permitted uses appropriate to the business district it shall be the specific intent of the commercial village zone to be utilized where historic development of the business district uses formed a pattern of buildings and other features that would be disrupted by a standard zoning category intended for highway uses its placement is intended where established building patterns have been developed and new development rehabilitation or other improvement proposals face practical hardships due to their inability zoning to be compatible with the existing character of the district the placement of any property within the commercial village zone infers the use of modification procedures planning commission to alleviate undue hardship relating to parking restrictions setback and other yard requirements necessary to maintain the existing character of the business district 6 commercial village activity center zone the purpose of this classification is to provide locations where localized retail service commercial and employment opportunities can be located to serve an existing population or located where approved residential development is programmed to serve an area within a two 2 to four 4 mile radius the zone can also provide locations to serve as a town center for residential development located within walking distance to offer easy access to stores services and employment uses located within the zone   use regulations cncommercial neighborhood zone buildings and land shall be used and buildings shall be designed erected occupied altered moved or maintained in whole or in part in commercial

letter of credit a trust for completion of improvements or a letter of commitment from a financial institution must be submitted consideration of a replacement structures will require at least two 2 hearings the plans should include the materials in documentation of these guidelines and the design of the new structures should conform to new construction of these guidelines   doors and entrances the entry of a structure is a focal point and should receive special attention replacement doors should be compatible with the architectural style of the structure typical doors in historic districts are constructed of either wood or metal and may be paneled a combination of panels and glass fulllight glass especially in commercial establishments a number of lights panes in awood or metal frames such as the 15light french door flush louvered paired doors sliding patio doors storm doors or screen doors are some suggestions storm or screen doors should be the same size as the main door and be compatible in appearance often the door is part of an embellished entryway consisting of the doors sidelights transoms columns pedimental trim or recessed entry however the size of such entrances should be in keeping with the scale of the building their removal or replacement by simpler entryways has been discouraged   driveways and parking pads the historic district commission reviews applications for driveways and parking pads to ensure that their installation and the materials used is consistent with other lots in the block and with the historic nature of the neighborhood the commission discourages the use of gravel parking in most of laurels residential historic districts has been to the side or rear of the structure the relocation of parking out of front yards to a less conspicuous portion of a residential lot is desirable for the maintenance of the residential character of neighborhoods   fences the construction of fences separating yards is common throughout the historic districts fence heights are limited by the zoning regulations and while the historic district commission may authorize a fence lower than the maximum eg for consistency with the fence on a neighboring property it cannot approve fencing higher than the zoning regulations allows in all cases any decision made by the planning commission overrides the decisions of the city of laurel historic district commission the finished side of the fence should always face outward away from the lot area or structure which it surrounds fences in the front yard shall be at the property or at the building line of the front facade the use of traditional painted picket fencing in front yards is acceptable solid flatboard fencing of any height is not permitted in the front yard the use of chainlink fencing is discouraged as being least compatible with the historic environment and allowed only in exceptional circumstances the installation of a fence beside an existing fence is viewed by the commission as not in keeping with the character of the neighborhood as well as a potential maintenance problem the commission will not approve such installation the historic district commission permits specific fence types on a casebycase basis the specific fencing permitted depending on surrounding properties and the architectural character of the neighborhood   garages see accessory structures   handicap ramps the city of laurel and federal law require handicap ramps on public buildings and on businesses when they change use and the commission cannot set those requirements aside however while recognizing the need for reasonable access the commission is concerned with appearance of such ramps and urges that they a be placed as inconspicuously as possible which can often be accomplished by screening with bushes or other plantings facade  b if possible be placed on the side or rear of the building rather than on the front  and c be compatible in architectural style and color to the structure ie porch style materials color scheme to the extent however that this section or any portion hereof conflicts with federal law federal law shall be controlling and the conflicting portion of this section shall be deemed stricken   landscaping a the historic district commission requires the submission of a detailed scaled landscape plan prior to final approval of the plans for new construction including additions b commission approval is required for major landscaping design or reconfiguration on sites that have been declared historic by inclusion as a historic site on the national or state register or declared individually a historic site by action the mayor and city council c minor landscaping for small shrubs or flowers and routine landscaping maintenance such as mulching or pruning of trees up to thirtythree 33 percent of the tree mass does not require commission approval removal of any dangerous or diseased landscaping or trees does not require commission approval so long as the staff and the city agree that the landscaping or tree is a hazard or diseased such tree or landscaping must be replaced only if required by an approved site or landscape plan the director of community planning and business services shall approve any requests for removal of trees or shrubs   mailboxes all mailboxes shall conform to the requirements and standards of the united states postal service the commission will review only regarding color and style to ensure compatibility with other mailboxes in the neighborhood   new construction a generally the unique character of the city of laurel historic district has evolved over one hundred 100 years by introducing new elements to the streetscapes new construction has the potential to make immediate and lasting changes to the character of the historic district new construction should express its contemporary nature while relating visually to the historic resources which surround it structures in the historic district represent many architectural styles designs should be compatible with the existing structures the design of a new building in the historic district must be sensitive to its environment and should capitalize on those features which create the historic character of the district the densely developed nature of the historic district requires that the visual effect of new construction must be considered not only in relationship to the immediately adjacent structures but also with regard to the broader context of the streetscape and block issues to be addressed in design development include rhythm site features and landscaping setback spacing height scale massing facade and openings proportion size detailing materials texture and roof forms b streetscapes streetscapes have characteristic patterns which are created by the site spacing and proportions of buildings the organization of facades and architectural details in planning for new construction these patterns or rhythms should be analyzed and incorporated into the design 1 additions to structures contemporary additions to historic buildings require special care and sensitivity in design the addition should respect the existing building and materials and generally should remain distinct from the original structure and have its own design integrity 2 new additions should be planned and executed in a manner that preserves integrity of the existing building and its environment significant historic architectural fabric or detailing should not be removed destroyed or obscured by new additions 3 the size scale and massing of the addition should be compatible with the original building and surrounding structures additions should be subordinate to the original building in height scale massing and detail 4 additions should be fully integrated with the existing construction but should remain clearly distinguishable from the original building a slight offset between the old section and the new a subtle change in materials or a vertical joint or trim element can accomplish this c site features and landscaping other site features should be compatible to the surrounding streetscape in materials and design new parking areas and garages should be located on the site in a manner that is sensitive to the surrounding properties and the general streetscape including the possible use of landscaping or other screening features paving materials and design should be appropriate to the historic context d setback new construction should provide a setback that is sensitive setback of adjacent structures and structures in the neighborhood e spacing the spatial relationships among existing buildings on a block and neighborhood suggest an appropriate width and spacing for new construction in the historic district f height the eave or cornice lines of existing buildings on a particular street define a range of heights new construction should remain within this range of heights in order to achieve the goal of compatibility with surrounding structures g scale the size and proportion of doors windows details etc are related to each other and to the spaces between them new construction should be consistent in scale with surrounding buildings and their elements h massing new construction should continue the pattern of massing if any of adjacent and neighboring structures i facade and openings proportion size detailing new facades should be compatible with historic buildings in proportion and relationships to wall area and openings windows and door openings should correspond to the rhythm and proportion that exist on neighboring structures generally doors and windows are proportioned vertically the total area of windows on a residential facade should be in a range of twentyfive 25 percent to forty 40 percent of the total surface area in buildings with commercial uses on the first floor the area of ground floor openings should be in the range of sixtyfive 65 percent to seventyfive 75 percent to correspond with traditional storefront organization further detailed information regarding doors and entrances and windows can be found in doors and entrances and windows respectively of these guidelines j materials materials for new construction should be selected from among those that are typical of surrounding buildings and should be compatible with existing materials in color and texture brick masonry and wood frame are the predominant construction methods in the historic district brick color texture and bonding pattern should be compatible with those seen in surrounding buildings brick veneer may provide a less expensive alternative to masonry construction k siding and trim new construction may employ a variety of wood trim and siding profiles siding should have a smooth finish profile that is compatible with existing buildings in the neighborhood the use of synthetic siding materials such as aluminum or vinyl is discouraged on the primary facade of a new building synthetic siding is acceptable on secondary elevations side or rear where the synthetic material will not be readily visible from a public way in this application siding must have a profile that is compatible with existing buildings in the neighborhood new construction should avoid the use of the following as wall materials or finishes asbestos reflective glass unparged or unpainted concrete block splitfaced concrete masonry units porcelain coated metal panels permastone formstone and fiberglass l roof form and materials the profile of roofs against the sky is an important aspect of the character of streetscapes in the historic district a variety of roof styles contribute to this effect including gable shed hip and flat forms the roof on a new building should conform with the predominant form orientation and height of roofs on the street the preservation and in kind replacement of metal roofs is strongly encouraged many buildings in the historic district have complex roofs made up of the primary form of the main roof and the secondary forms of roofs on additions porches entries etc this variety is an important traditional characteristic which may be incorporated into the design of new buildings some of the gableroofed buildings in the historic district have dormer windows this traditional architectural element may be incorporated into a contemporary design dormers should remain a minor design feature and should not dominate the roof slope and elevation where they appear  they should be aligned with the facade windows or located between the openings below the pitch of dormers should repeat that of the main roof shed dormers should only be used on roof slopes not visible from the street skylights may be incorporated into new construction but must be designed with special care as these elements can disrupt the continuity of the roofscape along the street they should be located on secondary elevations not readily visible from the public way and should be carefully integrated into the overall roof form for more information on roof form and materials refer to roofs and roofing of these guidelines m mechanical equipment the type and location of new heating and cooling equipment and other mechanical devices should be carefully planned in new construction as these elements can detract from both the building and its surroundings rooftop mechanical units television and radio antenna and satellite dishes should not be visible from the public way unless permitted under current fcc regulations if it is not possible they should be screened andor painted to blend with the building if required by zoning regulations electrical telephone and cable service is required to be placed underground permanent mechanical equipment including but not limited to air conditioner units fuel tanks gauges and meters and thewall systems are discouraged on the front facade portable equipment such as window units are permitted mechanical systems should be placed on the side or rear of the structure screening features such as fencing and landscaping should be incorporated into the installation   painting the painting of brick and certain other masonry materials is discouraged the use of sandblasting for removal of paint from brick may not be permitted if it will cause undue damage to historic sites or structures chemical treatment for paint removal is regulated by state environmental agencies   patios and walkways construction renovation and replacement of walkways and patios shall be reviewed by the commission materials such as brick stone macadam bituminous paving blacktop and concrete exposed aggregate concrete and interlocking pavers are acceptable   windows a openings in the mass of the structure give further definition by their specific style doublehung single or multiple panes in each sash casement sliding and specialty units such as round halfround hexagonal picture windows or combination of types windows should be consistent with the style of architecture of the structure b the preservation of historic windows is encouraged by the commission to allow flexibility in achieving energy efficiency the use of vinyl or aluminum clad units is permitted c the use of imitation muntins separators between windowpanes which do not resemble the original historic windows is discouraged   placement of the structure on the site the placement of the structure on its site shall comply with zoning regulations and should be compatible with the neighborhood and block pattern   porches porches should be retained and their repair or restoration should duplicate as near as possible the original construction new porch flooring railings columns stairs skirting or other details should appear as near as possible the same as the original work the use of nontraditional materials when not intrusive clearly visible from the public rightofway may be permitted the enclosing of open porches on historic structures especially on front and wraparound porches is discouraged finishes such as the painting or staining of new materials should match the original appearance the use of modern pressuretreated decking to replace original tongueandgroove flooring has been discouraged since this material does not match tongueandgroove even if painted steps leading up to porches may be of wood brick stone or concrete as appropriate to the material and architecture of the main structure the historic district commission recommends the replacement of existing steps inkind railings on porch stairs should have handrails and pickets to match the railing of the porch   preservation incentives a preservation tax credits are governed by of the laurel city amended by dated  tax credit

structure b these guidelines apply whether the shutter is operable or fixed c double windows for double windows the width and height of each shutter should except where not possible be sufficient to cover twentyfive 25 percent of the window and shall be consistent with the style of the structure and the historic nature of the neighborhood   signage signs and their size are controlled by zoning regulations the historic district commission may deal with the design of such sign but not content its placement on the structure and the color of such sign as well as other adopted city policies concerning signage and streetscapes if applicable a general guidelines 1 the commercial area of the historic district primarily laurels main street and portions of route 1 and their preservation is of special interest to the city these areas include a considerable number of signs which taken in total affect the overall visual quality and appeal of the historic district 2 while size scale and location of signs are regulated by zoning regulations the historic district commission in considering the overall appearance of the sign including the general design materials and color may apply stricter standards 3 the lettering on all signs may have the business name and may have a secondary message typically signs applied directly to storefront and lower building surfaces may contain letterscharacters that are up to ten 10 inches in height the secondary message letterscharacters may be no larger than five 5 inches in height telephone numbers internet or email addresses logos symbols slogans and brand names may be no larger than three 3 inches in height 4 design allowing originality and style while not creating a discontinuity within the rest of the streetscape can be achieved by close attention to the continuity of mounting location sign band materials and other such qualities 5 materials colors and style of lettering these three 3 elements of each sign should reflect compatibility with a buildings design and use as well as the appropriateness of the signs texture and material in relationship to the building for example wood is the preferred materials  iridescent and neon bright colors are discouraged 6 message the message should be limited to the specifies of the business located within the premises logos symbols slogans and brand names are

placement of signs should respect the existing pattern established by signs on the same block on buildings with two 2 or more storefronts signs should be arranged in a uniform manner the number and size of signs shall be as allowed pursuant to zoning regulations 8 type frontlighted signs such as gooseneck lights are preferred external lighting for freestanding signs should be masked by shrubbery or other screening 9 porch sign band signs these are signs which hang from porch lintels between the maximum height for such signs is one 1 foot a sign more than one 1 foot in height may be considered if the scale of the sign is appropriate in size to the building on where it is placed the maximum length for such signs is eight 8 feet but if the distance between posts is not that great the sign
