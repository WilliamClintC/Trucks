meet both of the following criteria 1 the project or development entails construction on or over land paving on or over land or other disturbance or modification of land that will have a measurable or

approval of either the public works or inspections departments of the city under other provisions of this b this article shall apply to and be enforceable against the owner of the property that is subject to development of the type described above and all persons firms or corporations engaged in activities for which authorization is required under the terms of this article 141   11132001

applicability a general purposes the planned unit development pud district is designed to permit flexible development of projects which are comprehensively planned as a single development with a functional master development plan which fully considers the entire site as an integrated project and gives broad consideration to impacts and relationships to surrounding areas the pud district permits flexibility in locating buildings mixtures of building types and land uses and open spaces in permitting such flexibility the city council should consider policies or goals in the city master plan and any village master plan approved by the planning commission and other broad public benefits demonstrated in a master development plan the planning commission or city council may attach conditions to a master development plan proposed for a pud to safeguard the public health safety morals and general welfare b specific purposes each master development plan for a proposed pud district shall advance the following specific planning purposes 1 the plan should take into consideration policy statements identified in association with use of the pud district as a future land use policy in an officially approved village master plan  and 2 the plan shall encourage more efficient development and use of land which results in one or more of the following benefits to the general public that could not be gained under standard zoning districts such as a reduced negative aesthetic and environmental impacts from buildings and site development facilities including better management of or reduction in the environmental impacts of development on the surrounding community  b a better relationship between buildings streetscapes and public or common open spaces resulting in an integrated community character that considers extensions and transitions to adjacent areas as well as relationships to the particular characteristics of the site  c less burden of traffic on streets roads and highways including better pedestrian accommodations and connections  or d exemplary design of buildings and civic spaces which reinforces and complements the existing character of surrounding areas c

the zoning district standards in each case a master development plan shall be used to create a better arrangement of the buildings lots or uses than would otherwise be allowed under the base zoning district standards however each element of the site shall be based on a zoning district most closely associated with the building types and uses and the master development plan shall demonstrate and identify where deviations from the standards of that district are necessary to achieve the goals of the master development plan and provide broader public benefits d minimum acreage the minimum contiguous acreage for a master development plan and application of the pud zoning district shall be 1 four acres for areas covered by an approved village master plan of the city and specifically
