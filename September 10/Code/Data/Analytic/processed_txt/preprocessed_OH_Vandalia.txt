the numbering system used in these codified ordinances is similar to that used in the ohio revised is consistent with general practice each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 23802 indicates that the code number is 2 the chapter number is 238 or the 38th chapter within code 2 and the section number is 02 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being the first two digits left of the decimal the section number appears to the right of the decimal as another example 40801 indicates that the code number is 4 the chapter number is 408 or the 8th chapter within code 4 and the section number is 01 with this numbering system the codified ordinances may be expanded almost endlessly codes titles and chapters are initially evennumbered thus reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as in the revised are the traffic and general offenses codes where the penalties are either grouped in one chapter in each are included as part of the sections newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 66006 and precede 66007 to be placed in their logical position enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code subsections

improvement the question of whether or not to assess for a public improvement the method of assessment and the amount and duration of the assessment will be determined by council after holding public hearings for affected property owners 3in the case of frontfootage assessments if the front property footage exceeds 200 feet the assessment shall be applied only to the developed portion of the

benefit derived by the property owner from said improvement 5in no case will a property owners total assessment be greater than onethird the value of the developed property dany property owner

general welfare of the citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of adult entertainment facilities within the city the provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented materials similarly it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the first amendment or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material rather this chapter is intended to provide for the proper location of adult uses in order to protect the integrity of adjacent neighborhoods educational uses religious uses parks and other areas where large numbers of minors regularly travel or congregate and the quality of urban life it is the intent of this chapter to limit the adverse secondary effects of adult uses the standards in this chapter are intended to ensure that residential districts religious uses educational uses parks and other areas where large numbers of minors regularly travel or congregate are located in areas free from the adverse secondary effects of adult uses the location of residential districts religious uses educational uses parks and other areas where large numbers of minors regularly travel or congregate within viable unblighted and desirable areas supports the preservation of property values and promotes the health safety and welfare of the public b  findings based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on a community in reports and studies made available to the council including but not limited to st paul minnesota  phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  amarillo texas  garden grove california  los angeles california  whittier california  austin texas  seattle washington  and oklahoma city oklahoma and on findings incorporated in cases decided by the united states supreme court other federal courts and ohio courts city council finds that the enactment of this chapter to regulate the adult uses is a substantial government interest for the city in preserving the quality of urban life and that it is in the interest of the health safety morals and general welfare of the citizens of vandalia that adult uses are regulated pursuant to the standards herein council further finds 1 adult entertainment facilities lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are often uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for such activities that occur on their premises 2 certain employees of certain adult entertainment facilities engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of adult entertainment facilities further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the adult entertainment facility is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the permittee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment facility fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 4requiring permittees of adult entertainment facility to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments passed 61608 81202definitions the definitions enumerated

following paragraphs of this section acategorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the industrial users intake water in accordance with this section any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the potw upon request of the industrial user the applicable standard will be calculated on a net basis meaning adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water if the following requirements are met 1either the applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in 40 cfr subchapter n specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis or the industrial user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or used to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would if properly installed and operated meet the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake water 2credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand bod total suspended solids tss and oil and grease should not be granted unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the users effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere 3credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standards up to a maximum value equal to the influent value additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standards adjusted under this section 4credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water into which the potw discharges the potw may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result 4when a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations an industrial user may request that the potw convert the limits to equivalent mass limits the determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the potw the potw

2continue to record the facilitys flow rates use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device  3continue to record the facilitys production rates and notify the potw whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline production rates 4continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to those in division o 4a of this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit gwhen developing equivalent mass limits the potw 1will calculate the equivalent mass limits by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated processes of the industrial user by the concentrationbased daily maximum and monthly average standard for the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor  2upon notification of a revised production rate will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility  and 3may retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent individual wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial users actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies and the actual average daily flow rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limits were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment the industrial user must also be in compliance with f regarding the prohibition of bypass 5the potw may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 cfr parts 414 419 and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users the conversion is at the discretion of the potw 6once included in its permit the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived 7many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average or fourday average limitations where such standards are being applied the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation 8any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a productionbased standard shall notify the potw within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month any user not notifying the potw of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate pnonsignificant categorical user the potw may determine that an industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards is a non significant categorical industrial user rather than a significant categorical industrial user on a finding that the industrial user never discharges more than 100 gallons per day gpd of total categorical wastewater excluding sanitary noncontact cooling and boiler blow down wastewater unless specifically included in the pretreatment standard and the following conditions are met 1the industrial user prior to the potws finding has consistently complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards and requirements  2the industrial user annually submits the required certification statement together with any additional information necessary to support the certification statement  and 3the industrial user never discharges any untreated concentrated wastewater 4if the iu is located upstream of a combined or sanitary sewer overflow the following additional requirements must be met of the application of this classification athe iu cannot discharge wastewater that is regulated by categorical pretreatment standards or  bmust not have been in significant noncompliance at any time in the past two years cprocedures for categorization of an iu as a nonsignificant categorical industrial user and the issues related to combined sewer overflows must be addressed the long term control plan approved combined system operation plan implementing the nine minimum controls or the program modification request 5the potw must evaluate and document at least once per year whether the industrial user continues to meet the requirements for the classification 6upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in p1 4 has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the potws operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement the potw may at any time on its own initiative or in response to a petition received from an industrial user and in accordance with procedures in 40 cfr 4038f6 determine that such user should not be considered a significant industrial user qmidtier categorical industrial users a categorical industrial user may be considered a

2the ius flow must be measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the iu discharges in batches 3the iu must not have been in significant noncompliance for any time in the past two years 4the daily flow rates production levels or pollutant levels of the iu cannot vary so significantly that decreasing the reporting requirement would result in data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period 5if the iu is located upstream of a combined or sanitary sewer overflow procedures for categorization of an iu as a midtier categorical industrial user

at its discretion an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard except for centralized waste treatment facilities regulated by and defined in 40 cfr 437 to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard 1monitoring waivers do not apply to pollutants where certifications processes and requirements are established by the potw or by categorical pretreatment standards eg a total organics management plans certification alternative to sampling unless allowed for by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard 2if a waived pollutant is found

responds to the unique characteristics of the site and its surroundings while better fulfilling the needs of both the community and applicant than conventional zoning and subdivision standards permit puds will accomplish this by allowing and encouraging a flexibility in design and location of structures  b a mixture of types of structures and uses on a single development site  c an effective use of land to facilitate the more efficient arrangement of buildings traffic circulation systems and utilities  d a development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography geologic features scenic vistas trees and other vegetation and which prevents the disruption of natural drainage patterns  e a more usable and suitably located area for recreation facilities open space and other public and common facilities than would otherwise be provided under conventional land development regulations  f a development pattern in harmony with surrounding land use and community development objectives outlined in the comprehensive plan  g a harmonious design amongst the various elements and uses within the development while mitigating any potential negative impact on surrounding properties  and h increased attention to architectural design that will contribute to the overall character of vandalia 122202 scope and applicability a the intent of the pud regulations is to provide a means for applying comprehensive and flexible planning and design techniques on properties substantially sized to accommodate such a plan as such the minimum size of any pud project or plan shall be ten acres b puds are encouraged for largescale developments that will have a mixture of uses including a mixture of housing types that are not all permitted within a single zoning district but where the pud process will provide for a uniform review and set of standards that will create a cohesive wellplanned part of the city c the planning commission may authorize a pud application on lots less than ten acres if the land is currently located in the mbo or db district or where there proposed uses are of such a density or intensity that would not be otherwise permitted under a base zoning district in this code but is otherwise envisioned as part of the comprehensive plan d pud applications shall not be applied to small lots or areas as a means of bypassing traditional zoning district
