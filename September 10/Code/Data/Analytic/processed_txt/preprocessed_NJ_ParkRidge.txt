circumstance except that such discipline is not required for an employee who a voluntarily admits his or her drug use b completes counseling or an eap c thereafter refrains from drug use 2 because the order permits an agency to create a safe harbor for an employee who meets all three of these conditions the borough has decided to create such a safe harbor and will not initiate disciplinary action against employees who satisfy the provisions of this section 3 a fundamental purpose of the borough of park ridges drugfree workplace plan is to assist employees who themselves are seeking treatment for drug use for this reason the borough of park ridge will not initiate disciplinary action against any employee who meets all three of these conditions a voluntarily identifies himselfherself as a user of illegal drugs prior to being identified by other means b obtains counseling or rehabilitation eap  128 park ridge code  128   129 random testing c thereafter refrains from using illegal drugs 4 this selfreferral option allows any employee to step forward and identify himselfherself as an illegal drug user for the purpose of entering a drug treatment program under the eap in stepping forward and consistent with  128f an employee may volunteer for a drug test as a means of identification although this selfidentification test may yield a verified positive test result such result shall not subject an employee to discipline assuming the three safe harbor requirements are met 5 since the key to this provisions rehabilitative effectiveness is an employees willingness to admit his

found to have used illegal drugs pursuant to this chapter a sensitive positions designated for random testing the executive order requires random testing for employees in sensitive positions subject

designated positions subject to random testing the position titles designated for random drug testing are listed in the definition of employees in sensitive positions along with the criteria and procedures applied in designating such positions for drug testing including justification for such criteria and procedures b determining the testing designated position 1 among the factors the mayor

critical safety or security responsibilities the job functions associated with the positions protect life and property or law enforcement these positions are  128 general provisions  129   1210

in a leave status sick administrative or leave without pay b in official travel status away from the test site or is about to embark on official travel scheduled prior to testing notification 2 an employee whose random drug test is deferred will be subject to an unannounced test within the following 60 days a grounds  129 park ridge code  1210   1211 applicant testing 1 reasonable suspicion
