inspections for ten years cthe amount of the deposit to the fund shall be converted to present worth of the annual series values the city engineer shall determine the present worth equivalents which shall be subject to the approval of the governing body the required deposit would be equal to an amount that with interest would generate sufficient income annually to pay the maintenance and inspection costs over ten years if the estimated maintenanceinspection cost is five hundred dollars $50000 per year instead of requiring a deposit of five thousand dollars $5000 $50000 x 10 years the deposit would be reduced to three thousand six hundred ninety dollars $3690 with the present worth approach assuming a six percent annual interest rate and that the funds would be reduced to zero at the end of ten years 2if a storage facility is proposed that also serves as a recreation facility eg a ballfield a lake the city may reduce or waive the amount of the maintenance fund deposit based upon the value of the land for public recreation purposes 3if at some future time a storage facility whether publicly or privately owned is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or other
