risk of being observed such design features may include but not be limited to the placement of doors and windows that look out on to streets and parking areas and designs that encourage pedestrians and onlookers to use sidewalks paths and front yard areas natural surveillance is also facilitated by adequate sightlines and lighting 2 territorial reinforcementphysical design that helps to create or extend a sphere of influence which increases offenders sense of risk and legitimate users sense of territorial control physical features that clearly define property lines and distinguish private spaces from public spaces may include but not be limited to the use of such elements as landscape plantings pavement designs and gateway treatments 3 natural access controlphysical strategies that decrease crime opportunity by denying or delaying access to crime targets and creating a perception of increased effort and risk in offenders streets sidewalks building entrances and neighborhood gateways should be utilized to clearly indicate public routes and discourage access to private or offlimit areas with structural elements target hardening may also be achieved by the use of physical features that prohibit or delay entry or access including for example window locks door dead bolts and metal door frames bollards gates and planters 4 the use of dead space for activities and

they include type of use density intensity height general appearance and aesthetics odors noise smoke vibration traffic generation and nuisances the town manager shall recommend whether the conditional use is compatible compatibility shall be measured based on all of the following characteristics of the proposed use or development in relationship to surrounding development in the immediate area i permitted uses structures and activities allowed within the land use category  ii building location dimensions height and floor area ratio  iii location and extent of parking access drives and service areas  iv traffic generation hours of operation noise levels and outdoor lighting  v alteration of light and air  vi setbacks and buffers such as fences walls landscaping and open

that will make possible the reasonable use of the property and that the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of the applicable zoning regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare 6 the grant of the variance does not permit a use not generally permitted in the district involved or a use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of the regulations of the district in which the affected property lies 7 financial hardship is not a basis for granting a variance unless the failure to grant the variance will render the property unusable as a permitted use in the zoning district in which the property lies f duration 1 such rights and privileges shall be terminated at such time as designated

recognizes that such rights would arise in a circumstance where a all regional roads 1 the agreement provided for the developer to undertake or fund a road improvement which exceeded the developers obligation under any plat approval  and 2 the agreement contains language or evidences of the intent that construction of the road improvement would satisfy the developers obligation to ensure the adequacy of the regional road network with regard to specified development on a described parcel which was not undergoing platting  and 3 the developer acted in reliance upon the agreement and is not in default of the provisions of the agreement b specific road segment 1 the agreement provided for the developer to undertake a road improvement which is unrelated to plat approval  and 2 the

developer constructed the road to service his development without any compensation  and 4 in such circumstances the vested trips on the road segment constructed by the developer shall not exceed the lesser of the number of trips the road improvement can accommodate at level of service d or the number of trips generated on the segment by the intensity or density of development specified in the

dsd it shall be forwarded to the towns attorney for review d a hearing officer shall be appointed to conduct an administrative hearing regarding the vested rights determination the hearing shall be set for no later than 60 days from the date of application unless an extension of time is requested or agreed to by the applicant e the town attorney shall represent the town in the administrative hearing the hearing officer shall determine whether vested rights have been created pursuant to statute or established case law f if the towns attorney any time before the hearing reviews the application and finds that the application has provided clear evidence that vested rights claimed by the developer exist the town attorney and the applicant may stipulate to the existence of vested rights such stipulation shall eliminate the need for a determination by the hearing officer g if vested rights are stipulated to or found by the hearing officer the trips attributable to such vested rights shall be placed within the broward county trips system and shall be available to the benefitted property for a period of five years h a determination by the hearing officer that vested rights
