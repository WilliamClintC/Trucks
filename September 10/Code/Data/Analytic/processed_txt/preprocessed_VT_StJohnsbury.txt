provision hereof or by virtue of existing pollution from the facilities to waters of the state shall be entitled to first priority in allocation of uncommitted reserve capacity new development within or outside the sewer service area will have second priority of uncommitted reserve capacity provided that the development is in the best interest of the town no allocation of reserve capacity shall be made for facilities outside the sewer service area existing on the date of adoption of this the board finds that the extension of the sewers and the proposed development is in the best interest of the town d subsequent to application of the allocation priority uncommitted reserve capacity in the sewage treatment plant may be allocated to specific projects according to the procedures established by the board e building sewer connection permit applications shall be filed in the town clerks office and marked with the time and date by the person receiving the application thereafter the board shall review the applications on a first come first serve basis the total remaining uncommitted wastewater reserve capacity shall be allocated by the board in such a way that there are no limitations on what total reserve amounts can be allocated in any one year as long as uncommitted capacity exists and no limitation of the type of development receiving the allocation the total reserve capacity will be determined each six 6 months and committed reserve will be continuously recorded for use in allocation decisions f the board retains the right to review applications and make allocations on other than a firstcomefirstserve basis if they find such action is in the towns best interest cost recovery for town sewer expansion 125 any expansion of the town sewer service area to provide for new users shall be funded by the proposed users paying the portion of the cost of the expansion and upgrade of the town sewers determined appropriate by the board in determining this portion the board may

along rivers streams and shorelines that are subject to periodic flooding the federal emergency management agency fema has assigned risk zones to more than 19000 communities in the united states this system of classification allows each community to participate in the agencys national flood insurance program nfip with premium rates determined based upon the zone classification the land area covered by the floodwaters of the base flood is the special flood hazard area sfha on nfip maps the sfha is the area where the national flood insurance programs nfips floodplain management regulations must be enforced and the area where the mandatory purchase of flood insurance applies the sfha includes zones a ao ah a130 ae a99 ar ara130 arae arao arah ara vo v130 ve and v the flood insurance rate maps firm show areas within a 100year flood boundary a 100 year flood area does not refer to a flood that occurs every 100 years but refers to a level of flooding that has a 1 percent or greater probability of occurring or being exceeded in any given year these 100year flood areas are termed special flood hazard areas sfhas sfhas are further divided into insurance risk rate zones areas between the 100year and 500year flood boundaries are classified as moderate flood hazard areas minimal flood hazard areas represent those remaining areas that lie above the 500year flood level surprisingly about onethird of all claims paid by the nfip are for areas identified as minimal or moderate risk for flooding largely the result of inadequate drainage systems a regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height communities must regulate development in these floodways to ensure that there are no increases in upstream flood elevations for streams and other watercourses where fema
