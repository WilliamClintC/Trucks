and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in  3581 hereof a land development activities and associated increases in site impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition b this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species c clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat d improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation e impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow f substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality g stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities h the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety i regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing stormwater management and site design will produce development compatible with the natural

that there are some uses which because of their very nature are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances thereby having a deleterious effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood the primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one area 2 the unrestrained proliferation of such businesses is inconsistent with existing development and future plans for the village of sleepy hollow in that they often result in influences on the community which increase the crime rate and undermine the economic moral and social welfare of the community the deleterious effects of these businesses change the economic social and moral character of the existing community and adversely affect existing businesses and community and family life as business activity drops off and the quality of life deteriorates merchants and families move away from the area leaving it in a vacant and depressed state 3 it is further declared that the location of these uses in regard to areas where our youth may regularly assemble and the general atmosphere encompassing their operation is of great concern to the village of sleepy hollow 4 adult entertainment use businesses exhibit such characteristics special regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects

wireless communications towers and antennas and satellite dishes 2 goals a the goals of this section are  to establish clear standards for the siting of wireless communications facilities buildings and structures equipment communications towers antenna towers and monopoles  to promote the health safety and general welfare of the residents of sleepy hollow establishment of minimum standards to reduce the adverse visual effect of communications facilities including but not limited to transmission towers and antennas use of advanced technology careful design siting and screening and buffering  to protect residential areas and land uses and property values from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas  to encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them to the extent possible in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal  to require users of communications towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes adverse visual aesthetic and community character intrusion impacts caused by the installation and view of communications towers and antennas design siting landscape screening and buffering sufficient setbacks to 77editors note original 7 nonconformity which immediately followed this subsection was repealed 1222013 by ll no 12013  45055 sleepy hollow code  45056  reduce visual impacts to adjacent property and innovative camouflaging techniques such as alternative tower structures thereby protecting the physical appearance of the community and preserving its scenic and natural beauty  to enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly effectively and efficiently  to minimize the total number of communications facilities and communications towers throughout the community  to encourage the joint use of new and existing communications tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional singleuse communications towers while recognizing that collocation on higher towers is not always preferable to two less visible less obtrusive shorter towers  thereby maximizing the use of existing communications towers or alternative antenna host sites  however not unreasonably limiting competition among communications providers nor unreasonably limiting reception of receiveonly antennas  to assure the integrity and financial soundness of any communications facility firm seeking to build a wireless communications facility in the village of sleepy hollow  to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
