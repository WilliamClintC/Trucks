title this chapter shall be known as the white township adult business  b purpose pursuant to the authority granted in the second class township promote and secure the health cleanliness comfort and safety of the citizens of white township to regulate and inspect the use and occupancy of public buildings to regulate places of public entertainment amusement and recreation and to prevent and prohibit public nuisances due to adverse secondary effects white township hereafter township enacts this chapter to minimize and control the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of its citizens protect the citizens property values and character of surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of blight 1 the board of supervisors has determined that licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation 2 the board of supervisors does not intend this chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the first amendment but to enact a content neutral ordinance that addresses the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses it is not the intent of the board of supervisors in enacting this chapter to deny any person rights of speech protected by the constitution of the united states or the constitution of pennsylvania or both nor is it the intent of the board of supervisors to impose by this chapter any additional limitations or restrictions on the contents of any communicative materials including sexually oriented films videotapes books and other materials further by enacting this chapter the board of supervisors does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain or view or both any sexually oriented materials or conduct protected by the constitution of the united states or the  631 white code  751  constitution of pennsylvania or both nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of sexually oriented materials may have to sell distribute or exhibit these materials c legislative findings the board of supervisors finds 1 law enforcement personnel have determined and statistics and studies performed in a substantial number of communities in this commonwealth and in the united states indicate that sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects including those specified and recognized at 68 pacsa  5501a which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare these secondary effects include but are not limited to the spread of communicable diseases performance of sexual acts in public places presence of discarded sexually oriented materials on public and private property sexual harassment obscenity prostitution and other illegal sexual activities crime decreased property values and neighborhood deterioration 2 based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in depositions and hearings conducted by the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania case no 3cv991801 judge munley and by the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania case no 981140 judge lancaster and in reports made available to the township and on findings incorporated in the cases of city of renton v playtime theaters inc 475 us 41 1986 young v american mini theaters 426 us 50 1976 and barnes v glen theater inc 501 us 560 1991 and on studies in other communities including but not limited to phoenix arizona  minneapolis minnesota  houston texas  indianapolis indiana  amarillo texas  biloxi mississippi  seattle washington  oklahoma city oklahoma  cleveland ohio and beaumont texas and also on findings from the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the township finds a sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises b certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this chapter as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments  751 general provisions  751  c sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at sexually oriented businesses especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows furthermore adult bookstores tend to attract homosexual men who engage in unprotected highrisk sexual activities d offering and providing such space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions e persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses f at least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hvaids genital herpes hepatitis b non a non b amebiasis salmonella infections and shigella infections g the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infections may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn h according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts i sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities j numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films k numerous studies have indicated that sexually oriented businesses have a substantial negative impact on property values and cause neighborhood blight l the findings noted in 2a k raise substantial governmental concerns 3 sexually oriented businesses have adverse secondary effects in the nature of a public nuisance which secondary effects should be regulated to protect the public health safety and welfare  751 white code  751  4 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 5 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented business further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the township it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 6 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters and bookstores 7 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 8 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases 9 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct that this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 10 the fact that an applicant for an adult or sexually oriented use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant is likely to engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter 11 the barring of such individuals from the management of sexually oriented uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases  751 general provisions  751   752 definitions as used in this chapter the following words and phrases shall have the meanings
