chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material for example city manager can be added between 204 city council and city attorney section of the code contains substantive ordinance material the sections are numbered by tens to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering tables of contents there are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating

of land while accommodating very low density residential development generally associated with agricultural uses this district is designed to maintain complete agricultural uses within the oskaloosa extraterritorial jurisdiction in addition land included in the urban reserve in the comprehensive plan should be retained in the ag district to prevent premature or inappropriate development rr rural residential this district provides for the rural residential use of land accommodating very low and low density residential environments the districts regulations assure that density is developed consistent with land use polices of the oskaloosa comprehensive plan regarding rural subdivisions  levels of infrastructure  and environmentally sensitive development practices the district also accommodates developments that merge urban living with rural life r1 singlefamily residential this district is intended to provide for residential development characterized by singlefamily dwellings on large lots with supporting community facilities and urban services its regulations are intended to minimize traffic congestion and to assure that density is consistent with the carrying capacity of
