plans and plans for other neighborhood improvements 2 the exhibits shall clearly show all proposed improvements so that full consideration may be given to them in village planning commission valuations skillful arrangement of improvements and their suitable adoption to topography produce both substantial savings in construction costs and maximum values in the completed properties  19911 subdivision of land  19912  3 to avoid wasted effort final development plans should be prepared by competent professionals but only after the sponsors preliminary subdivision plan has been accepted by the local authorities 4 if a development is sectioned the final development plans shall be prepared separately for each section as construction progresses rather than for the entire development at one time each successive section must have sufficient area and proper boundaries to provide street traffic circulation and satisfactory drainage without depending upon proposed future construction of other sections b custom building where land development is for individualized custom building the developers final development plans should show only the neighborhood improvements for which he is responsible these are not only the offlot improvements but also those onlot improvements necessary to make each lot a buildable site independent of other lots an example of the latter is rough grading of a block area to establish a workable pattern for surface drainage c operative building by others 1 where land development is for the sale of groups of lots to others for operative building the land developers final development plans are similar to the above for custom building for these developments however each operative builder furnishes for his own part of the development a master plot plan 2 the master plot plan and master lot grading plan show the relationship of the improvements on each individual lot to the street and to adjoining properties they permit each property to be studied and adjusted in relation to nearby properties to resolve potential grading and drainage problems and to obtain a sound attractive development these master plans may be prepared by adding data directly on translucent prints of the original drawing of the accepted preliminary subdivision plan provided that it is at an appropriate scale no smaller than one inch equals 50 feet 3 all information which is basically the same for each of a number of properties of a single type should be shown on a single typical plot plan however special lot conditions will always require the preparation of individualized plot planning data either on the master plot plan if its scale permits or on an enlarged portion of the master plot plan or on individual plot plans as required in the minimum property standards d development combined with building where the same firm does both the land development and all the home building in the tract the data required on the final development plans is the same as outlined above for operative building by others since all is done by the same firm however the data may be prepared either on a series of drawings as indicated above or on a single drawing the single composite  19912 village of colonie code  19912  development plan is preferred because it is easier to prepare and analyze and is more useful during construction and inspection the scale shall be one inch equals 50 feet e special types the kind and the extent of information to be shown on the final development plans vary for different developments according to existing conditions and the characteristics of the development  19912 subdivision of land  19912  article iv modifications and variances  19913 applications  grant by planning commission  19914 request for reconsideration any
