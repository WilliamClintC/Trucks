conditions attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country moreover it is the finding of the city commission that public nudity either partial or total under certain circumstances particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in socalled nude bars or establishments offering socalled nude entertainment or adult entertainment begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct prostitution drug trafficking and drug use among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this section and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas furthermore the public health safety and welfare require that adult entertainment establishments and their locations operations and employees be regulated and licensed in order to reduce the potential for harm and in order to preserve the quality of urban life in residential and business areas of the community therefore the limitation of adult uses and adult entertainment to certain prescribed areas of the city is in the public welfare and it is

of these regulations are to encourage the conservation of existing tree canopy and provide minimum requirements for the protection maintenance and renewal of tree canopy cover across the city the city believes that trees are an essential part of the communitys infrastructure and recognizes that they provide measurable and valuable services and benefits to our community these services and benefits include 1 improved health of decaturs citizens and visitors  2 improved air quality  3 improved water quality  4 improved soil quality  5 stormwater control  6 energy conservation  7 increased property values  8 habitat for desirable wildlife  9 noise and glare buffering  10 privacy screening  11 increased community aesthetics and quality of life  and 12 increased shade for active living activities like walking and biking b the city recognizes that trees and tree canopy are a community resource that requires active conservation and replanting efforts the purpose of these regulations is to provide a basic framework for maintaining conserving and increasing tree canopy cover across the city the citys tree canopy cover will be measured every 5 years previous measurements of tree canopy showed 457% tree canopy cover in 2005 and 451% tree canopy cover in 2010 the next measurement will be made in 2014 of the 2014 tree canopy cover and then every 5 years thereafter of the

and redevelopment in the city the requirements for a postdevelopment stormwater management plan which is required in order to undertake land development activities the plan shall contain the details of how the development will address postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and quantity impacts resulting from the permanent alteration of the character and hydrology of the land surface as well as the nonpoint source pollution from land use activities the outlines the water quantity and quality performance design criteria for managing this runoff and specifies local requirements for the use of structural stormwater controls and nonstructural practices in order to protect public health and safety  for the protection of public and private property and infrastructure and for the protection of the environment ongoing longterm inspection and maintenance provisions are also required by this majority of technical criteria and standards required by this adopted by reference use of the georgia stormwater management design manual as may be amended by local requirements contained in the citys stormwater management policy guidelines   introduction it is hereby determined that a land development projects and other land use conversions and their associated changes to land cover permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes which in turn increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition  b land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters  c the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality can affect public safety public and private property drinking water supplies recreation fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters  these adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and redevelopment by the use of both structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures such as the conservation of open space and greenspace areas the preservation and protection of natural area and greenspace for stormwater management benefits is encouraged use of incentives or credits the georgia greenspace program provides a mechanism for the preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas which provide stormwater management quality and quantity benefits  d localities in the state of georgia are required to comply with a number of both state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution  e therefore the city has established this set of stormwater management policies to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of postdevelopment stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation it has determined that it is in the public interest to regulate postdevelopment stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes postconstruction soil erosion and sedimentation stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with postdevelopment stormwater runoff   general provisions a purpose and intent the purpose of this to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment it has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure safeguard the public health safety environment and general welfare of the public and protect water and aquatic resources this to meet that purpose following objectives 1 establish decisionmaking processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources  2 require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding stream bank erosion nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream temperature and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats  3 establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality  4 establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards  5 encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum extent practicable coordinate site design plans which include greenspace with the countys greenspace protection plan  6 encourage preservation of existing tree canopy by reducing the applicable postdevelopment stormwater management performance criteria as specified in  encourage the use of green infrastructure and low impact development practices as defined in the coastal supplement to the georgia stormwater management by reducing the applicable postdevelopment stormwater management performance criteria as specified in  require new developments and redeveloped properties that generate concentrated stormwater flows to connect to nearby storm sewer systems via underground conveyance  9 require new developments and redeveloped properties that generate concentrated stormwater flows to discharge aboveground flows into a stabilized engineered channel from the point of release to the point of connection to the public stormwater system if connection to such storm sewer system via underground conveyance is not feasible  10 manage runoff impacts to adjacent properties by requiring post development runoff to be directed away from existing adjacent structures and released in a manner similar to the existing condition and by maintaining a drainage path for any existing offsite runoff that drains site  and 11 establish provisions for the longterm responsibility for maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices green infrastructure practices low impact development practices and maintaining existing treescanopies to be preserved to ensure that they continue to function as designed are maintained and pose no threat to public safety  and 12 establish administrative procedures for the submission review approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans and for the inspection of approved active projects and longterm follow up b additional requirements the list above is a general set of objectives to reduce the impacts of postdevelopment stormwater runoff quantity and quality from land development activities the city may establish additional requirements in the stormwater management policy guidelines which set more specific objectives based upon a watershed management plan

involves the designation of floodprone areas and the managing of their uses it is also aimed at minimizing modifications to streams reducing flood hazards and protecting the beneficial uses of the floodplain such as water quality protection as such floodplain management can be seen as a subset of the larger consideration of surface water and stormwater management b floodplain regulations and development restrictions can greatly reduce future flooding impacts preserve greenspace and habitat and protect their function in safely conveying floodwaters and protecting water quality this to help communities integrate floodplain management with stormwater management during the land development process   introduction it is hereby determined that a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management water quality stream bank protection stream corridor protection wetland preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas c effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize damage to private property  3 minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  and 4 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public d of the constitution of the state of georgia and a of the official georgia annotated have delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city commission establishes this set of floodplain management and flood hazard reduction provisions for the purpose of regulating the use of flood hazard areas it is determined that the regulation of flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety as well as to private and public property   general provision a purpose and intent the purpose of this to protect maintain and enhance the public health safety environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas as well as to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection stream bank and stream corridor protection wetlands preservation and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to 1 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  2 restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to flooding or erosion hazards or which increase flood heights velocities or erosion  3 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion  4 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands  5 limit the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  and 6 protect the stormwater management water quality stream bank protection stream corridor

aggrieved by a decision or order of the udo administrator may file an appeal to the zoning board of appeals pursuant to the provisions of illicit discharge and illegal connection   description an illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system stormwater drainage system that is not composed entirely of stormwater runoff except for discharges allowed under an npdes permit or nonpolluting flows these nonstormwater discharges occur due to illegal dumping or illegal connections to the stormwater drainage system this the city with the authority to deal with illicit discharges and establishes enforcement actions for those persons or entities found to be in noncompliance or that refuse to allow access to their facilities   introduction it is hereby determined that a discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters  b these nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills dumping and improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from residential industrial commercial or institutional establishments  c these nonstormwater discharges not only impact waterways individually but geographically dispersed small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters  d the impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and safety drinking water supplies recreation fish and other aquatic life property values and other uses of lands and waters  e these impacts can be minimized regulation of spills dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system  f localities in the state of georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution due to improper nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system  g therefore the city adopts this prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system it is determined that the regulation of spills improper dumping and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety and the environment

professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and submitted to the city commissioners properly assess and define the stormwater management problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities of the city 2 given the problems needs goals program priorities and funding opportunities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city it is appropriate to authorize the establishment of a separate accounting unit which shall be dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems in the city 3 stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city intense urban development in the city has radically altered the natural hydrology of the area and the hydraulics of stormwater systems with many natural elements having been replaced or augmented by manmade facilities as a result the specific service system and facility demands in the city now exceed the service capability of many of the systems an advanced level of service is needed in the city due to its urbanization therefore a stormwater utility service area subject to stormwater service charges should encompass the entirety of the city to enable the city to successfully manage operate and improve stormwater systems at an advanced level 4 it is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater service level continue to be funded from the citys general tax revenues and therefore that the city commissioners may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service charge payments for cityowned properties and a supplemental allocation of general fund funding 5 the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare funding of stormwater services and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health safety and welfare 6 provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities renders andor results in both service and benefit to individual properties property owners citizens and residents of the city and to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses and the service and benefits differ among the individual properties property owners citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems 7 the service and benefit rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater programs systems and facilities and risk exposure it is not practical to allocate the cost of the citys stormwater management programs systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the longterm demands they impose on the citys stormwater programs systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits 8 the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed installed and acquired mechanisms over many years the future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and of future additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs 9 the city commissioners find conclude and determine that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services and benefits throughout the city and the most equitable means to fund an advanced level of stormwater services in the city service charges and other mechanisms as described in the professional engineering and financial analyses prepared for the city b establishment of a utility and an enterprise fund 1 there is hereby established a stormwater utility which shall be responsible for stormwater management programs throughout the city and which shall provide for the management protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities the stormwater utility management unit shall be composed of such personnel employees and agents of the city as the city commissioners may from time to time determine and their compensation shall be fixed and determined by the city manager as approved by the city commissioners 2 a stormwater enterprise fund shall be established in the city budget and accounting system for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility including but not limited to rentals rates charges fees and licenses as may be established by the city commissioners and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility all revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater enterprise fund and all expenses of the utility shall be paid from the stormwater enterprise fund except that other revenues receipts and resources not accounted for in the stormwater utility enterprise fund may be applied to stormwater management programs facilities operations and capital investments as deemed appropriate by the city commissioners upon recommendation by the city manager 3 the city commissioners hereby confer upon the stormwater utility operational control over the existing stormwater management programs systems and facilities performed provided or owned and heretofore operated by the city and other related assets including but not limited to properties other than roadways upon which such systems and facilities are located easements rightsofentry and access and certain equipment used solely for stormwater management c scope of responsibility 1 the city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation maintenance and improvement of those stormwater systems and facilities which a are located within public streets rightsofway and easements  b are subject to easements rightsofentry rightsofaccess rightsofuse or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation maintenance andor improvement of systems and facilities  or c are located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation

shall be equitably derived which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater program systems and facilities by individual properties or persons andor the level of service rendered by or resulting from the provision of stormwater programs systems and facilities stormwater service charge rates shall be structured so as to be fair and reasonable and the resultant service charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing services and facilities similarly situated properties shall be charged similar rentals rates charges fees

public stormwater systems or facilities 4 stormwater utility service charge rates fees and other similar charges shall be established by the city commissioners stormwater management rates   findings the city commissioners of the city make the following findings of fact a the professional engineering and financial analyses conducted on behalf of and considered by the city commissioners properly assess define and project the cost of stormwater management systems and facilities of the city b given the projected cost of stormwater management programs systems and facilities identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses submitted to the city it is appropriate to adopt a stormwater service fee rate methodology and to charge service fees to properties and persons within the city in a manner that recovers the cost of programs systems and facilities and other costs associated therewith including but not limited to allocations of the cost of services provided to the stormwater management utility by other funds of the city and other government entities and agencies interest on bonds operational and emergency reserves allowances for delinquencies and bad debt and such other costs as may be deemed reasonable and appropriate by the city commissioners of the city to ensure the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater programs systems and facilities in the city c stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the city and the stormwater service fee rate methodology and service fees should be applicable throughout the city to enable the city to successfully manage operate and improve stormwater programs systems and facilities at an advanced level d it is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater program systems and facilities continue to be funded from the citys general tax revenues and therefore that the city commissioners may allocate general fund support to stormwater management in the future in the form of a combination of service fee payments for cityowned properties and a supplemental allocation of the general fund e the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protecting the public health safety and welfare funding of stormwater programs systems and facilities is therefore incidental to the fundamental regulatory function of the city in protecting the public health safety and welfare f provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities renders andor results in both services and benefits to individual properties property owners citizens and residents of the city and to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city concurrently in a variety of ways as identified in the professional engineering and financial analyses and the services and benefits differ among the individual properties property owners citizens and residents in relation to the demands they impose individually and collectively on the stormwater systems and facilities g the services and benefits rendered or resulting from the provision of stormwater management programs systems and facilities may differ over time depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater systems and facilities and risk exposure it is not practical to allocate the cost of the citys stormwater management programs systems and facilities in direct relationship to the services or benefits rendered to or received by individual properties or persons over a brief span of time but it is both practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among properties and persons in proportion to the longterm demands they impose on the citys stormwater programs systems and facilities which render or result in services and benefits h the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed installed and acquired mechanisms over many years the future usefulness and value of the existing stormwater systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and of future additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance the stormwater systems and facilities in the city in order to do so the city must have adequate and stable funding for its stormwater management program operating and capital investment needs   stormwater service fee rates stormwater service fee rates may be determined and modified from time to time by the city commissioners of the city so that the total revenue generated by said fees and any other sources of revenues or other resources allocated to stormwater management by the city commissioners shall be sufficient to meet the cost of stormwater management programs systems and facilities including but not limited to the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations operating expense capital outlays nonoperating expense provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city commissioners of the city stormwater service fee revenues in any given year may exceed or be less than the cost of service in that year provided however that the stormwater service fee rate shall be based on meeting the longterm projected cost of stormwater
