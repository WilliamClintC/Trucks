authorization the legislature of the state has pursuant to nmsa 197  3187 delegated the responsibility to local governments to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain and adopt this chapter a11 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage a12   51402 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area a13   51402 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purpose this chapter uses the following methods of reducing flood losses 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands a14 lands to which this chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city a31 basis for establishing areas of special flood hazard the areas of special flood hazard were originally identified by the federal emergency management agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled the flood insurance study for farmington new mexico dated march 197 with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and flood boundaryfloodway maps firm and fbfm the revision of the flood insurance study for san juan county new mexico and incorporated areas dated  with accompanying flood insurance rate maps dated  are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter a32   852010 compliance no structure or land shall be located altered or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations a34 abrogation and greater restrictions this chapter is not intended to repeal abrogate or impair any existing easements covenants or deed restrictions however where this chapter and another section of this ordinance easement covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail a35   51402 interpretation in the interpretation and application of this chapter all sections shall be considered as minimum requirements liberally construed in favor of the city council and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes a36 warning and disclaimer of liability the degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations on rare occasions greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes this chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages this chapter shall not create liability on the part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made under this chapter a37 article 2

temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user an upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation 2 an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection a3 of this section are met 3 a user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that a an upset occurred and the user can identify the cause of the upset  b the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and c the user has submitted the following information to the environmental coordinator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset  if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five days 1 a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  2 the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and 3 steps being taken and

will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards 6 a user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced lost or fails b prohibited discharge standards a user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in subsection 263111a or the specific prohibitions in subsection 263111b if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources would cause pass interference and that either 1 a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass interference  or 2 no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the users prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its npdes permit and in the case of interference was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements c bypass 1 the following words terms and phrases when used in this subsection shall have the following meanings except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning a bypass means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a users treatment facility b severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production 2 a user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation these bypasses are not subject to subsections c3 and 4 of this section 3 if a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass it shall submit prior notice to the environmental coordinator at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible a a user shall submit oral notice to the environmental coordinator of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass a written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass the written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause  the duration of the bypass including exact dates and times and if the bypass has not been corrected the anticipated time it is expected to continue  and steps taken or planned to reduce eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass the environmental coordinator may waive the written report on a casebycase basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours 4 bypass is prohibited and the environmental coordinator may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass unless a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  b there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance  and c the user submitted notices as required under subsection c3 of this section d the environmental coordinator may approve an anticipated bypass after considering its adverse effects if the environmental coordinator determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection c4a of this section  111312 wastewater treatment rates a a hauled wastewater user shall pay such fees to the city for

principal uses 1 when all principal uses of a development fall within one use category the entire development is assigned to that use category a development that contains a coffee shop bookstore and bakery for example would be classified in the retail sales and service category entertainmentoriented because all of the developments principal uses are in that category 2 when the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to all applicable regulations for that category in a development that contains a coffee shop bookstore and gas station for example the coffee shop and bookstore would be classified in the retail sales and service entertainmentoriented category however the service

development in areas of special flood hazards within the corporate limits of the city of farmington  statutory authority the legislature of the state has pursuant to nmsa 197  3187 delegated the responsibility to local governments to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city council does ordain and adopt this section  general provisions a findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage b methods of reducing flooding in order to accomplish its purpose this section uses the following methods of reducing flood losses 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or that cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands c basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard the

two dominant native plant communities in farmington pion juniper woodland and riparian corridors the pion juniper woodland occurs in the higher elevations towards the northern part of town and the riparian corridor occurs along the river corridor of the valley floor the limited amount of annual rainfall eight inchesten inches received in farmington means that most plants require some level of supplemental water landscapers are encouraged to use plants that are adapted to our environment indigenous or native to similar climates of the world and require low amounts of water given the characteristics of farmingtons natural environment xeriscaping or the use of waterefficient landscaping is the most appropriate form of landscape design in a lowprecipitation high desert environment a xeriscape is not a zeroscape xeriscaping emphasizes the use of plants adapted to dry conditions and is neither a barren nor a maintenance free landscape plants utilized in xeriscaping tend to be xeric meaning that they require little supplemental water xeros is greek for dry xeriscaping utilizes several design principles to ensure that the created landscapes are suitable for the local climate and are water efficient the principles applied in xeriscaping are good horticultural practices for our desert environment the seven xeriscape principles are 1 planning and design  2 efficient irrigation systems  3 use of mulch  4 soil preparation  5 appropriate turf  6 waterefficient plant material  and 7 appropriate maintenance  1 planning and design a good xeriscape landscape begins with good design and initial planning before you put the shovel to the ground it is important to have a landscape plan when creating a landscape plan consider the physical characteristics of the site 1 what kind of soil is found onsite is it rocky sandy or made up of clays 2 what is the topography and how does the area drain is it flat or sloped are there natural drainages 3 is there any existing vegetation or is it a vacant lot 4 what functions is the landscaping to serve will it be used as a play area provide shade or screen views once the site and function of the landscaping is considered select the right plant for the right place when choosing plants consider 1 sun versus shade requirements 2 height and spread of plant materials at maturity 3 the plants function in the landscape ie will it screen views or shade areas also consider whether the desired plant has strong allergens or is an invasive species plants that have strong allergens should be used with caution several species of juniper are considered highly allergic it is against the farmington city fcc to plant the cotton bearing cottonwood fcc  1263 seedless varieties are acceptable to plant russian olive and salt cedar are invasive species that have overpopulated areas along farmingtons river corridor invasive species outcompete native plant species alter habitat and affect ecosystem functions therefore invasive species such as russian olive and salt cedar are discouraged as landscape plants plants with thorns or stickers such as pyracantha are effective barrier plants but should not be used in areas of high traffic do not plant trees under power lines where branches will conflict with the lines before you dig verify all underground utility locations group plants with similar water needs by dividing the landscape into zones of low medium and high water uses water zoning a high water use zone 1 typically these plants are the most colorful and have the greatest visual impact 2 limit plantings to areas near the building by the entry or around a patio 3 works well on the northern and eastern sides of buildings where soils are moister or at runoff points such as down spouts b medium water use zone 1 the transition zone or moderate water use areas should be planted farther away from the house or building 2 require less frequent watering ie once a week or less and usually less maintenance c low water use zone 1 typically located the farthest away from the building 2 use plants that may require little or no supplemental water 3 select natives and other plants requiring little or no water for the low water use zones to help save on water costs water can be harvested from roof down spouts into barrels andor directed or drainage areas within the landscape  2 irrigation proper and efficient irrigation saves water irrigation is required even for drought tolerant plants during the establishment period and periods of severe drought points to remember when designing an irrigation system are 1 separate water use zones for high moderate and low water use plants 2 design irrigation systems with separate valves for each water zone 3 choose the appropriate type of sprinkler heads use spray heads for turf and bubblers drip emitters or microspray heads in shrub beds depending on the density of planting 4 irrigation systems may be manual or automatic an automatic irrigation system saves time and provides better control of watering times maintaining the irrigation system is also important repair all breaks in lines and clogged heads reprogram the irrigation controller as the seasons change adjust spray heads to avoid overspraying onto walks and walls do not allow irrigation water to runoff the landscaped area for more detailed information on how to set up an irrigation system please see the irrigation guidelines section of the appendix  3 mulching mulch is a protective layer applied over soils and may be composed of organic or inorganic material mulch provides a cover over the soil reduces evaporation helps maintain constant soil temperatures controls erosion and limits weeds which compete for water and nutrients a organic mulches include bark wood chips cotton burr hulls other nut shell byproducts compost grass clippings and even newspaper organic mulches provide more than just the benefits mentioned above they also improve soil conditions as they decompose help keep soil structure loose improve water infiltration retain water and allow for better root growth b inorganic mulches include rock cobble gravel or crusher fines and synthetics such as rubber pellets rock mulches radiate heat and are better suited for truly xeric plants placing rock mulches work best in locations removed from a building ultimately plants in rock mulches will shade the ground and cool the environment when using mulches 1 apply a threeinch to fourinch thick layer of mulch to effectively reduce weeds and retain moisture 2 avoid the use of organic mulch on slopes or high wind areas as they will wash or blow away 3 do not apply organic mulches in direct contact with plants leave at least two inches of unmulched area around the plant stem to prevent disease and pests plastic weed barriers can be used in a limited fashion where the soil must be kept dry such as at the foundation of a house however landscape fabric is preferred as it is permeable and allows air and water to pass to the plant roots  4 soil preparation a critical aspect of any gardening function is soil preparation it is important to test the soil first to determine what plants are adaptable to your yard and what amendments are required to improve the soil farmington soils are virtually devoid of organic matter and are typically fastdraining sandy soils the size of the planting hole and the backfill used is an important part in amending soils all planting holes should be at least twice the width of the container  however three times the width is preferred digging wide planting holes loosens the soil which allows air water and nutrients to reach the roots the backfill around the plant should be amended with composted materials such as peat moss composted wood shavings or yard waste adding compost improves the moisture holding capacity in sandy soils and improves the porosity in clay soils over time the compost breaks down and forms humus that improves the structure of the soil be sure to thoroughly mix the native soil and compost before adding to the planting hole the amended soil mixture should include no more than 50 percent compost plants requiring high to moderate water will require the most compost materials native plants require less composted material in the backfill 1530 percent by volume turf areas should be rototilled to a depth of four to six inches and amended with two cubic yards of compost per 1000 square feet limit rototilling to areas being planted as disturbed areas make it easier for weed seeds to germinate  5 appropriate use of turf while it requires more water and maintenance turf has a place in xeriscape turf provides a playing surface for kids and pets is an important cooling element and reduces erosion and sun glare however turf should only be planted in an appropriate amount to meet specific needs if turf is not serving a functional purpose there are other low spreading ground covers can be used to provide a carpet of green that require less water and maintenance proper selection turf used is important if you need a turf for heavy use and a long growing season a fescue or fescuebluegrass mix is preferred if it is a lighter use turf mostly in the summer months a warm season grass such as buffalograss blue grama or bermuda grass is suggested  6 low water use plants the principal concept behind xeriscaping is the use of low water use plants there is a misconception that drought tolerant plants are unattractive the truth is that there are many attractive plants with a variety of flower and foliage colors fruit fall color fragrance with different sizes shapes and uses low water use plants are becoming more available in nurseries a list of perennials vines shrubs and trees are included in these guidelines please visit your local nursery for other drought tolerant plants that are suitable for the farmington area  7 maintenance maintenance in the garden is just good horticultural practice with design dictating the level of maintenance although most xeriscapes require less maintenance a xersicape garden can be as labor intensive as you want it to be the design dictates the level of maintenance there is no such thing as a maintenance free garden plants will always require water and fertilizer pest and weed control and pruning or deadheading scientific name common name approx height approx spead decidiuous

farmington due to the limited annual rainfall received by the city of farmington supplemental irrigation is required to maintain plants in a healthy condition a properly designed automatic irrigation system provides efficient application of water to the landscape below are suggested irrigation guidelines these guidelines should not supersede a consultation with a qualified landscaping professional in designing an irrigation system  irrigation system design basics irrigation systems are designed with hydraulics in mind hydraulic principles such as gallons per minute pounds per square inch friction loss velocity and proper coverage all factor into the design of an irrigation system these principles will be explained as the components of an irrigation system are discussed  water meters most property owners will have a single water meter to service their building and site irrigation lines that tie into the water service downstream of the water meter may require tying into a copper line which requires a licensed plumber to sweat weld a copper tee and an adapter for the irrigation line for large scale landscape projects a separate irrigation only water meter may be installed to prevent a monthly sewer assessment fee if the property has the right to use water from an irrigation ditch installation of a water meter is not required if an existing water meter is in place the volume of water or gallons per minute gpm is determined by the size of the existing water meter if a new meter is being installed the designer determines the meter size based on an acceptable loss of pressure meter generally four to eight pounds of pressure or pounds per square inch psi may be allowed for meter loss pressure loss above this amount will either place undo stress on the meter or loose too much pressure for the system to operate correctly loss of pressure occurs whenever water moves pipe or when water moves uphill against the force of gravity if the total pressure in a piping system exceeds the available static water pressure the water will not flow to help determine the amount of pressure loss expected given a particular meter size and gpm refer to the table on the following page water meter size inches gallons per minute gpm pressure lost psi 58 20 10 58 10 25 1 50 10 1 20 16 1 10 4 source american water works association pressure is lost as water flows of an irrigation system the amount of water that can flow irrigation component is determined by the size of the component and its acceptable pressure loss it is critical that a proper level of pressure is maintained to operate an irrigation system effectively a main lines the main line is the supply line from the point of connection to the control valves this portion of the line is under pressure at all times with the exception of the winter months when the system should be shut off and drained the main line is placed in the ground with a minimum of 18 inches of cover piping used for main lines should be a rigid thick walled material such as pvc poly vinyl chloride schedule 40 or pvc class 315 main lines are sized based on acceptable friction loss as recommended by the manufacturer pressure loss above the acceptable amount will either place undo stress on the main line or loose too much pressure for the system to operate correctly friction loss is based on the velocity of the water running main line velocity is calculated in feet per second fps typically the velocity in a line should not exceed five fps irrigation manufacturers provide friction loss charts to help you determine the proper size of line main lines may be upsized to reduce the amount of pressure loss if low pressure is a concern friction loss is the loss of pressure caused by turbulence created in the water shile traveling pipe b backflow devices once an irrigation connection has been made a backflow device must be installed per unified plumbing contact the citys plumbing inspector to discuss the proper backflow device to be installed for your landscape backflow devices are sized based on an acceptable pressure loss per the manufacturers literature backflow is a reverse flow condition created by a drop in pressure in a distribution line which causes water to flow backwards into the distribution source smaller irrigation systems may use an atmospheric vacuum breaker one per valve placed 6 above the highest head for larger irrigation systems a single backflow device may be installed such as a pressure vacuum breaker a double check valve or a reduced pressure device a pressure vacuum device is installed 6 above the highest head a double check valve or reduced pressure device may be placed at any location onsite irrespective of elevation the unified plumbing a licensed contractor to install backflow devices a backflow device prevents contaminated water from being backsiphoned into a water supply should reverse flow occur atmospheric vacuum breakers pressure vacuum breakers double check valves  and reduced pressure devices are types of backflow devices c control valves control valves turn on and off the water to individual circuits of sprinklers or drip emitters ideally the control valves are wired to an irrigation controller or timer making the system automatic control valves are sized based on the amount of acceptable friction loss typically a control valve is sized one size smaller than the size of the largest lateral line downstream of the valve too little water running oversized valve may result in the control valve not opening properly pressure loss above the acceptable amount will either place undo stress on the control valve or loose too much pressure for the system to operate correctly separate control valves should be used for turf versus shrub beds different types of turf heads  ie spray versus rotors or impacts should be placed on separate valves due to their differing rates of water application ideally shaded areas ie areas with north or east facing exposures should be on separate control valves because of the limited amount of sun they receive drip irrigation lines should also operate on their own special valves which come equipped with a pressure regulator and a filter the term head is short for sprinkler heads spray heads rotor heads impact heads are types of sprinkler heads d irrigation controllers an automatic irrigation system provides a great amount of flexibility in programming your system and reduces the time spent to maintain landscaping irrigation controllers automatically turn on and off your control valves as you have programmed them and will operate irrigation systems at any time of the day or night some controllers even offer multiple start times which can be important in keeping a newly seeded lawn moist or keeping your landscape alive during a hot summer day while most controllers require an electrical source there are battery operated and solar powered controllers for remote locations where electricity is not readily available e lateral lines lateral lines occur downstream of the control valves the lateral lines are placed in the ground with a minimum of 12 inches of cover and usually are made of a rigid material such as pvc class 200 or greater the sizing of lateral lines is also based upon acceptable friction loss pressure loss above the acceptable amount will either place undo stress on the lateral lines or loose too much pressure for the system to operate correctly f poly pipe poly pipe is black flexible tubing that comes in various sizes poly pipe may be used as lateral lines where flexibility is needed poly pipe may also be used as a swing joint at the base of a turf head again friction loss needs to be taken into account when choosing the correct size of poly pipe to use a swing joint is a flexible swivel joint that allows for the installation of heads in difficult locations away from the line g turf heads turf heads come in a variety of configurations with varying radii patterns psi and gpm ratings all turf heads should be popups spray heads have the shortest spray radius and rotor heads which are gear driven and impact heads have larger spray radii turf heads with longer spray radii require greater water pressure and gallonage delivery popups are sprinkler heads that retract below ground level when not in operation turf heads must be placed to provide head to head coverage meaning the radius of one head must reach the base of the adjacent head improper coverage will result in dry spots with diamond and doughnuts or over watering to compensate for the lack of coverage refer to the manufacturers product literature for the proper radius gallons per minute and pressure performances h shrub heads shrub heads also come in a variety of configurations similar to the turf heads shrub beds with dense planting are best suited for spray rotor or impact type heads shrub heads should also be laid out in a head to head coverage pattern for lower density plantings bubblers or drip irrigation may be installed there are adjustable bubblers that can be fine tuned to a slow drip as a quasidrip system without the need for filters pressure regulators and purge valve drip irrigation will be discussed in a separate section bubblers are a type of shrub head shrub heads that occur along walkways or any area where people might walk should be popup type heads this may require a 12inch high pop to clear the adjacent shrubbery i drain valves drain valves are installed to allow for the draining of an irrigation system and can be manual valves or automatic drain valves need to be installed at low points within the main line and lateral lines if automatic drain valves are installed they will open every time pressure in the line drops and drain the system after each irrigation cycle if you dont effectively drain your system for the winter you may be looking a serious repair bill drain valves should not be installed upstream of a backflow device because the opening of the valve may allow for potential contaminants to enter the water supply j drip irrigation drip irrigation provides a slow even application of water that penetrates deep into the soil and promotes drought tolerance in plants drip irrigation systems operate at a rate of gallons per hour gph versus the gallons per minute rate used with standard irrigation systems due to the differing rate of application it is possible that your drip irrigation system will run for hours not minutes drip irrigations systems also operate at lower pressures than standard irrigation all other components of a drip system are similar to those used in a standard system while drip irrigation systems require a higher level of maintenance they are highly efficient in delivering water to plants and help lower water costs k drip control valves like standard irrigation systems a control valve is needed for drip systems however because of the small openings in the tubing and emitters a drip system must have a filter and a pressure regulator as well as a purge valve at the ends of the lines most drip irrigation manufacturers make a combination control valve pressure regulator and filter to meet the needs of your drip system filters and pressure regulators are critical to the proper functioning of a drip irrigation system l drip lines downstream of the drip control valve are the drip lines the drip line is typically a onehalf inch diameter black flexible pipe that can be routed along the ground or buried use a uv resistant drip line if you place the drip line above ground drip lines with emitter devices preset at even intervals are also available this type of drip system requires rows of lines to provide uniform coverage in a shrub bed m drip emitters drip emitters control the flow of water being delivered to the soil emitters come in a variety of shapes and sizes with single or multiple outlets and also vary in gallonage rates a single outlet emitter typically is inserted into the onehalfinch drip line with a barbed fitting it may also be placed on a shrub riser with and adapter a multioutlet emitter six to eight outlets usually is placed on a shrub riser with a tee or an ell on the drip line microspray heads for drip systems have relatively short radii and low gallonage rates often they are used similarly to standard spray heads n drip tubing drip tubing is typically a onequarterinch diameter black flexible tube that is run on the ground from the emitter to the plant ideally the end of the tubing is secured with a stake and closed with a bug cap o purge valves even with a filter at the control valve sediments have a way of clogging the drip system purge valves are ball valves placed at the ends of drip lines to allow for periodic flushing in order to maintain proper functioning of a drip system it is advised that drip lines are purged several times a year retaining walls and slopes  guideline introduction the city of farmington will review retaining wall design for conformance with generally accepted design and construction standards the city of farmington assumes no responsibility or liability for the design construction or long term integrity of the wall review and approval of plans by the city is required in order to obtain a building permit  definitions the following definitions are used in this handout a retaining wall a landscaping technique intended to change the contour or grading of the lot b exposed height the exposed height is measured from grade level to the top of the wall at a given location c problem soils a soil type which may have a high water table expansive clays low weight bearing capacities frost heave potential or other behavioral problems  overview of general requirements construction of any retaining wall with exposed height greater than onefoot six inches 18 inches requires a building permit retaining walls with exposed heights of 36 inches or greater or with a surcharge or a problem soil must be an engineered wall  zoning requirements in addition to the structural review performed by building inspection the development services department will review proposed retaining walls to ensure they meet all required setbacks and height restrictions regulated by the city of farmington approval of setbacks and height requirements are completed prior to applying for a building permit the community development department is located at 805 municipal drive farmington nm 87401 please contact the planning division at 505 5991301 for further information  building permit application and

elevations and exposed height b approval signatures from the planning division c payment of required permit fees d approval by the building inspection department e obtain building permit or permits  retaining wall design guidelines the following guidelines are designed to assist in building structurally sound retaining walls and shorten the process to obtaining permits a site specific conditions to consider include but are not limited to 1 existing soil conditions at the wall location 2 topography 3 surface grade 4 external pressures and surcharges b the city of farmington recommends that retaining walls incorporate the following design principles 1 for each eight feet of vertical height a fourfoot horizontal offset should be provided 2 walls should conform to the topography of the site 3 walls with a change in alignment should incorporate the use of graduating steps rather than sharp corners to the greatest practical extent c additionally as stated in subsection a materials utilized in the construction of retaining walls  walls visible from public rightsofway within the frontyard setbacks shall either incorporate the use of native materials or complement the native surroundings  slopes when constructing a retaining wall along a slope the following should be considered  public utility requirements call one call at 18003212537 before excavating to ensure that the location of construction does not interfere with underground utility lines one call is a free service that marks the path of underground utilities on the property for those who are planning to
