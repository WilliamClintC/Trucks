added 5212007 by   175170 scope and purpose apurpose 1it is hereby determined that aland development projects and associated disturbance of vegetation and soil and changes in land cover including increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes if inadequately or improperly managed this stormwater runoff can deplete groundwater resources and increase flooding stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition bthis stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants cincreases of stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollutants have occurred in the past as a result of land development and contribute to the degradation of the water resources of the town of hammonton dall lands of the town of hammonton lie within the pinelands area and therefore development in the town of hammonton is subject to the requirements of the pinelands protection act njsa a1 et seq and the implementing of regulations and minimum standards contained in the pinelands comprehensive management plan njac 11 et seq cmp the purpose and intent of these regulations and

ecological character and quality of the pinelands including good water quality and natural rates and volumes of flow fincreased stormwater rates and volumes and the sediments and pollutants associated with stormwater runoff from future development projects within the pinelands area have the potential to adversely affect the town of hammontons streams and water resources and the streams and water resources of downstream municipalities gstormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites hit is in the public interest to regulate the discharge of stormwater runoff from major development projects as defined in  175176 of this article conducted within the pinelands area as provided in this article in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes to maintain groundwater recharge and to control and minimize soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff 2therefore it is the purpose of this article to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls for major development consistent with the
