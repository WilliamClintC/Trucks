buildings in order to promote protect enhance perpetuate and preserve those historic resources for the educational cultural economic enjoyment and general welfare of the public the board of commissioners recognizes that existing historic buildings have not been designed in accordance with the requirements of this ordinance and that restricting and limiting such historic buildings to the uses and regulations which would be imposed on newly constructed buildings limits the use of such historic buildings by allowing flexibility and adaptive reuse the board of commissioners believes that historic buildings can be put to profitable use and thereby be maintained and preserved for future generations such adaptive reuse however must be carefully monitored in order to insure there will be no adverse effect upon the neighborhood 2 authorization for adaptive reuse within all business districts and industrial districts an historic building shown on the official historic resources map and

protection the purpose of this article is to assist in permanently protecting this vital natural resource farmlands and prime agricultural soils in accordance with c22 6054 and 6191 of the municipalities planning a transferable development rights program is established in the township and the township designates the agricultural district as the sending area and all other residential and nonresidential districts located within the designated growth area including properties developed under planned residential development regulations as the receiving areas the purpose of the transfer of development rights program is to preserve the prime agricultural soils and agricultural character of the lands in the agricultural district by shifting development from that area to the receiving areas of the township concept 1 the transfer of development rights is a voluntary agreement under the terms of this ordinance between a willing buyer and a willing seller the rights shall be transferred to a person corporation partnership or other legal entity or the township the development rights may be held by the purchaser for future use or sale or may be immediately attached to a specific parcel of land within the township the development rights shall be considered a separate estate in land and may be transferred subject to the limitations of this ordinance once the development rights are attached to a specific parcel of land those rights shall run with that specific parcel in perpetuity 2 a purchaser of development rights who attaches those rights to a tract of land in accordance with the procedures set forth in this ordinance is permitted to develop a tract within the receiving area with an increase in density building height building length or lot coverage in accordance with the terms specified in herein the seller of the development rights receives compensation from the sale plus the right to retain the land for agricultural use a deed restriction against future development is placed upon the agricultural land in the designated sending area from which the development rights have been severed the price of the development rights will be determined by the willing buyer and willing seller to facilitate the transfer between willing buyer and willing seller the township maintains a list of available transferable development rights and interested parties 3 the deed restriction will not affect the landowners ability to sell the land after the development rights have been severed although such land cannot be sold for development purposes the deed restriction on the land from which the development rights have been severed shall run in favor of the township or an approved conservation organization 4 the owner of the tract in the sending area from which the development rights are severed or any subsequent purchaser or purchasers of the development rights may hold the development rights or may resell the development rights the only use which may be made of the development rights is the ultimate transfer to a developer with a tract in the receiving 262 area the township shall have no obligation to purchase the development rights which have been severed from a tract in the sending area recognition of transferable development rights 1 the township hereby recognizes the severability and transferability of development rights from certain lands within the township to be transferred and used in accordance with the provisions hereof 2 the township in accordance with the criteria set forth in apportionment of development rights shall determine the eligibility of each tract of land within the agricultural district for allocation of transferable development rights the township has no obligation however to

ordinance of manheim township an ordinance establishing rules regulations and standards governing stormwater management within the township of manheim setting forth the procedures to be followed by the officials of the township in applying and administering these rules regulations and standards and providing penalties for the violation thereof be and hereby ordained and enacted by the commissioners of manheim township lancaster county pennsylvania as follows article i general provisions statutory authority the commissioners of manheim township are empowered to regulate these activities by the authority of the act of  pl 864 act 167 32 ps  6801 et seq as amended the stormwater management act act 394 of 193 as amended 35 ps  6911 et seq the pennsylvania clean streams law 53 ps  55101 et seq and the first class township township is also empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the act of  pl 805 no 247 the pennsylvania municipalities planning code mpc as amended title this ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the stormwater management manheim township statement of findings the commissioners of manheim township find that 1 inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities contributes to erosion and sedimentation overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities reduces groundwater recharge threatens public health and safety and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources 12 2 a comprehensive program of stormwater management including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff is fundamental to the public health safety welfare and the protection of the people of the township and all the people of the commonwealth their resources and the environment 3 stormwater is an important water resource which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams which also protects and maintains surface water quality 4 the township is required by federal and state regulations to implement a program of stormwater controls the township is required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges for their municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes 5 riparian buffers and riparian forest buffers enhance water quality by filtering pollutants in runoff providing light control and temperature moderation processing pollutants increasing infiltration and providing channel and shoreline

generation of a mixeduse development was proposed due to internalization documentation should be provided 11 estimates of trip distribution required a trip distribution can be estimated using any one of the following three methods i analogy ii trip distribution model 513 iii surrogate data b whichever method is used trip distribution must be estimated and analyzed for the horizon year a multiuse development may require more than one distribution and coinciding assignment for each phase for example residential and retail phases on the same site consideration must also be given to whether site generated inbound and outbound trips will have similar distributions 12 trip assignments assignments must be made considering logical routings available roadway capacities left turns at intersections and projected and perceived minimum travel times  in addition multiple paths should often be assigned between origins and destinations to achieve realistic estimates rather than assigning all of the trips to the route with the shortest travel time the assignments must be carried external site access points and in large projects those producing two hundred 200 or more additional peak direction trips to or from the site during the developments peak hour internal roadways when the site has more than one access drive logical routing and possibly multiple paths should be used to obtain realistic driveway volumes the assignment should reflect conditions at the time of the analysis assignments can be accomplished either manually or with applicable computer models if a thorough analysis is required to account for passby trips the following procedure should be used a determine the percentage of passby trips in the total trips generated b estimate a trip distribution for the passby trips c perform two separate trip assignments based on the new and passby trip distributions d combine the passby and new trip assignment 13 total traffic impacts a traffic estimates for any site with current traffic activity must reflect not only new traffic associated with the sites redevelopment but also the trips subtracted from the traffic stream because of the removal of a land use the traffic impact report should clearly depict the total traffic estimate and its components 514 b the study area roadway network is to be analyzed for safety and capacity sufficiency for three separate conditions 1 existing network conditions 2 future network conditions without the proposed development and 3 future network conditions with the proposed development for each of the three conditions the following analyses shall be completed i mainline adt volumes and turning movement volumes for all critical intersections within the study area will be determined for the am peak hour pm peak hour and the proposed development peak hour if other than either the am or pm peak hour of the network ii the effectiveness of the traffic signal control at all intersections will be evaluated by approach in terms of vehicle stops and delays iii gap studies will be conducted in accordance with standards established by the ite at the proposed site access points to evaluate the need for signal control turn prohibitions or additional site access points to reduce the left turn volume from the site driveways if unsatisfactory levels of service are achieved iv queue length studies will be completed in accordance with standards established by the ite to evaluate the potential for a backup of traffic from controlled intersections which could impact other intersections including access points to the proposed development c the analysis of the existing roadway and intersection conditions in the study area will be based upon the current geometric conditions and traffic control operations this analysis will serve as a basis for determining the current adequacy of the roadway network and to document any deficiencies d the analysis of the future conditions without the proposed development will document the adequacy of the study area network to accommodate traffic in the horizon years without the proposed development e the analysis of the future conditions with the proposed development will document the adequacy of the study area network to accommodate traffic in the horizon years with the proposed development 515 14 required levels of service the recommendations of the traffic impact study shall provide safe and efficient movement of traffic to and from and within and past the proposed development while minimizing the impact to nonsite trips the current levels of service must be maintained if they are c or d they should not deteriorate to worse than c if they are currently a or b and shall be improved to a d if they are e or f in addition there shall be no increase in delay if an unsatisfactory level of service cannot be attained 15 capacity analysis a capacity analysis must be performed at each of the street and project site access intersection locations signalized and unsignalized within the study area in addition analyses must be completed for roadway segments effected by the proposed site traffic within the study area these may include such segments as weaving sections ramps internal site roadways parking facility access points and reservoirs for vehicles queuing off site and on site other locations may be deemed appropriate depending on the situation b the recommended levelofservice shall be computed in accordance with 1994 highway capacity manual special report 209 published by the transportation research board or any subsequent revision of such manual the most current version of the highway capacity software can be used c the operational analyses in the highway capacity manual should be used for analyzing existing conditions traffic impacts access requirements or other future conditions for which traffic geometric and control parameters can be established d in developing the proposed improvements the study prepared is to consider the following i all highway capacity evaluations shall consider not only the overall intersection level of service and delay but also evaluate each approach and movement to identify any substandard values which need to be improved ii for locations where the level of service of the horizon year without the proposed development is f the improvements shall provide an estimated delay which will be no worse than the delay for the horizon year without the proposed development 516 iii where new intersections are being established to serve as access to the proposed development these intersections must be designed to at least operate at level of service c or better iv improvements must be designed to meet the preferred level of service which is defined in township impact fee ordinance for the applicable transportation service area v for access points to the proposed development which are not proposed to be controlled by a traffic signal an analysis

roadway segment is an interval of roadway length terminated at each end by the intersection of another roadway or a cul de sac or dead end curbline or centerline when determining whether to terminate a segment at the curbline of an intersecting roadway or at the centerline of the intersecting roadway one must set a priority of service level on the roadways to be measured this is a process more simple than it sounds when preparing to measure new roadways look at the existing roadways to which the new roads connect it is most likely that some or all of these roads will feed outside traffic to new roads the roadways which feed outside traffic to the new roads or collect traffic from the new roads and feed it to the outside are of a higher service class then the new roads  a segment should terminate at the curbline of a higher class roadway and terminate at the centerline of a lower class roadway  exception where an entire higher class roadway terminates at a lower class roadway t intersection the higher class roadway will terminate at the curbline of the lower class roadway and the segments of the lower class roadway will terminate at the centerline of the higher class roadway
