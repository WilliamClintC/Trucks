district this district is a mixeduse district that is applied to the central business section of englewood the district is designed to create an environment having urban characteristics within a relatively small area of land close proximity of activities and increased social and cultural opportunities the uses within this district are those that provide retailing and personal services to residents of the city and the surrounding area and are compatible with adjacent development in order to make the central business district viable twentyfour 24 hours a day and not just during the

governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry by minimizing flood losses b findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in special flood hazard areas that cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately anchored elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage c purpose it is the purpose of this promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 protect property and minimize damage to critical facilities infrastructure and other public facilities such as water sewer and gas mains  electrical and communications stations  and streets and bridges located in floodplains  3 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  4 protect the natural areas required to convey flood flows so that they develop in a manner consistent with reasonable floodplain management  5 protect and preserve the watercarrying characteristics and capacities of all watercourses including gulches sloughs and artificial water channels used for the conveyance of storm and floodwater  6 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  7 minimize prolonged business interruptions  8 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas to minimize future flood blight areas  and 9 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area d methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  and 5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers including fences and walls which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands    1642  jurisdiction and applicability a applicability the provisions of this apply to all land within the city defined as 1 the special flood hazard areas

living space a desirable outlook from the principal living room exposure natural light and ventilation access to and around the units offstreet parking and spacing between the manufactured home dwellings and between the dwelling unit and other buildings for reducing potential adverse effects of noise odor glare or hazards from fire it is intended in these regulations to relate requirements to performance of these functions allowing maximum flexibility in detailed site planning and use in so long as performance standards are met 2 dwelling unit exposure and outlook for purposes of relating requirements to function yards and other open spaces around the manufactured home dwelling units distances between dwelling units and other buildings shall be determined by exposures and outlooks from the portions of the dwelling units involved exposures of portions of dwelling units and the minimum open space depth are defined and classified as follows class a portions of walls containing principal living room exposure to outdoor living area windows andor glassed doors prime consideration here is direct view of and convenient access to outdoor livable space in cases where two 2 walls of the dwelling unit provide this type of exposure from the living room either may be selected as the class a exposure and the other shall be considered class c class a exposures minimum open space depth for class a exposures shall be fifteen feet 15 the class a exposure shall be to livable space required or other on the lot and not to parking area or driveway area class b portions of walls containing the only windows for bedrooms or principal windows andor glassed doors for bedrooms where privacy moderate outlook light and air are principal considerations class b exposures minimum open space depth for class b exposures shall be ten feet 10 this may include livable open space and parking and driveway areas on the lot class c portions of walls containing secondary windows for bedrooms windows for kitchens bathrooms utility rooms and the like secondary windows for living rooms or exterior doors other than entries with class a orientation where windows involved do not involve privacy or are so located shielded or are of such a nature that necessary privacy is assured and where light air and fire protection are principal considerations class c exposures minimum open space depth for class c exposures shall be eight feet 8 this may include the same types of open space as for b class d portions of walls containing no windows doors or other openings but not so constructed or safeguarded as to be suitable for attachment to other dwelling units or principal buildings principal concern in such cases is with fire protection class d exposures minimum open space depth for class d exposures shall be five feet 5 this may include the same types of open space as for b class e portions of walls containing no windows doors or other openings and so constructed or safeguarded as to provide at least one 1 hour fire protection if it were attached to another manufactured home dwelling unit or to a permitted building class e exposures no minimum open space depth requirements 9 distance to common areas except as provided above distance from any exposure to a street pavement or to the edge of a common driveway a common parking area a common walk or other common area shall be at least eight feet 8 for class a exposure this distance shall be at least fifteen feet 15 carports open in a manner which assures compliance with the provisions of subsection b5 maximum

that as located and constructed such structures do not constitute undesirable impediments to view or fire hazards 11 spacing of manufactured home dwelling units on abutting required distances between manufactured home dwelling units or additions thereto enclosed for more than fifty percent 50% of their perimeters shall be the sum of the required distances for the exposures involved 12 equivalent spacing alternative as an alternative to providing required open space between units or portions of units as the sum of adjoining open spaces on individual lots where equivalent spacing can be assured in a form appropriate to the exposures involved by decreasing clearance from the lot line on one lot and increasing clearance from the lot line on the other this arrangement may be permitted provided that access for servicing and maintenance of units involved can be assured and further provided that minimum open space depth for class a exposures shall be located on the same lot as the unit thus for example in a row of lots on which class a exposures faced class c exposures calling for minimum open space depth of fifteen feet 15 on the lots with class a exposure and eight feet 8 on the lots with class c the units could all be moved to the lot line on the class c exposure side if the minimum depth on the class a exposure side was increased to twentythree feet 23 13 occupancy of

dimensional requirements a rules of measurement 1 residential density a net density net density shall be calculated by dividing the net acreage of a parcel by the minimum lot area required for each dwelling unit net acreage is equal to gross acreage less land area devoted to public rightsofway b gross density gross density shall be calculated by dividing the gross acreage of a parcel by the minimum lot area required for each dwelling unit c rounding when applying a density standard to a parcels land area all resulting fractions shall be rounded down to the next lower whole number d maximum density not guaranteed the number of dwelling units allowed on a site is based on the presumption that all other applicable site development standards shall be met the maximum density established for a zone district in this not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained nor a valid justification for varying other dimensional or development standards 2 lot area lot area is measured as the amount of gross land area contained within a horizontal plane bounded by the front side and rear lot lines but not including streets or rightsofway 3 lot coverage a general rule lot coverage is the percentage of total lot area which when viewed directly from above would be covered by a structure or structures or any part thereof excluding projecting roof eaves it is calculated by dividing the square footage of structure cover by the square footage of the lot unless specifically exempted by subsection b below the term structure includes private walkways driveways and other paved surface areas used or intended for parking vehicles eg parking pads see figure 1661 b exemptions from the calculation of lot coverage 1 driveways or portions thereof twelve feet 12 or less in width  2 private walkways or portions thereof five feet 5 or less in width  3 areas covered by swimming pools hot tubs and ornamental ponds  4 open uncovered decks or patios less than thirty inches 30 above grade  or 5 covered unenclosed porches commentary to figure 1661 lot coverage above the crosshatching shown represents total lot coverage including portions of the lot covered by the principal

coverage front lot coverage is the portion of the front setback or front yard area whichever is larger of a residential lot covered by a an impervious material including but not limited to driveways sidewalks and parking pads andor b any structure or portion thereof permitted to encroach into the front setback area front lot coverage is expressed as a percentage commentary to figure 1662 front lot coverage above the crosshatching shown in this figure illustrates those parts of this homes front setback area that are covered by impervious materials or surfacesin this case the portion of the paved driveway within the front setback area and the front walkway between the sidewalk and the homes front porch the total area covered by those impervious materials or surfaces divided by the entire area of the front setback equals the total front lot coverage 5 lot width lot width refers to the horizontal distance parallel to the front lot line measured between side lot lines at the front setback line or if no setback line is established the distance between the side lot lines measured along the street line 6 setbacks setbacks are measured along a line at right angles from the lot line to a point equivalent to the minimum setback setbacks shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except for the projections specifically allowed in f emc 7 floor area ratio far far is measured as the total floor area on a lot divided by the land area of that lot total floor area includes the total floor areas of the several floors of the structure as measured by the exterior faces of the walls including fully enclosed porches and the like as measured by the exterior limits thereof but excluding a garage space which is in the basement of a building or in the case of garage space

mechanical equipment customarily located in the basement or cellar such as heating and air conditioning equipment plumbing and electrical equipment 8 building or structure height building or structure height is the vertical distance of a building or structure as measured from the average elevation of the finished grade at the corners of the building or structure base to the highest point of the building or structure when referring to a tower or other similar structure height is measured from the average ground level to the highest point on the tower or other structure even if said highest point is an antenna 9 street frontage street frontage is the horizontal distance between side lot lines along the front lot line abutting the street on corner lots street frontage is measured along

in emc 6 residential garage placement and design a intent locating the garage to the rear or side of the home as is typical in many parts of the citys residential districts allows the architectural details of the home and front yard to define the character of the street recent residential development has introduced designs where garages and often driveways dominate the public street to protect the established character in many residential neighborhoods garage placement and scale should be carefully considered to minimize visual impacts upon the street and surrounding development b garage placement and designgarages on front building facade 1 applicability this subsection shall apply to garages that are attached to the front facade of the principal dwelling structure 2 maximum length of garage door as percentage of total facade length streetfacing garage doors shall not comprise more than the following percentage of the total length of the front facade of the principal dwelling structure lot width maximum total cumulative width of street facing garage doors as % of front building facade length less than or equal to 50 feet 40% more than 50 feet 45% for purposes of this provision the width of the streetfacing garage doors shall be measured as the linear distance between the outer edges of the doors including any support or wall area between two 2 or more garage doors that is less than three feet 3 wide where two 2 or more streetfacing garage doors are located on the front facade of the building but are separated by more than three feet 3 of support or wall area the width of each garage door not including the separating wall area shall be added together to determine the numerator for this formula commentary to figure 16612 above this figure illustrates an acceptable attached garage design for the front facade of a oneunit dwelling wherein the width of the garage door measured edge to edge does not exceed forty percent 40% or fortyfive percent 45% of the entire length of the buildings front facade 3 design standards for sideloaded garages sideloaded garages shall have architectural details or windows on the sidewall of the garage facing the street that are consistent with the features of the living portion of the dwelling commentary to figure 16613 above this figure illustrates an acceptable design and level of detail for the streetfacing side wall of an attached sideloaded garage 4 guidelines for garages on corner is strongly encouraged that oneunit dwellings on corner lots be built with garages either attached or detached that are accessed from the alley or the longer side lot line 7 articulation of streetfacing building facades a intent this subsections standards are intended to provide variety and visual interest in the exterior design and massing of residential buildings and to respect prevalent neighborhood design patterns that generally provide a rich variety of approaches to articulating building planes tall boxy forms should be avoided as should long expanses of blank wall visible from public ways b applicability this subsections articulation standards shall apply to all dwelling types subject to these residential standards and specifically only to such dwellings elevations that face a public street but not including elevations that face only a public alley c articulation of wall surface required all building elevations that face a public street shall employ varied articulation of wall surfaces when such surfaces exceed twentyfive feet 25 in length including any attached garages for every twentyfive 25 linear feet wall surfaces shall be articulated of three 3 or more of the following techniques 1 a change in texture or material provided all exterior wall textures and material are consistent with the overall architectural style of the dwelling  2 use of offsets reveals insets bays or other similar architectural features  3 use of balconies overhangs or covered patios  4 variations in rooflines such as a gable or dormer  5 window placement provided windows are similar in size shape and orientation as those found on most of the dwellings on the same block  6 use of exterior trim  or 7 incorporation of stoops or front porches related to entrances commentary to figure 16614 above the house to the left in this figure incorporated a level of streetfacing building facade articulation that complies with the standard of b7c while the house on the right presents an unacceptable unarticulated facade to the street that does not comply with the standard commentary to figure 16615 above this figure illustrates how a house design that at first does not comply with the streetfacing facade articulation standard in b7c above can be redesigned to comply with the standard without significantly changing the basic layout size or massing of the house c special building and site design standards applicable in the mur3 zone districts 1 new highdensity residential and office projects should be sensitive to the character of adjacent development the siting of vertical structures should respect the topographic features of the land 2 highdensity residential and office development should be located on land parcels of sufficient size to ensure proper site design and identity and to warrant the installation of desirable amenities 3 where possible the view of the mountains should be preserved and buildings oriented in such a way as to maximize the occupant views of the mountains d reserved e design standards and guidelines for large retail buildings 1 purpose this intended to set standards for retail development with communitywide or regional impacts to ensure that the proposed development fits with the expectations and needs of the community and to encourage retail development that contributes to englewood as a unique place by reflecting and adding appropriately to its physical character these standards and guidelines require a basic level of
