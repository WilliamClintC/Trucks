variance is for floodplain management purposes only insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance the variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners the characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate eff  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of onehalf 12 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles 4 and 5 of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf 12 acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the

goals of the community vision elaborated in the avalon 2020 vision as adopted by resolution of the city council on  the avalon 2020 vision was drafted by a working group of avalon citizens after numerous community meetings focus groups and surveys and embodies the statement of policy pursuant to which the comprehensive longterm plans for the development of avalon shall be formulated and measured with regard to housing the avalon 2020 vision states as a goal that residents have access to dignified affordable housing b encourage the availability of dignified safe and affordable workforce housing within the city of avalon by promoting development of decent living environments and removing unnecessary barriers to such development in order to increase the opportunities for dignified safe and affordable housing for lower moderate and middleincome households as well as households with special needs and to thereby implement the housing policies articulated in the housing element of the general plan c assist in the development of affordable home ownership opportunities for lower moderate and middleincome residents 9 eff  editors note prior ordinance history includes portions of  840 1018 and 106107 findings the city of avalon finds that a both california and the city face a serious housing problem that threatens their economic security lack of access to workforce housing has a direct impact on the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city the city will not be able to contribute to the attainment of state housing goals or to retain a healthy environment without additional affordable housing the house problem has an impact upon a broad range of income groups including many who are not impoverished by standards other than those found in californias and the citys housing markets and no single housing program will be sufficient to meet the housing need b without assistance from government there exists within the city a shortage of workforce housing that is affordable either for rental or purchase to persons of lower moderate and middle income while federal and state money and programs continue to assist in meeting the housing needs of lower and moderateincome groups middleincome housing is not eligible for this money or programs c strong demand for second vacation homes has helped push the purchase price of a home in the city beyond the reach of much of the local workforce including middleincome households d home ownership helps foster a stable middle income population that strengthens and benefits the community economically and socially rapid rises in real property and development costs have eliminated affordable housing for the middle class in the city teachers firefighters managers medical professionals and others considered as middle class can no longer afford to purchase a modest home the percentage of local residents who own their homes has declined in the past twenty 20 years from thirtythree 33% percent to twentyfive 25% percent e there is a need to develop housing removed from the speculative real estate market by imposing various restrictions designed to ensure that it is owned and lived in by local workers and remains in the affordable housing pool when sold f development of new commercial projects and marketrate housing encourages new residents to move to the city these residents together with other commercial projects will place demands on services provided by both the public and private sectors some of the public and private sector employees needed to meet the needs of the new residents or commercial developments earn incomes only adequate to pay for affordable housing because affordable housing is in short supply within the city these employees may be forced to live in less than adequate housing within the city or pay a disproportionate share of their incomes to live in adequate housing these circumstances harm the citys ability to attain goals articulated in the citys general plan and strain the citys ability to accept and service new marketrate housing development or commercial projects g if new development is solely created for higher income second home ownership it will exacerbate the work force housing shortage and reduce the limited supply of water and developable land that is available for affordable workforce housing within the city h the requirement to provide affordable housing in new projects will serve and important public purpose and help mitigate the impacts of such development on the affordable housing shortage inclusionary housing policies continue to a healthy job and housing balance i the citizens of the city seek a wellplanned aesthetically pleasing and balanced community with housing affordable to lower moderate and middleincome households workforce housing should be available city and not restricted to a few neighborhoods and areas however there may also be tradeoffs where constructing affordable units at a different site than the site of the principal projects may produce a greater number of affordable units without additional costs to the project applicant thus the city finds that in certain limited circumstances the purpose of this chapter may be better served by allowing the developer to comply with the inclusionary requirement means such as the payment of inlieu fees development of offsite housing or dedication of land for example if a project applicant can produce a significantly greater number of affordable units off site then it may but not always be in the best interest of the city to permit the development of affordable units as a different location than that of the principal project as further set forth in this j the city is aware that there may be times when the inclusionary housing requirements make marketrate housing more expensive in weighing all the factors including the significant need for affordable housing the city has made the decision that the communitys interests are best served by the adoption of this inclusionary housing ordinance 9 eff  definitions please note these definitions contain additional provisions and requirements of the inclusionary
