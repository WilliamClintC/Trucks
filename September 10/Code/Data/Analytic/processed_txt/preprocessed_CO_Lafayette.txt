and is more concerned with a users water allotment and reducing overwatering this form can help any user create a target annual water budget from which to work the information below will help guide you annual water budget worksheet on the following page step 1 gallons of water needed by plant category different plants have different water needs a plant list that identifies the water needs of landscape plants high moderate low very low is available in the planning and building department due to variability in plant water requirements due to location of the plant on a site a range of hydrozone categories has been shown for many plants for purposes of calculating the water budget for each hydrozone the lowest hydrozone category for each plant shall be used step 2 irrigation areas zones based on plant water need category both automatic irrigation systems and handplaced yard sprinklers deliver water to plants by watering areas or zones and have set watering amounts determined by you the user if you have high water need plants within low or very low water plant groupings the entire area must be considered a highwater area and irrigated as such  however some plants may be overwatered if this occurs the area of each watering zone can be determined by physically measuring the zone and multiplying length in feet by width in feet the resulting areas in square feet or sf can be entered in step 3 below step 3 wateruse calculations fill in the blanks with area and water need per zone for example you might have an area of 300 sf in a high water zone that would require 20 gallons of water per sf after multiplying you would find that area requires 6000 gallons of water per season after calculating the irrigation needs of all areas determine your average overall water needs per season to do this add the total gallons needed for all zones and divide by the total square footage for all zones the average for the overall site must be no more than 15 gallons per sf per season if your average is more than this you must modify your planting layout to create more lowvery low water zones that would balance your highmoderate water zones and reduce overwatering annual

interpretation of this section including the preparation of maps and standards showing the size and arrangement of typical offstreet parking locations  2486   92011   2192019 sign regulations legislative intent a the purpose of these regulations is to protect the health safety and welfare of the residents of the city by regulating the design construction and installation of signs in the city the council recognizes that signs are a necessary means of visual communication for the public convenience and that businesses services and other activities have the right to identify themselves by using signs that are accessory and incidental to the use of the premises where the signs are located in these regulations the city council intends to provide a reasonable balance between the right of an individual to identify its business and the right of the public to be protected against the visual discord that results from the unrestricted proliferation of signs the city council also intends by these regulations to ensure that signs are compatible with adjacent land uses and with the total visual environment of the community another purpose of these regulations is to protect the public from hazardous conditions by prohibiting signs that 1 are structurally unsafe  2 obscure or distract the vision of motorists  or 3 compete or conflict with necessary traffic signs and warning signals in adopting these regulations the council recognizes that the size of signs that provide adequate identification in pedestrianoriented areas differs from that necessary in vehicularoriented areas where traffic is heavy travel speeds are greater and required setbacks are greater b the council also recognizes in adopting these regulations that instances may occur where strict application of its provisions may deprive a person of the reasonable use of a sign and that such person should have a procedure to obtain variances from the requirements of these regulations for good cause c reserved d the city council finds that certain types of devices that might be considered to be signs are not appropriate for any regulation because they 1 would not create a structural safety or traffic safety hazard  2 would promote public safety or the dissemination of public information  or 3 do not impede aesthetic concerns e the city council further finds that certain other signs of a small size do not create traffic safety hazards or aesthetic disruption so as to require a permit and inspection pursuant to these regulations but must comply with structural and setback requirements of this section with respect to real estate signs the council finds that a small for sale or for rent sign is a viable means of advertising real estate and does not create a traffic hazard  2486   11215 application

construction costs higher causing a rise in the price of housing and causing the supply of housing that is affordable to moderate income households to be located in limited areas if at all  c increases in income have not kept pace with the rapid and significant increases in the cost of housing in lafayette  d housing problems have escalated due to population increase a limited supply of developable land and as a result of the lack of residential building permits available due to the adoption of lafayette charter section 610  e developers of new housing are not meeting the need for housing to serve households earning lower income levels  f the lack of an adequate supply of housing that is affordable to a significant percentage of the wage earners employed in jobs within lafayette will make it difficult for those individuals to find housing within lafayette and negatively impacts employers within lafayette due to the resulting impacts on employee productivity labor costs and the availability of a labor force  g a lack of dwelling units that are affordable to lower income households threatens to negatively impact the prospects for economic development within lafayette which economic development is necessary to sustain and improve upon the level of municipal services provided by lafayette to its citizens  h without a program encouraging the construction of

finds that demand for construction of new dwelling units may in the short term exceed 1 the ability of the city to deliver and treat additional water  2 the ability of the city to treat sewage safely within acceptable federal and state standards  3 the ability of the city to acquire and store sufficient additional raw water resources to meet all seasonal water needs of the existing community when added to increased demands from additional dwelling units the city council further finds from a review of the comprehensive plan and long range planning studies and budget documents of the city and from a review of the citys capital programs and its plans to expand the citys existing water treatment and wastewater treatment plants that sound management of the citys fiscal condition and management of the citys future growth mandate a plan for growth management the city council further finds that it has enacted certain review criteria pertaining to all residential planned unit developments codified in section 26185 of this that proper application of said criteria may require management of the citys future growth the city council further finds that the adoption of of the colorado constitution mandates a steady and substantially uniform growth from year to year in order to protect the citys ability to provide municipal services to its existing and future citizens on  the citys electors adopted an amendment to the citys charter finding that it is the will of the people of lafayette to maintain the economic social and environmental advantages of having a small town character  that it is the will of the people of lafayette to prevent actions that will increase city operating and capital construction expenses that would necessitate a tax increase or increases for these purposes  and determining that a cap of two hundred 200 dwelling units per year allowing for approximately three 3 percent annual growth in the existing population of lafayette is an appropriate level of growth to preserve and maintain the economic social and environmental advantages of having a small town character and preserving the quality of services provided by the city to its citizens and the quality of life enjoyed by those citizens the city council of the city of lafayette hereby adopts these findings by the citys electors the city council further finds that on  the citys electors adopted an amendment to the charter stating that i the approximately twelveacre parcel located in the se quarter of township 1 north range 69 west north of the intersection of brooks avenue and dounce street shall be exempt from the limitations of section 610 of the charter so long as it is developed for residential purposes by the boulder county housing authority or its agent and ii that dwelling units located within mixed use building complexes within the urban renewal area  lafayette old town as that area existed as of  shall also be exempt from the limitations of section 610 of the charter the city council further finds that on  the citys electors adopted an amendment to the charter stating that i in addition to the other dwelling units authorized by section 610 of the charter the city council may authorize the construction of up to fifty 50 permanently affordable dwelling units per year and ii permanently affordable dwelling unit shall mean a dwelling unit that is deed restricted for perpetuity to permit persons whose household income is less than or equal to eighty 80 percent of the thencurrent boulder county area median income as may be adjusted from time to time to qualify to purchase or rent the dwelling unit and iii unissued building permits for permanently affordable dwelling units may not be carried forward from year to year but the council may approve the issuance of building permits for more than fifty 50 permanently affordable dwelling units in a single calendar year if the number of building permits for permanently affordable dwelling units approved in the following year is reduced by an equal amount the city council further finds that on  the citys electors adopted an amendment to the charter stating that the total number of new dwelling units between  and  shall not exceed one thousand two hundred 1200 and that city council shall adopt an ordinance setting out criteria it will utilize in determining the annual number of new dwelling units that are allowed to be built in any such year which will address allocation of permits for new dwelling units over the entire sixyear period in addition this charter amendment stated that those developments within the city for which city council prior to  had determined and assigned by resolution a priority classification and building permit allocation pursuant to the citys residential growth management program that was in place prior to  shall be exempt from the above limitation and may receive such building permits without regard to the calendar year for which their permits were allocated but only to the extent that such properties are developed substantially in compliance with the approved preliminary plan upon which their allocations are based and that those properties within the city that prior to  were eligible to be in the category of otherwise entitled to priority pursuant to the citys residential growth management program by reason of commitments made by the city that existed prior to  with respect to annexation shall be exempt from the above limitation the city council further finds that section 610 of the charter is not selfexecuting and it is therefore necessary to adopt by ordinance certain policies and procedures as set forth in this article to implement the charter requirements and to administer the issuance of residential building permits in accordance with the charters requirements based on its review and its knowledge of future growth plans of the city the city budget and capital programs various comprehensive plan and long range planning studies reports from its water engineers and attorneys and in consideration of the review criteria applicable to residential puds and in order to comply with the requirements of section 610 of the charter the city council of the city of lafayette finds that it is essential to the public health safety and welfare of all the residents and property owners within the city both present and future and it is further essential in order to maintain and promote orderly and planned growth that a reasonable balance be maintained between the construction of additional buildings creating new demands on city services and facilities and the ability of the city to expand its services and facilities in order to achieve such a balance the city council finds that the issuance of building
