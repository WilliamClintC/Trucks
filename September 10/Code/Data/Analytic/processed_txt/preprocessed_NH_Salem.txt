been estimated based on design and economic analyses the increase in demand for water supply and demand on the capacity of the existing sewer system has also been estimated the cost of providing a unit of capacity of water supply or a unit of capacity of wastewater disposal has been determined from those capacity and cost estimates the unit capital cost of water supply treatment capacity and distribution has been determined as a dollar value per gallon per day of water delivery capacity the unit capital cost for wastewater collection and transmission facilities has been determined as a dollar value per gallon per day of demand based on these values the following is the allocation of costs as expressed by the document titled town of salem nh townwide sewer and water buildout estimated costs and demand flows a fifty percent of the capital cost for water and sewer service will be assessed to those who are newly served by the water  4553 salem code  4554   4555 charges and sewer system and to those who increase their demand on the system based on the unit cost for providing water supply and wastewater disposal capacity to meet the increased demand each user of new or increased capacity will be assessed a charge based on the demand required by that user as expressed by the document titled flow demand and benefit values and the unit capital cost to provide that capacity or meet that demand b fifty percent of the capital cost for providing new or increased water or sewer service will be paid by water and sewer rate revenues that are based on the amount of water withdrawn from or wastewater discharged to the system by all of the customers connected to the system 2 recognizing that it is not possible to exactly balance the capital cost expenditure and assessment revenue at all times the capital costs and debt service not paid by the assessments will be paid from water and sewer rate revenues it is intended and expected that over the duration of the
