interceptor sewers under project number c180611 is approximately $4040000 bthe consulting engineers estimate that an equitable distribution on a percentage basis of the total cost of construction and equipment included in the treatment plant project would be as follows treatment of sanitary waste flow49% treatment of suspended solids25% treatment of bod26% cthe design capacity of the treatment plant is as follows 1flow annual design flow capacity of 1168 mg 2suspended solids design capacity 240 mg1 times annual flow capacity 1168 mg times weight will result in 2335907 pounds average annual design capacity 3biochemical oxygen demand design capacity 204 mgl times annual flow capacity 1168 mg times weight will result in 1985521 pounds average annual design capacity dindustrial cost recovery period will be 30 years eaverage annual basis for the cost recovery charge will amount to $134667 $4040000 federal grant divided by 30years recovery period for treatment fthe annual basis for the cost recovery charge allocated to treatment functions is as follows treatment of waste volume  $134667 x 49%   $65987 treatment of suspended solids  $134667 x 25%   $33667 treatment of bod  $134667 x 26%   $35013 gthe industrial cost recovery rates for the treatment charges are computed on the basis of the annual functional costs of treatment divided by average annual design capacity in the following manner 1treatment of waste volume annual functional cost of $65987 divided by annual capacity of 1168 mg equals $0565 per 1000 gallons 2treatment of suspended solids annual functional cost of $33667 divided by annual capacity of 2335 907 pounds equals $015 per pound 3treatment of biochemical oxygen demand annual functional cost of $35013 divided by annual capacity of 1985521 pounds equals $018 per pound hthe rates computed in g above would result in total recovery of the federal grant amount if all users were subject to the industrial cost recovery requirements and provided that the treatment plant was used to capacity during the cost recovery period therefore these rates will ensure that each industrial user will pay only that portion of the federal grant amount applicable

required for all new business commercial and industrial developments residential subdivisions planned development rural estate subdivisions and any redevelopment or other new construction located within the city the city after thorough investigation and evaluation may waive the requirement of controlled runoff for minor subdivisions and parcelization bpolicy on stormwater quantity management 1detention policy it is recognized that most streams and drainage channels serving the city do not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization accordingly the storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff shall be required for all developments and redevelopments as defined in  5464 located within the city ageneral release rates 1in general the post development release rates for developments up to and including the tenyear return period storm may not exceed 01 cfs per acre of development the postdevelopment release rate for developments for the 11  100year return period storms shall not exceed 03 cfs per acre of development the above fixed general release rates may be set at a lower value by the city for certain watersheds if more detailed data becomes available as a result of comprehensive watershed studies conducted or formally approved and adopted by the city council the applicant shall confirm the applicable release rates with the city prior to initiating the design calculations to determine whether a basinspecific rate has been established for the watershed 2the release rate for pre developed areas that have more than one outlet must be computed based on predeveloped drainage area tributary to each outlet point the computed release rate at each outlet point shall not be exceeded at the respective outlet point even if the postdeveloped conditions would involve a different arrangement of outlet points also if an outlet control structure includes an orifice to restrict the flow rate such orifice shall be no less than four inches in diameter even if the fourinch diameter orifice results in a discharge that exceeds the abovenoted general release rates bsitespecific release rates for sites with depressional storage 1for sites where depressional storage exists the general release rates provided above may have to be further reduced if depressional storage exists at the site sitespecific release rates must be calculated according to methodology described in the city of greenfield stormwater technical standards manual accounting for the depressional storage by modeling it as a pond whose outlet is a weir at an elevation that stormwater can currently overflow the depressional storage area post developed release rate for sites with depressional storage shall be the twoyear predeveloped peak runoff rate for the postdeveloped tenyear storm and tenyear predeveloped peak runoff rate for the post developed 100year storm in no case shall the calculated sitespecific release rates be larger than general release rates provided above 2also note that for determining the postdeveloped peak runoff rate the depressional storage must be assumed to be filled unless the city can be assured easement that the noted storage will be preserved in perpetuity cmanagement of offsite runoff 1runoff from all upstream tributary areas offsite land areas may be bypassed around the detentionretention facility without attenuation such runoff may also be bypassed detentionretention facility without attenuation provided that a separate secondary outlet system is incorporated for the safe passage of such flows ie not primary outlet of a detention facility unless the pond is being designed as a regional detention facility and therefore all offsite runoff to the pond detained the primary outlet structure shall be sized and the invert elevation of the secondary outlet for bypassing offsite runoff determined according to the onsite runoff only to accomplish this the 100year onsite runoff must be determined by temporarily ignoring the offsite runoff and routed pond and primary outlet pipe the resulting pond elevation would be the invert elevation of the secondary outlet once the size and location of primary outlet structure and the invert elevation of the secondary outlet for bypassing offsite runoff are determined by considering onsite runoff only the size of the secondary outlet and the 100year pond elevation is determined by routing the entire inflow onsite and offsite pond once the 100year pond elevation is determined in this manner the crest elevation of the open emergency weir is set at that elevation 2note that the efficiency of the detentionretention facility in controlling the onsite runoff may be severely affected if the offsite area is considerably larger than the onsite area as a general guidance online detention may not be effective in controlling onsite runoff where the ratio of offsite area to onsite area is larger than  additional detention above and beyond that required for onsite area may be required by the city when the ratio of offsite area to onsite area is larger than  ddownstream restrictions 1in the event the downstream receiving channel or storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate the postdeveloped release rate provided above then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system additional detention as determined by the city shall be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving storm sewers or watercourses when such downstream restrictions are suspected the city may require additional analysis to determine the receiving systems limiting downstream capacity 2if the proposed development makes up only a portion of the undeveloped watershed upstream of the limiting restriction the allowable release rate for the development shall be in direct proportion to the ratio of its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed upstream of the restriction cgrading and building pad elevations 1maximum yard slopes are  where soil has been disturbed during

considered to be above and beyond the minimum requirements provided in the applicable flood hazard areas ordinance currently in effect in the city the city may alter the compensation ratio based on extenuating circumstances for a specific project 3note that by definition compensatory storage is the replacement of the existing floodplain and in rare exceptions the floodway storage lost due to fill compensatory storage is required when a portion of the floodplain is filled occupied by a structure or when as a result of a project a change in the channel hydraulics occurs that reduces the

relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare bthese flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3statement of purpose it is the purpose of this district to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to arestrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities brequire that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction ccontrol the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters dcontrol filling grading dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage eprevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands fmake federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of the national flood insurance program 4objectives the objectives of this district are ato protect human life and health bto minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects cto minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public dto minimize prolonged business interruptions eto minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains fto help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas bdefinitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the
