ordinance division 1  statutory authorization findings of fact purpose and methods statutory authorization the legislature of the state of louisiana has in statute lrs  delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses therefore the city of bastrop of morehouse parish louisiana does ordain as follows art 1  a 62816 findings of fact 1 the flood hazard areas of the city of bastrop are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage art 1  b 62816 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in floodplains  6 help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas  and 7 insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area art 1  c 62816 methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this ordinance uses the following methods 1 restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters  4 control filling grading dredging and other development which may increase flood damage  5 prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands art 1  d 62816 secs 63306339  reserved division 2  definitions definitions unless specifically defined below words or phrases used in this

justice center for prostitution resources minneapolis minnesota and from sexually oriented businesses an insiders view by david sherman presented to the michigan house committee on ethics and constitutional law jan 12 200 and the report of the attorney generals working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses  state of minnesota the council finds 1 sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the unlicensed operators of the establishments further there is presently no mechanism in this city to make the owners and operators of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises 2 some employees of unregulated sexually oriented businesses defined in this article as adult theaters and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments 3 sexual acts including masturbation and oral and anal sex occur at unregulated sexually oriented businesses especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films videos or live sex shows 4 offering and providing such unregulated space encourages such activities which creates unhealthy conditions 5 some persons frequent certain adult theaters adult arcades and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses or for the purpose of purchasing or selling illicit drugs 6 numerous communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including but not limited to syphilis gonorrhea human immunodeficiency virus infection hivaids genital herpes hepatitis salmonella campylobacter and shigella infections chlamydial myoplasmal and ureoplasmal infections trichomoniasis and chancroid 7 according to research from the kaiser family foundation an estimated six hundred fifty thousand 650000 to nine hundred thousand 900000 americans are infected with hiv the number of new hiv infections occurring each year is now about fortyone thousand 41000 men and women of all races are most likely to be infected by sexual contact 8 reserved 9 the centers for disease control and prevention estimate that as many as one in three 3 people with hivaids do not know they are infected 10 the number of cases of early less than one year syphilis in the united states reported annually has risen with thirtythree thousand six hundred thirteen 33613 cases reported in 1982 and fortyfive thousand two hundred 45200 of 1990 11 the number of cases of gonorrhea in the united states reported annually remains at a high level with over onehalf million cases being reported in 1990 12 the surgeon general of the united states in his report of  has advised the american public that aids and hiv infection may be transmitted contact intravenous drug abuse exposure to infected blood and blood components and from an infected mother to her newborn 13 according to the best scientific evidence aids and hiv infection as well as syphilis and gonorrhea are principally transmitted by sexual acts see eg findings of us dept of health and human services 14 sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy in part because the activities conducted there are unhealthy and in part because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to selfregulate those activities and maintain those facilities 15 numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films 16 the findings noted in paragraphs number 1 15 raise substantial governmental concerns 17 sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns 18 a reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses further such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city it is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein 19 removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters 20 requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments 21 the disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the daytoday operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and will prevent the further secondary effects of dissemination of illegal obscenity child pornography and to minors materials harmful to them  22 it is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity 23 the fact that an applicant for an adult use has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article 24 the barring of such individuals from employment in sexually oriented businesses for a specified period of years serves to prevent distribution of illegal material to prevent conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and to preclude the establishment of criminal enterprises within the city 25 the general welfare health morals and safety of the citizens of the city

prominent front and back yards  zoning districts the suburban context allows for a wide variety of residential commercial and special purpose districts at suburban intensities  building type and dimensions residential buildings are between one and two stories in height residences typically have landscaped front setbacks and building coverage of the lot is relatively low commercial structures are also between one and two stories in height commercial buildings may be built to the street or setback deep enough to allow for a mix of landscaping and parking  block paerns block shapes and sizes vary signicantly within this context often unrelated to form or use the typical block pattern includes attached sidewalks street and surface parking and generous landscaping between the street and building faces residential access is typically a direct connection to a street facing garage or carport commercial access is typically a shared drive to a surface parking lot alleys are atypical but are encouraged in new development  parking parking is provided onstreet and on surface lots limited surface parking is permitted between the building and the street but parking is primarily located to the side and rear of buildings sec 32 zoning districts  suburban residenoal singlefamily srs15 10 6 zoning districts the following zoning districts are established to carry out the provisions of this

accommodate existing or proposed development where the landuse pattern is a mix of singlefamily twofamily and multifamily housing the srm2 district is not intended to provide for large areas exclusively dominated by multifamily but provide for neighborhoods that successfully integrate singlefamily twofamily and multifamily together the srm2 district allows buildings up to two stories in height  suburban commercial corridor scc2 the suburban commercial corridor district is intended to balance the need for safe active and pedestrianscaled diverse areas with the need for limited parking between buildings and the street while the scc2 district allows buildings to be built to the street edge the district addresses development opportunities along autodominated corridors where it is infeasible or impractical to require buildings to be built to the street edge the scc2 district is intended to be located within convenient traveling distance from the multiple neighborhoods they are

provides exibility in development in exchange for a more desirable use of the land a more coherent and coordinated development and a better physical environment than would be possible under one of the other suburban context base zoning districts planned developments are intended as a tool to allow innovative and imaginative design that will promote amenities beyond those expected in conventional suburban developments and conservation of open space and natural areas planned developments within the suburban context may remain consistent with the established suburban pattern or may be more urban in design allowed uses  general provisions a use categories 1 in order to regulate use categories of uses have been established 2 use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning land uses to
