students are eighteen years of age or older it would be lawful to distribute paraphernalia to some students attending the same school in which the distribution to other students would be prohibited

personal service mail or publication thereafter it shall be the responsibility of all class iv users to obtain a permit prior to connection 2 2008  classes of users the clmsd will classify all users in accordance with the principal activity conducted on the premises where the discharge occurs the purpose of the classification is to facilitate regulation of discharges to clmsd facilities on the basis of each users waste quality quantity and flow the classification will further provide a means of imposing an appropriate level of oversight control and enforcement according to the source of the discharge as set forth in there are two categories of users domestic users and nondomestic users nondomestic users are categorized as class i ii iii or iv all users are subject to the prohibitions set forth in this chapter with such federal and state statutes and regulations as may apply and the specific pollutant limitations as may be promulgated by the clmsd board either by ordinance or resolution domestic users under normal circumstances will not be required to apply for or receive a wastewater discharge permit as defined in this chapter  provided that said domestic user discharges only that wastewater which is consistent with the definition of domestic wastewater set forth herein nondomestic users may be subject to wastewater discharge permit requirements depending on the volume characteristics and origin of their wastewater discharge industrial users may be required to supply such information and data concerning their processes including discharge samples as may be necessary for the clmsd to determine whether such user should be designated as class i ii iii or iv industrial users must if requested provide such other information regarding the nature of the entity its operations storage and use of chemicals and storage and use of hazardous substances as may be reasonably necessary to make such determination as to the classification of said user the clmsd may also require information relating to potential for accidental discharges of hazardous or prohibited substances to a clmsd facility such inquiries may include information regarding the current disposal procedures of the user with regard to chemicals andor substances which are not in the ordinary course of the users operations discharge to a clmsd facility a class i for the purpose of this chapter any user subject to the national categorical pretreatment standards is a categorical industrial user ciu and will be designated a class i user b class ii the clmsd may designate a nondomestic user who is not subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard but may be considered a significant industrial user siu to be a class ii user based on whether the discharge of wastewater is equal to or greater than twentyfive thousand gallons per average work day flow or whether it has in its untreated wastewater pollutants which are in excess of any pretreatment standard including any standard identified in this chapter or local limit set by resolution of the clmsd board or whether it may in the opinion of the clmsd have a significant impact either singularly or in combination with other contributing industries on the clmsds ability to meet the objectives of this chapter in addition the designation of a nondomestic user as a class ii user may be based on the unusual character of the wastewater due to its volume strength composition or its derivation from a hazardous waste or substance or the potential variability in the character of the wastewater or on the potential for increased administrative cost to the clmsd due to the unusual character of the waste any additional administrative costs to be considered may include increased potential for the administrative oversight by federal state and local agencies as well as the potential for increased liability exposure and associated legal costs the clmsd may also take into consideration difficulties in enforcement of this chapter under a wastewater discharge permit and the enforcement violation and compliance history of the user with the clmsd as well as other regulatory agencies c class iii the clmsd may designate any nondomestic user who is not designated as a class i or class ii user as a class iii user class iii users may include nondomestic users who are not industrial nor commercial users and 1 have a reasonable potential to adversely affect the clmsds ability to meet the objectives of this chapter  or 2 generate hazardous waste whether or not said waste is discharged into the sanitary sewer system or if in the determination of the clmsd there is a potential for this waste to be discharged into the sewer even in nonprocess or process of handling of the waste  or 3 store or use hazardous materials whether or not a hazardous waste is produced in an industrial or commercial process if in the determination of the clmsd a potential exists for significant impact upon clmsd facilities due to a release of these materials into the environment class iii users may be individually designated by the clmsd based on the criteria set forth in this subsection or on categorization of the user as a member of a particular business category a class iii user designation may include but is not limited to landfill operations landfill leachate or ground water cleanup sites d class iv any nondomestic user who is not designated as a class i class ii or class iii user may be designated as a class iv user if the user 1 has a reasonable potential to adversely affect the clmsds ability to meet the objectives of this chapter  or 2 generates hazardous waste whether or not said waste is in the normal course of the industrial or commercial process discharged into the sanitary sewer system or if in the determination of the clmsd there is a potential for this waste to be discharged into the sewer even in nonprocess or process of handling of the waste  or 3 stores or uses hazardous materials whether or not a hazardous waste is produced in the industrial or commercial process if in the determination of the clmsd a potential exists for significant impact upon clmsd facilities due

connected to public sewers and serving residential multifamily residential commercial or industrial use properties upon the occurrence of stipulated property events the clmsd assumes that all sewer laterals not meeting the requirements set forth in this section and not subject to the exemptions provided herein allow inflow and infiltration into clmsd facilities 1 in the clmsd the exempted transactions or events requiring the cleaning inspection and testing of a private sewer lateral are a the application for a new connection to the sewer collection system  b the application for a building permit for a remodel of any structure being served by the private sewer lateral where the cost of the cumulative value of applicable improvements over the past five years exceeds fortyfive thousand dollars in 2007 dollars and adjusted every year for inflation  c the application for a building or plumbing permit to install additional toilet facilities on the property served  d the application for a change of use on property served from residential to commercial or from nonrestaurant commercial to restaurant commercial  e any repair or replacement of the main sewer to which the private sewer lateral is connected  f a determination by the director that the cleaning inspection and testing is required for the protection of the public health safety and welfare  or g the user chooses to close and stop payment for an existing sewer account without the transfer of such account to another user 2 the property owner is responsible for the repair or replacement of a privately owned sewer lateral which has been found inspection to exhibit conditions which would permit excessive infiltration to enter the sewer collection system or excessive exfiltration the privately owned sewer is defined as that part of the sewer lateral that is required to be maintained by the property owner in accordance with ordinances adopted by the clmsd and described in building sewerprivate sewer lateral upon completion of the repair or replacement of the private sewer lateral reinspections are to be conducted until the private sewer lateral passes the required testing excessive infiltration or exfiltration is defined as exceeding the allowable amount as specified herein once the private sewer lateral has successfully passed the inspection and testing procedure the director shall execute a sewer lateral certificate of compliance which shall be filed with the director and the building department having jurisdiction and recorded with the county recorder of lake county 3 there are two categories of sewer lateral certification of compliance for the continued service of a lateral based upon materials and performance a a tenyear certificate for existing laterals that do not conform to the current material standards for new laterals as established in the california plumbing by the clmsd and do not exfiltrate at a rate greater than that established in the exfiltration pressure test for existing laterals refer to the provisions specified in specified pressure tests of these standards b a twentyfiveyear certificate for existing existing repaired or existing replaced private sewer laterals that meet the current material and testing standards for new laterals as established in the california plumbing by the clmsd for a twentyfiveyear certificate the private sewer lateral must be watertight an alternative testing and inspection procedure for a tenyear certificate consisting only of a cctv inspection of the private sewer lateral is applicable when the potential for hydrostatic conditions around the private sewer lateral does not exist 4 currently all property served by the clmsd is within the zone designated as having the potential for hydrostatic pressures in the clmsd there are four exemptions to the cleaning inspection and testing requirements set forth in this chapter other than certain transfers of interest in real property and they are a private sewer laterals that have been inspected within the last twentyfive years where the lateral is made of pvc metal or other modern material meeting the california plumbing   b private sewer laterals that have been inspected within the last ten years where the lateral is not made of pvc metal or other modern material meeting the california plumbing   c private sewer laterals that were last installed or replaced within the last twentyfive years where the lateral is made of pvc metal or other modern material meeting the california plumbing   and d any building where the director determines that testing andor repairs have been made in accordance with this chapter within the last five years 5 certificates of compliance will be issued indicating that the private sewer lateral is exempt from the inspection and testing provisions of this chapter if the private sewer lateral meets the exemptions stated above however the certificate of compliance for an exemption expires upon the occurrence of an event requiring the inspection or testing or upon the occurrence of another exempted event g approved repair methods and materials for privately owned sewer laterals 1 materials used in the repair or replacement of existing private sewer laterals which have failed to pass an inspection andor test shall be made of pipe materials fittings couplings and other joining materials which have been

lakeports sanitary sewer collection and treatment system d operate the grease interceptor in a manner so as to maintain said device such that attainment to the grease limit is consistently achieved consistent shall mean any wastewater sample taken from said grease interceptor shall be subject to terms of numerical limit attainment described in if legitimate space constraints as determined by the director exist that prohibit the sewer user from installing a grease interceptor a variance for cause request may be submitted  e understand and agree that the use of biological additives as a grease

been completed 4 nongreaseladen sources shall not be connected to sewer lines upstream of the grease interceptor grease interceptors are intended only for greaseladen sources 5 should an obstruction of a clmsd sewer mains occur that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the clmsd sewer mains the clmsd will take appropriate enforcement actions as stipulated in against the generator or contributor of such grease c facilities to install interceptors 1 all facilities described in subsection b1 of this section shall be required to install grease interceptors within one year of written notification by the director or file a variance for cause request within six months of the same notification  if the variance is not granted by the director the user will have six months from written notification of denial to complete said installation as directed 2 if an overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease from an existing fsf without a grease interceptor the clmsd will require the fsf to install a grease interceptor within one hundred eighty days of written notification any additional fixtures that are added to the existing fsf that discharge greaseladen waste streams shall be plumbed into the interceptor if said fixtures cause the interceptor to exceed its minimum design capability a new interceptor may be required by the director 3 except as provided herein for a period of one year following adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter although installation of grease interceptors will be required to be installed no enforcement actions will be taken under this article for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from grease interceptors if during this oneyear period an obstruction of a clmsd sewer mains occurs that causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in a clmsd sewer mains the clmsd will take appropriate enforcement actions as stipulated in against the generator or contributor of such grease 4 access manholes with a minimum diameter of twentyfour inches shall be provided over each chamber and sanitary tee the access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration the manholes shall also have readily removable lids and inflow and infiltration

removable covers the grease interceptor shall contain a baffle system which adequately diverts and slows the flow to avoid shortcircuiting grease interceptors located in roadways or parking lots shall be traffic rated 2 since the fsf is liable for the condition of their pretreatment devices the fsf ownerrepresentative should witness all cleaningmaintenance activities in order to verify that the grease interceptor is being fully cleaned and properly maintained e how to determine the size of an exterior inground grease interceptor as determined by the director the user installing a grease interceptor may be required to use either the sizing criteria of the manning formula or the formula described in the most recent edition of the california plumbing determine the size of said grease interceptor the manning formula for calculating grease interceptor sizing is gallons of interceptor   1   gpmfixture derived from manning formula x 2   total # fixture ratings of greaseladen waste streams + 3 direct flow from a dishwasher laundry washer glass washer in gpm x 4   24minute retention time components of equation   1 gpmfixture the following examples are derived from the manning formula it takes into account the slope  roughness of the pipe plastic used and pipe diameter size when applying the manning formula we arrive at the drainage rates of various pipe diameter sizes 05 inch pipe diameter   08 gpmfixture 10 inch pipe diameter   50 gpmfixture 15 inch pipe diameter   15 gpmfixture 20 inch pipe diameter   33 gpmfixture 25 inch pipe diameter   59 gpmfixture 30 inch pipe diameter   93 gpmfixture 2 fixture ratings of greaseladen waste streams in the data below fixtures that have a heavy greaseladen waste stream received higher values while fixtures with a light greaseladen waste stream received lower values common commercial kitchen fixtures and their corresponding rating each 2 3 or 4 compartment pot sink   10 1 or 2 compartment meat prep sink   075 prerinse sink   05 1 or 2 compartment vegetable prep sink   025 can wash   025 mop sink   025 floor drain   000 3 direct flow from dishwashers laundry washers and glass washers these flows must be added directly to the gpm flow because of their potential for discharging large quantities of water in a short time period since these appliances have pumps the manning formula cannot be applied to predict flow make sure to use the manufacturers discharge rate for flow in gpm but not less than the draw down rate 4 twentyfour minute retention time engineers have determined that when applying several criteria to determine proper grease animal and vegetable lipids separation using stokess law specific gravity of lipids etc a twentyfourminute retention time is required example no one a restaurant has the following fixtures in their kitchen all fixtures have a 15 inch pipe diameter  one threecompartment pot sink  one prerinse sink  one twocompartment vegetable prep sink  one dishwasher that discharges ten gpm using the formula to size exterior grease interceptors we get gallons needed for grease interceptor   15 gpm x 1 + 05 + 025 + 10 gpm x 24 minutes   15 gpm x 175 + 10 gpm x 24 minutes   2625 gpm + 10 gpm x 24 minutes   3625 gpm x 24 minutes   870 gallons  round up to the next size   a 1000gallon grease interceptor is required example no two a restaurant has the following fixtures at 05 inch pipe diameter prerinse sink at 15 inch pipe diameter  one threecompartment pot sink  1 prerinse sink  1 meat prep sink  1 vegetable prep sink at 30 inch pipe diameter  1 can wash using the formula to size exterior grease interceptors we get for the prerinse sink we take 08 gpm x 05   04 gpm for the 15 inch pipe diameter fixtures 15 gpm x 1 + 05 + 075 + 025   375 gpm for the can wash 93 gpm x 025   2325 gpm add 04 gpm + 375 gpm + 2325 gpm   6115 gpm x 24 minutes   1468 gallons  round up to the next size   a 1500gallon grease interceptor is required f how to determine the size of an indoor pointofuse grease interceptor 1 step one a determine the cubic contents of the fixture by multiplying length times width times depth b number of compartments times 24 inches long by 24 inches wide by 14 inches deep cubic contents 3 times 24 times 24 times 14 equals 24192 cubic inches 2 step two a determine the capacity in gallons one gallon equals 231 cubic inches b contents in gallons 24192 divided by 231 equals 1047 gallons 3 step three a determine actual drainage load the fixture is usually filled to about 75 percent of capacity with wastewater the items to be washed displace about 25 percent of the fixture content actual drainage load equals 75 percent of fixture capacity b actual load 75 times 10473 gallons equals 7855 gallons 4 step four a for design considerations it is good practice to calculate the flow rate in gpm equal to or greater than 75 percent of the fixture capacity b calculated flow rate for design capacity in gpm on 75 percent of fixture capacity 75 percent of fixture capacity equals 7855 gallons flow rate equals 7855 gpm 5 step five a select the grease interceptor that matches the calculated design flow rate note select the next larger size when the flow rate falls between two sizes b hence any value greater than 78 but less than or equal to 79 should be considered 79 in this example a grease interceptor with a minimum design capability of 79 gpm is needed g notification of change in ownership or closure of a food service facility 1 a change in ownership of a fsf shall be reported to the director in writing within thirty days of the ownership change failure to comply will result in a minor violation failure to submit records see  any fsf that goes out of business shall report such closure to the director in writing within thirty days of closure and shall ensure that any grease interceptor shall be cleaned and pumped before the building is vacated failure to comply shall result in an intermediate violation failure to maintain necessary equipment see 2 2008  fog discharge limits a types of wastes prohibited any water or waste which may contain more than one hundred parts per million by weight

is satisfied all new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of of this chapter part 1995  nature of variances the variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principal of law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature a variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners generally the characteristics should be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels the unique characteristic should pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners however variances which permit the lowest floor of a structure to be constructed below the base flood elevation must have unique characteristics which pertain to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels for structures with the lowest floor below the base flood elevation the unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself not to the structure its inhabitants or the property owners it is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding this need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare the long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited therefore the variance guidelines provided in the chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted the criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate part 1995  variance procedure a requests for variances to this chapter shall be heard by the city council in general accordance with the adopted city variance ordinance procedures as set forth in the zoning ordinance a request for a variance to this chapter shall be a separate and distinct variance not a part of another issue b in evaluating requests for variances the city council shall consider all technical evaluations all relevant factors standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the following 1 danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others  2 danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage  3 susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property  4 importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community  5 necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where applicable  6 availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage  7 compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development  8 relationship of the proposed use to the general plan and floodplain management program for that area  9 safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles  10 expected heights velocity duration rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site  and 11 costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer gas electrical and water system and streets and bridges c any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that 1 the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twentyfive dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage  and 2 such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property it is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the lake county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land d the floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions including justification for their issuance and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration federal emergency management agency part 1995  conditions for variances a generally variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot on onehalf acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level providing that the procedures of articles iv and v of this chapter have been fully considered as the lot size increases beyond onehalf acre the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases b variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures as defined in of this chapter upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure c variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result d variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford relief minimum necessary means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter for example in the case of variances to an elevation requirement this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter e variances shall only be issued upon a 1 showing of good and sufficient cause  2 determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship as defined in of this chapter to the applicant  and 3 determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense creation of a nuisance as defined in see public safety and nuisance cause fraud or victimization as defined in  of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances f variances may be issued for new construction substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of a e are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance g upon consideration of the factors of b and the purposes of this chapter the planning commission and the

commission att apart 1999  architectural and design review criteria and standards projects subject to architectural and design review shall be in general compliance with the following criteria a criteria promoting harmony of design of buildings 1 new buildings should be generally consistent with the scale form and proportion of existing development this can be done by repeating existing building lines and surface treatment and requiring some uniformity of detail scale proportion textures materials color and building form 2 the use of unusual shapes color and other characteristics which cause new buildings to call excessive attention to themselves and create a jarring disharmony should be avoided or reserved for structures of broad public significance 3 new buildings should strengthen the particular design features of their locale by for example framing views enclosing open spaces or continuing particular design features or statements 4 the height and bulk of new buildings should relate to the prevailing scale of existing development to avoid overwhelming or dominating it 5 the existing building line of a structure at the street line should be maintained unless a proposed setback conforms to an overall design plan or is part of a larger development plan 6 the relationship of structural mass to voids windows or doors of a front facade should relate to adjacent buildings 7 if several storefronts are located in one building they should be unified in design treatment  eg design of windows and door openings use of materials and color all storefronts should include display windows with a sill height not more than two feet from grade 8 building additions should be designed to reflect the existing building in terms of scale materials fenestration and color a change in scale may require a transitional design element between the addition and the existing building facade renovations should include as few different materials as possible 9 adjacent buildings of different architectural styles should be made compatible by such means as materials repetition of certain plant varieties screens and sight breaks b criteria promoting creativity and diversity of design 1 monotony of design in single or multiple building projects should be avoided variation of detail form and siting should be used to provide visual interest 2 architectural design is not restricted evaluation of the appearance of a project should be based on the quality of its design and relationship to surroundings c criteria regarding building design 1 where large structures are proposed massing should be broken up use of setbacks and other design techniques buildings with excessive blank walls are discouraged variation in color trim and building materials is encouraged in these situations building offsets shall be provided along each building to relieve the visual effect of a single long wall roof lines should also be varied an individual building should use a combination of story heights to provide further visual relief the development should incorporate masonry chimneys cupolas dormers skylights or belvederes 2 buildings should be designed so that the roofs are visually less dominant than the walls 3 the orientation of buildings to provide access entrances is allowed when the rear facade receives appropriate design treatment 4 new buildings should be oriented or designed with setbacks to minimize shadows falling on public or semipublic spaces d criteria regarding building details 1 a human scale should be achieved at ground level at entryways and along street frontages use of such elements as windows doors columns and canopies 2 mechanical equipment or other utility hardware on roofs the ground or buildings should be screened from public view with materials harmonious with the building or they should be so located as not to be visible from public view 3 building components such as windows doors eaves and parapets should be in proportion to one another 4 the structural lines of a building and its material should be retained at the storefront level for instance brick piers and columns should be carried down to street level 5 roof shape flat hip mansard or gable and material should be architecturally compatible with the rest of the building and should reflect the area pattern 6 materials should be selected for suitability to the type of buildings and the design in which they are used buildings should have the same materials or those that are architecturally harmonious used for all building walls and other exterior building components wholly or partly visible from public ways materials should be of durable quality 7 metal awnings are not recommended awnings should have solid colors complimenting the exterior building colors awnings should be in scale with the building design 8 facade renovations should not destroy or cover original architectural features of a building these details are often vital to the proper proportion of the facade the city encourages the removal of false storefronts 9 in renovations natural unpainted brick should be retained painted brick if weathered and losing its paint finish can be stripped using chemical solutions in many cases painted brick should remain painted to protect the older softer brick 10 brick and stone facades should not be covered with artificial siding or panels generally no material will look more appropriate on a facade than what was originally used 11 roof cornices should be retained repaired replaced or added as they cap or terminate a building when replacing or adding windows on a facade use window and window trim of the same size and character as the original e criteria regarding building color 1 in general no more than three colors should be used on a building the base color the major trim and the minor trim the base color should be the natural color of the masonry or a primary paint color the base color should relate harmoniously with the base colors on contiguous or close by buildings 2 light base colors will visually project and lessen the importance of the building mass darker base colors tend to visually recede and emphasize the trim the major trim color is used on the decorative elements which serve to define the facade of the building these include the upper and lower cornices window caps and sills and storefront columns 3 when the base color of the building is a natural brick the major trim color should be related to the brick color when the base color is painted the trim color should complement the base color the minor trim color should be used primarily as an accent to highlight the architectural details of the facade window frames and other trim elements can be emphasized by the minor trim color sometimes two colors can be used as a minor trim color depending on how much detail exists 4 general building color guidelines a use more subtle colors on larger and plainer buildings b use more colors and more intense colors on small buildings and those with elaborate detailing c relate paint colors to natural materials found on the building d relate paint colors to existing elements found on the building such as signs or awnings e encourage contrasting colors which accent architectural details f encourage colors which accent entrances to the building g avoid the most intense hues of a color h avoid using more than one vivid color per building i avoid using colors that are disharmonious with colors found on adjacent buildings j within the cb district use historically appropriate colors f criteria regarding buffering incompatible uses 1 project features that may have negative impacts upon adjacent properties should be buffered from the adjacent properties screening should be provided for roof equipment  parking and loading areas shall be screened from residential areas  garbage and dumpster areas shall be enclosed  landscaping shall be used to soften the impact of parking and loading areas 2 in areas where parking lot paving abuts the sidewalk raised planters can be used to partially screen parking areas low fencing can provide maximum screening while adding an attractive and decorative element to the streetscape g criteria regarding lighting exterior lighting when used can enhance the building design and the adjoining landscaping lighting standards and building fixtures should be of a design and size compatible with the historic character of the area building and adjacent areas lighting shall be restrained in design and excessive brightness avoided lighting must not create glare or shine into street rightofway h maintenance criteria 1 continued good appearance depends upon the extent and quality of maintenance the choice of materials and their use together with the types of finishes and other protective measures must be conducive to easy maintenance and upkeep 2 materials and finishes shall be selected for their durability and wear as well as for their beauty proper measures shall be taken to protect against the elements neglect damage and abuse 3 provision for washing and cleaning of buildings and structures and control of dirt and refuse should be included in the design improvements that tend to catch and accumulate debris leaves trash dirt and rubbish shall be avoided i 1 landscape design guidelines landscape design guidelines in site planning are based on three considerations a landscaping serves multiple functions  b landscape design should be consistent with good design principles  and c landscaping must be sensitive to the characteristics and maintenance concerns of the most common landscaping material namely plants 2 landscape functions a the most common function of landscaping is aesthetic through the use of plantings and other landscaping elements a site may be made more pleasing andor undesirable views may be hidden landscaping can help unify the composite parts of a site blend inharmonious land uses and buffer incompatible uses landscaping can compliment the design of a building add color to the built environment or soften spaces or surfaces that appear cold or unwelcoming b landscaping may be used to control soil erosion reduce harsh unpleasant sounds remove pollutants from the air control glare and reflection and slow the effects of erosive winds c shade trees and windbreaks are examples of landscaping elements used for climate control plants increase human comfort by shading the suns rays and intercepting solar radiation d landscaping elements can also block and divert winds or channel them openings when the prevailing wind direction shifts with the season a summer breeze can be captured and winter winds and rains diverted with careful placement of plantings and buildings long thin walls are the most effective windbreaks particularly if they are not completely impenetrable att apart 1999 performance standards purpose and intent  purpose and intent performance standards regulate the design and use of buildings or parcels of land in order to minimize public hazards and to prevent the creation of nuisances and other conditions which are potentially harmful or detrimental to the users of the property or surrounding area the purpose of the performance standards shall be to protect and improve the living and working environment the appearance of the community
