as parades festivals and other public gatherings result in nonsmokers finding themselves in close proximity to persons who are smoking which can be reasonably seen to have the same effects of exposure as when nonsmokers are exposed to smoke in the same enclosed space lighted cigarettes cigars and pipes of people standing or sitting in close proximity have the potential of burning those with whom they inadvertently come into direct contact and making the air quality and peaceful enjoyment of outdoor events unreasonably restricted for nonsmokers fwhen there is a presence of secondhand smoke in enclosed spaces or in outside areas where there is a public gathering resulting in people being in close proximity in places that are otherwise open to the public at large inevitably results in persons who do not smoke being forced to bear unwarranted health risks and inappropriate deprivation of peaceful enjoyment of the premises to which they have been invited or permitted to enter even

flood hazard controls ageneral standards 1statutory authorization the legislature of the state of south carolina has in sc title 5 and title 6 and amendments thereto delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health safety and general welfare of its citizenry therefore the city council does ordain as follows 2findings of fact the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation resulting in loss of life property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 3furthermore these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands that are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages bstatement of purpose and objectives 1it is the purpose of this section to protect human life and health minimize property damage and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities that serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction 2uses of the floodplain that are dangerous to health safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or that increase flood heights velocities or erosion are restricted or prohibited 3these provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains stream channels and natural protective barriers involved in the accommodation of flood waters and to control filling grading dredging and other development that may increase flood damage or erosion 4this section prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands 5the objectives of this section are to protect human life and health to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize floodblight areas and to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area 6the provisions of this section are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer tines streets and bridges located in the floodplain and prolonged business interruptions also an important floodplain management objective of this section is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding floodplains are an important asset to the community they perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters moderation of peak flood flows maintenance of water quality groundwater recharge prevention of erosion habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations recreational opportunities and aesthetic quality these functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state wherever possible the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced decisions to alter floodplains especially floodways and stream channels should be the result of careful planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs clands to which this section applies 1this section shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the city of goose creek as identified by the federal emergency management agency fema in its flood insurance study dated  with accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this section

invalidity and severability if any part of this section is declared invalid the remainder of this section shall not be affected and shall remain in force hwarning and disclaimer of liability 1the degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions 2flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes 3this section does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages 4this section shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this section or
