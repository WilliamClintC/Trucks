district pud a purpose and intent 1 planned unit development district regulations are intended to permit greater flexibility and consequently more creative and imaginative design for the development of a site than is possible under conventional zoning regulations it is further intended to promote more economical and efficient use of land which will provide over a period of time development of land that promotes the maximum benefit from coordinated site planning diversified location of structures and mixed compatible uses while also providing a harmonious variety of housing choices a higher level of amenities adequate buffering between adjacent uses and preservation of the natural qualities of open spaces the planned unit development procedure requires a high degree of cooperation between the developer and the city the procedure described herein is designed to give the developer general plan approval before completing all detailed design work while providing the city with assurances that the project will retain the character envisioned at the time of approval 2 planned unit developments have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties if allowed to develop simply under the general requirements of this addition to such potential planned unit developments also have the potential to create undesirable impacts on nearby properties which potentially cannot be determined except with a binding site plan landscape plan and architectural plan and on a case by case basis in order to prevent undesirable impacts from occurring all planned unit developments are required to meet certain procedural requirements applicable only to planned unit developments in addition to the general requirements of this public hearing process is required to review a request for a planned unit development this process shall essentially combine the process for a zoning map amendment with the process required for a conditional use with several additional requirements 3 planned unit developments are designed to forward both the aesthetic and economic development objectives of the city by adhering to standards consistent with sound land use and urban design and by controlling the site design and the appearance density or intensity of development in terms of more flexible requirements for land uses density intensity bulk landscaping and parking requirements in exchange for such flexibility the chapter 22 zoning 69 a s o f 7  3 1 1 9 planned unit development shall provide a much higher level of site design architectural control and other aspects of aesthetic and functional excellence than is normally required for other developments b general provisions 1 the common council may establish planned unit development districts which will over a period of time tend to promote the maximum benefit from coordinated area site planning by permitting the diversified location of structures and mixed dwelling types and mixed compatible uses adequate buffering and preserving open spaces shall also be provided in a pud a permitted uses all residential institutional business or manufacturing land uses may be permitted within a pud b mixed uses a mix of different uses within a pud district may be permitted if the common council determines that the mix of uses is compatible and appropriate to achieve the objectives of the pud c number of

the modification of requirements for density intensity and bulk building height setback area etc from what is permitted in the conventional zoning districts e parking requirements requirements for parking may be waived or modified within a planned unit development f minimum area for a planned unit development district planned unit development districts are intended to provide flexibility to encourage more creative design for all sizes of sites than would be allowed under conventional zoning to achieve this goal there is no minimum parcel or lot size area for a pud 2 planned unit

density and intensity bulk landscaping and parking and loading is otherwise listed as permitted in the conventional zoning districts or elsewhere in c approval criteria for planned unit developments 1 in recommending approval or conditional approval of a planned unit development pud the plan commission shall find that the application meets all of the criteria below or will meet them when the commissions conditions are complied with the common council shall also find in granting approval or conditional approval that all of the following criteria are met or will be met when the conditions to which the approval is made subject are complied with a quality design the pud represents a more creative approach to the unified planning of development and a higher standard of integrated design and amenities than could be achieved under otherwise applicable zoning district and subdivision regulations and on this basis modifications to the use and design standards established by such regulations are warranted b meets pud requirements the pud meets the requirements for planned unit developments set forth in this no modifications to the use and design standards otherwise applicable are allowed other than those permitted herein c consistent with comprehensive plan the pud is generally consistent with the goals and objectives of the city comprehensive plan as viewed in light of any changed conditions since its adoption d public welfare the benefits to the public and the community as a result of the pud will exceed any significant negative impact on the use and enjoyment of other properties in its vicinity the pud will not seriously harm environmental quality in the neighborhood or impede the orderly development of surrounding property e natural features the design of
