recreation areas and facilities it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services depending on the size of the development a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may at the option of the village board be provided in the form of private open space in lieu of dedicated public open space the extent of same shall be determined by the village board based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area in general a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities 20 village of montgomery subdivision equipment by the developer as

subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites the land dedicated requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of 1 estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the 2 maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein and then

school buildings or additions thereto if any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication or cash contribution in lieu of school site is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within ten years from the date of receipt it shall be refunded to the developer who made such contribution upon receipt of a written demand by said developer a fair market value the cash contribution in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation

subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary these occasions will arise when i only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park or school site that portion of land within the subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated  ii a major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site the remaining portions shall be required by dedication and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required 4 density formula the following table of population density is generally indicative of current and short range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall

demographic data in the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the table of estimated ultimate population listed herein he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the village board based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the village board by the park districts

the final plat 6 combining with adjoining developments where the subdivision of planned unit development is less than 40 acres public open space or a school site which is to be dedicated should where
