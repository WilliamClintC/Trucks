donald l hendren       mayor contents preliminary unit comparative codified ordinances of north baltimore  part one  administrative three  traffic five  general offenses seven  business regulation nine  streets utilities and public services eleven  planning and zoning thirteen  building fifteen  fire prevention s note  the arrangement and numbering of the codified ordinances into component codes titles chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal numbering system which is similar to that used in the ohio revised in accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification each section is selfidentifying as to code chapter and section number for example 30506 indicates that the code number is 3 the chapter number is 305 or the 5th chapter within code 3 and the section number is 06 the code and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal and the chapter number being all digits left of the decimal the section number appears right of the decimal as another example 11310 indicates the code number is 1 the chapter number is 113 or the 13th chapter within code 1 and the section number is 10  this numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion codes titles and chapters initially are oddnumbered thus reserving the use of even numbers for future legislation chapters are consecutively numbered except that penalty provisions are usually assigned the number 99 as used in the revised newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively numbered sections for example newly created   and  follow 57506 and precede 57507 to be placed in their logical position  enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in the section the history indicates the derivation by reference to either its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time or to its inclusion in any prior code histories indicate that the section contains new matter which

extensions of village sanitary sewer service lines will be eligible to enter into a rotary fee contract to qualify the original developer or owner must design locate size and construct new lines conforming to specifications approved by the village sewer superintendent in consultation with the village administrator andor the village engineer only new lines designed sized and constructed with sufficient extra capacity to service property in addition to the property the original developer or builder plans to serve at the time the new lines are constructed will be eligible for rotary fee contracts the village shall determine whether the proposed new sanitary sewer line project qualifies for a rotary fee contract if the cost of the project is supplemented by the village or northwest regional water and sewer district andor any other entity serving the public interest the developer or individual will be reimbursed only their proportionate share before the lines are accepted by the village andor rotary fees are collected the new lines must pass village inspection and testing the new lines will become the property of the villages sanitary sewer system and fall under the villages exclusive control as of the date said lines are placed in service 2rotary fees will be assessed and collected for an initial maximum period of ten years from the date the lines are placed in service village council reserves the right at its sole discretion to extend the period of time that rotary fees will be assessed and collected pursuant to a rotary fee agreement with a developer for a period of up to an additional ten years from the date the assessment and collection period in the original agreement expires the village administrator together with village legal counsel shall have the authority to specify in the original rotary fee agreement with the developer the requirements for submitting a request for an extension of the collection period 3developers and owners who wish to enter into a rotary fee contract must request that the village consider entering into such a contract with said developer up to twelve months before the subject project is to begin but no later than ninety days after the date the new lines constructed by the developer are placed in service requests must be in writing and filed in the village clerks office the developer or owner who extended the sanitary sewer line must file with the village administrator a notarized statement documenting the actual footage the estimated cost of the sanitary sewer line extension if prior to commencement of construction and the final cost of the sanitary sewer line extension within the ninety day period after the lines are placed in service actual final cost of a sanitary sewer line extension shall include all items of material labor and other directly associated costs including associated designated engineering and including costs for the opening of existing pavement and street resurfacing necessary to complete the installation excluded shall be general office expense pertaining to the purchase storage delivery and installation of all materials necessary for the extensions those costs are considered to be the responsibility of the developer in conducting normal business costs will be reviewed by the sewer superintendent andor village engineer for reasonableness and a confirmation letter approving costs will be sent to the developer by the village administrators office 4the developer must additionally pay an administrative fee equal to five percent 5% of the actual final cost limited to a maximum fee of one thousand dollars $1000 the administrative fee is to cover the villages cost of maintaining records on new connections receiving and remitting connection charges etc the full administrative fee is to be paid at the time the first rotary fee is collected and paid to the developer 5failure to file the notarized statement of actual final cost within ninety days of the date the line is placed in service will result in the developer or individual being ineligible for reimbursement 6the rotary fee to be collected from a party requesting a permit to tap a line subject to a rotary fee contract shall be determined based on one of the following methods afront foot method if a line is to be tapped to serve a single family residence or a single commercial or industrial project the rotary fee to be collected will normally be based on the frontage of the parcel being served by the proposed tap that is adjacent to the line being tapped and shall be calculated by multiplying the served parcels front footage by fifty percent 50% of the developers per foot cost for said line to be tapped unless it is determined that paragraph 6b should apply example actual per lineal foot cost rounded to the nearest whole dollar value multiplied by 50%   the per foot fee subject to collection by the village as a rotary fee amount collected from each end user is based on the front footage of the lot being serviced multiplied by the per foot fee actual cost of a main extension   $1600 per lineal foot $1600 x 50%   $800 $800 x 220 front footage of property tapping the main   $176000 $176000 amount to be reimbursed to the developer bbenefit conferred method alternate methods of determining the rotary fees to be assessed are necessary to accommodate large mains that have a high cost per foot where the tap is intended to serve a small project that will utilize a very small part of the mains capacity and which might make the new project economically unfeasible if the party tapping is required to pay a fee based on the method specified in 6a above if the calculated rotary fee for a requested tap intended to serve a single family residence or a single commercial or industrial project exceeds eight thousand dollars $8000 and the party requesting the tap requests that the rotary fee be determined based on the benefit conferred method a decision to apply method 6a or 6b shall be determined by the village sewer superintendent together with the mayor and the village administrator who shall make their decision by majority vote if they determine to charge a rotary fee based on method 6b they shall determine by majority vote the amount of the rotary fee to be charged in each case which shall not be less than twenty percent 20% of or exceed the amount that would apply if the method specified in 6a was applied cappeal if the party seeking permission to tap a line or the developer who constructed the line objects to the determination made by the mayor superintendent and the administrator that party shall have ten days from the date written notice of the decision is served on them to file written objections with the village clerk if an objection is filed the clerk shall convene three adult residents of the village who shall meet as binding arbitrators to resolve the objection to the decision of the mayor administrator and sewer superintendent the arbitrators shall review and make a binding determination of the method to be used to calculate the rotary fee and if the method selected is based on benefit conferred shall determine the amount of the rotary fee persons serving as arbitrators shall not be employed by the village or hold elected office in the village or serve in any paid capacity in village government nor shall any of said persons be employed by or related to the developer or the party seeking to tap a line the arbitrators shall meet within fourteen days to decide the issue the village clerk shall notify all interested parties of the date of the meeting the original developer or his heirs or assigns as well as the party required to pay the rotary fee when finally determined may appear in person or by agent or attorney and present their position on the issue  or they may elect to present their position to the arbitrators in writing in order not to delay projects any person required to pay a rotary fee to secure permission to tap a village sanitary sewer line may deposit the highest possible rotary fee that may be assessed with the village finance officer or clerk to be held without interest until the decision on the amount of the rotary fee to be assessed is final any excess deposit will be refunded 7if a sanitary sewer main extension is further extended by another developer no rotary fee will be collected and no reimbursement is applicable the village requires municipal ownership of all approved distribution and collection mains and does not impose costs for extensions of mains to be exempt from payment of a rotary fee extensions of a sewer main requested by another developer shall mean only those connections made to a sewer main covered by a rotary fee agreement that are sized and
