residential storm water rebates storm water runoff from residential properties can pick up pollutants such as lawn fertilizer pet waste and trash and carry those into storm sewers creeks and rivers storm water best management practices  or bmps  such as rain gardens rain barrels and soil quality restoration can be used in residential yards to capture storm water where it falls and allow for it to infiltrate into the ground methods exist to improve the quality of storm water runoff and increase local awareness of the importance of protecting our local streams and lakes the city has therefore created a residential costsharing program to provide for storm water best management practices rebates to assist in the promotion of such methods to capture and infiltrate storm water in residential areas 1 rebates for storm water best management practices a rain garden shallow depressions that contain permeable soils and native plants where rain water is collected from yards and downspouts rain water collected is for absorption by the roots of the native plants and also naturally infiltrates into the earth the rebate for a rain garden would be up to $400 to include actual associated costs upon installation of associated improvements with a limit of a onetime rebate per residence b rain barrel used for collecting rain water from roofs and downspouts this water can then be used to water plants gardens lawns or even for flushing toilets the rebate for a rain barrel would be up to $50 per rain barrel to include actual associated costs upon installation of associated equipment with a limit of a onetime rebate per residence c lawn soil improvement soil quality restoration is a simple but effective way to improve the ability of lawns to absorb rainwater a process of soil aeration and compost application improves the root systems of lawn grass and allows for better rainwater absorption the rebate for soil quality restoration would be up to $350 upon completion of improvements to include actual associated costs with a limit of a onetime rebate per residence 2 stormwater best management application a rain garden rebate application must be completed and approved by the

times of flood or which cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities c require that uses vulnerable to floods including public utilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement d protect individuals from buying lands which may not be suited for intended purposes because of flood hazard e assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the community to purchase flood insurance national flood insurance program 2 findings of fact a the flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the health safety and general welfare of the community b these losses hazards and related adverse effects are caused by occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to flood damages which create hazardous conditions as a result of being inadequately elevated or otherwise protected from flood and the cumulative effective of flood plain construction on flood flows which causes increases in flood heights and flood water velocities c this section relies upon engineering methodology for analyzing flood hazards which is consistent with the standards established by the department of

district 1 general intent activities placed in an exclusive use zone are those uses that cannot be readily classified as agricultural residential business professional office or industrial uses  however such activities are generally intense uses of property and shall be directed to areas land use designated for industrial purposes to this end the exclusive use zone a establishes specific standards classification of these activities within exclusive use zones will enable specific site location design and performance standards to be enumerated and applied for the basis of evaluation criteria such standards will protect the public health safety and welfare more adequately and will assure more equal treatment of the same or similar uses b avoids confusion concerning requirements by specifically delineating the standards to be applied to these activities perception understanding and enforcement of these standards will be enhanced c increases compatibility with adjacent uses exclusive use zones are intended to make the considered activities more compatible with adjacent uses allow greater flexibility in site selection for the activity and require the zoning of the site to be reexamined upon termination of the permitted activity within such an exclusive use zone 2 regulations in exclusive use zones the regulations adopted in this section relating to each exclusive use zone shall include but not be limited to the following a definition a detailed definition of the specific use or uses to be permitted b site design and location standards specific site design and location standards may be established prior to reclassification of property c operational standards performance standards may be established relating to those aspects of the activity that must be

reclassification shall be made according to the procedures set forth in the proposed exclusive use zone nov 05 supp 17645 eu1 exclusive use zone 1 sanitary landfill 1 findings of fact the following facts establish the need to place sanitary landfills into an exclusive use zoning district a characteristics of a sanitary landfill a sanitary landfill is primarily a oneofakind community facility which may be a necessary part of the communitys waste disposal system the high volume of heavy truck traffic and the potential for associated noise odor and other nuisancelike characteristics suggest industrial zoning would be appropriate however a sanitary landfill has limited duration use and the filled land may not be suitable for industrial uses that require substantial weight bearing foundations this limitation makes industrial zoning inappropriate for the location of subsequent uses on this land major factors in determining the proper site location for landfills are the suitability of the soil and underground drainage systems  neither of which is usually factors in the location of industrial zones therefore the site location criteria for a sanitary landfill must be defined separately b need for specific standards if proper sanitary landfill standards are not strictly adhered to the operation may result in an open dump and create a serious health hazard a completed landfill will settle and require periodic maintenance because of this settlement factor special design and construction must be utilized for buildings constructed on a completed landfill as a result of all these factors listed above sanitary landfills must be placed in an exclusive use zone that includes specific design standards and appropriate protection for subsequent use 2 general intent the major purposes and objectives of this zone are to place sanitary landfills in an exclusive use zone in order to establish site location and design standards which will a protect public health by preventing water pollution rodent infestation air pollution or other health hazards as would occur as a result of improper location design or operation of a landfill b protect public safety by requiring proper design of access roads to accommodate the heavy equipment necessary for collection transportation and disposal of solid wastes c improve compatibility with adjacent uses by requiring adequate screening and set back regular policing of access road and heavily traveled routes to the site and careful review of subsequent uses allowed on the landfill site d promote public welfare by providing a suitable location for the disposal of the solid wastes generated by the community and preserve prime agricultural ground e incorporate local siting approval as specified in iowa a this state requires that prior to siting of a proposed new sanitary landfill the city council must approve the site based on meeting certain criteria it is the intent of this section that to the greatest extent possible that the local siting approval process and the zoning district reclassification process run concurrently 3 other applicable state of iowa laws and administrative other state of iowa laws and administrative code requirements may apply to an application including but not limited to laws and rules related to the issuance or renewal of permits for construction and operation
