3 residential and agricultural districts ag ce rr ldr sr ur lrr mdr and hdr statement of purpose  agricultural districts the two agricultural districts are established in recognition of their contribution toward the townships quality of life and economic diversity carefully managed agricultural uses continue the practice of utilizing the land water and nutrient conservation the agricultural districts are intended to insure protection of some of the irreplaceable prime agricultural soils in the township unimpeded by the establishment of incompatible uses which could conflict with farm operations and further discourage agricultural production the protection offered type of zoning is intended to provide a basis for land tax assessments which reflect the existing agricultural nature a the agricultural ag district is established as a district in which the principal use of land is farming including dairying and livestock enterprises and forestry or other bona fide agricultural pursuits some areas zoned for agricultural uses are not intended to be preserved perpetually but to avoid premature loss of prime farmland the standards of this district provide an economic means of preserving land for future generations to determine ultimate use at an appropriate time agricultural uses can also be maintained of a residential planned unit development with residential units clustered on a section of a farm site while the remaining land is retained in agricultural production b the country estate ce district is established as a district where the principal use is residential with smaller scale farming and raising of horses and livestock typically an accessory use the health safety and welfare contribution of this district is to retain the rural atmosphere and quality of life while accommodating compatible very low density residential development  single family residential the single family residential rr ldr sr ur and lrr districts are established to provide for single family dwellings meeting a range of lot sizes and neighborhood character the intent is to a implement the development pattern proposed in the township master plan  b encourage the construction and continued use of single family dwellings  c discourage continuance of existing nonconforming uses which detract from the long term viability of residential properties  d accommodate two family duplex dwellings in appropriate locations  e discourage any use of land which may overburden public infrastructure and services and the areas natural resources  f accommodate higher density single family residential development in locations where the necessary public water public sanitary sewer and other services are adequate to accommodate the demands  g discourage land use which would generate excessive traffic on residential streets  h encourage wise use and development of lake shoreline in recognition of the existing small lot development patterns and the sensitive environmental ecosystem surrounding the lakes  and i prohibit any land use that would substantially interfere with the development utilization or continuation of single family dwellings in the district  medium density residential the medium density residential mdr district is intended to provide detached single family residential on smaller lots and attached residential townhomes with individual entrances and garages this district is intended for infill development within urban service areas of the township planned for higher density residential with the necessary public water

and land capabilities this district is intended for infill development within urban service areas of the township planned for higher density residential with the necessary public water public sewer

or under the security posted at the time application was made for establishing the facility g collocation 1 statement of policy it is the policy of genoa township to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless communication facilities and wireless communication support structures within the township and to encourage the use of existing structures for attached wireless communication facilities if a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or controlled by it where collocation is feasible the result will be that a new and unnecessary additional structure will be required in contradiction with township policy collocation shall be required unless an applicant demonstrates that collocation is not feasible 2 feasibility of collocation collocation shall be deemed feasible for the purpose of this section where all of the following are met a the wireless communication provider or property owner where collocation is proposed will accept market rent or other market compensation for collocation and the wireless communication provider seeking the facility will pay such rates b the site on which collocation is being considered taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility is able to provide structural support c the collocation being considered is technically reasonable eg the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference given appropriate physical and other adjustments in relation to the structure antennas and the like h nonconforming facilities and penalties for not permitting collocation if a party who owns or otherwise controls a wireless communication facility shall fail or refuse to alter a structure to accommodate a proposed and otherwise feasible collocation such facility shall thereupon and thereafter be deemed to be a nonconforming structure and use and shall not be altered expanded or extended in any respect in addition if a party refuses to allow collocation in accordance with the intent of this this action results in construction of a new tower the township may refuse to approve a new wireless communication support structure from that party for a period of up to five 5 years such a party may seek and obtain a variance from the zoning board of appeals if and to the limited extent the applicant demonstrates entitlement to variance relief which in this context shall mean a demonstration that enforcement of the five 5 year prohibition would unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent wireless communication services or that such enforcement would have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless communication services i variances the zoning board of appeals may consider a variance from the standards of this based upon a finding that one or more of the following factors exist as appropriate for the type of variance requested 1 for location the applicant has demonstrated that a location within a district or location in accordance with the standards of this not reasonably meet the coverage or capacity needs of the applicant 2 for no collocation the applicant has demonstrated that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs because existing structures can not support the facility that collocation would result in unreasonable interference or that reasonable financial terms are not available for collocation 3 for setback the applicant has provided engineering information that documents that the tower is self collapsing and that the setback area provided shall accommodate the structure should it fall or break and provide a reasonable buffer in the event the structure fails 4 for height the height requested is due to signal interference due to topography tall buildings masses of trees or other obstructions or would reduce the number of towers to the benefit of the township 5 for all the applicant has proposed means to mitigate any negative impacts for future collocation if found to be appropriate by the township and special design of the facility and site 6 for all the wireless communication and
