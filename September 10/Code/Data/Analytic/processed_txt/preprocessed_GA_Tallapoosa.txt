maintenance on many existing structures and parking lots throughout the enterprise zone 3 underutilization of valuable land c underdevelopment 1 the high rate of vacancy despite the availability of utilizable retail store fronts 2 the high rate of unused vacant land throughout the zone 3 building permit issuance for residential development in the zone has been nonexistent the last five years 4

poverty 1 poverty rates for this proposed enterprise zone are shown in the following census tract data 131439804005 poverty rate is 281 percent b general distress 1 the area surrounding exit 5 off of i20 has a number of abandoned and dilapidated structures which are preventing proper development of the interchange 2 the current design of the ga 100 and the exit 5 interchange is problematic as it restricts traffic flow currently as well as future development ga 100 throughout the interchange area needs to include two lanes in each direction and a dedicated turning lane for each on ramp east and west providing access for i20 this would allow longterm successful intensive development around the interchange without creating undesirable congestion this intensive development would provide a large quantity of jobs for the people in the enterprise zone district and surrounding region especially for people living in census tract 104 3 hundreds of acres of land surrounding this interchange lie undeveloped and exceptionally underutilized 4 poor general condition of the area c underdevelopment over the last five years the area surrounding exit 5 has seen a severe reduction and elimination of development despite being in close proximity to almost 40000 cars travelling by daily the utter lack of building permit issuance that last five years and the preponderance of undeveloped land is excellent evidence of the need for development incentives c building permit issuance for both of the proposed enterprise zones in comparison to building permit issuance for the remainder of the city indicates that there is a substantial decrease in development improvement and upkeep in the enterprise zones as compared to the remainder of the city d from 2008 building permits issued within the enterprise zones which encompass a large geographical area of the city and almost the entire retail and manufacturing areas of the citys incorporated area were substantially lower than the remainder of the city permits issued over this time period within the proposed enterprise zones number 60 permits  permits issued throughout the remainder of the city numbered 94 this data indicates economic activity within the enterprise zones is 36 percent less than the economic activity throughout the rest of the city and considering the large undeveloped tracks and the exceptionally high vacancy rate of existing buildings that the geographical area proposed for designation as an enterprise zone is experiencing substantial underdevelopment the state law requires that development activity in the nominated area be at least 20 percent lower than other areas within the local governments jurisdiction this building permit data provides adequate evidence that this criteria has been met exh 2013a958

the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding erosion and soils limitations in their natural state wetlands serve man and nature they provide habitat areas for fish wildlife and vegetation  water quality maintenance and pollution control  flood control  erosion control  natural resource education  scientific study  and open space and recreational opportunities in addition the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic wellbeing of many communities within the state 2 nationally a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining dredging filling excavating building pollution and other acts piecemeal or cumulative losses will over time destroy additional wetlands damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare 3 it is therefore necessary for the city to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities that may adversely affect wetlands b purpose the purpose of this article is to promote wetland protection while taking into account varying ecological economic development recreational and aesthetic values activities that may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined permitting process the objective of this

available map resources a national wetlands inventory maps nwi 1 nwi maps are the most commonly used maps most of these maps are at scales of 000 and correspond to united states geologic survey usgs topographic maps the minimum area mapped is usually one to three acres small wetlands and very narrow wetlands in river corridors may be missed 2 these maps were developed from interpretations of available aerial photographs  therefore mapped boundaries of wetlands do not reflect jurisdictional boundaries as would be determined if the federal delineation manual were used on the ground 3 only a small portion of the maps has been groundtruthed but nationwide efforts to assess the accuracy of the maps have been extensive accuracy varies upward from about 60 percent with most maps being at least 90 percent accurate 4 the strength of these maps is the spatial resolution often to within one acre which is relatively good nwi maps identify the location of wetlands and indicate wetland type using the cowardin classification scheme 5 the limitations of these maps are that wetlands that were cultivated at the time of mapping are generally not depicted and forested wetlands are poorly discriminated in some areas these two wetland types are a major portion of the wetlands resource particularly in areas of rapid growth and accelerated wetlands loss many maps have become quickly outdated 6 maps are available i national wetlands inventory us fish and wildlife service regional office 1875 century boulevard atlanta georgia 30345 telephone 14042668500 ii earth science information center us geological survey reston virginia telephone 1800usamaps 7 other information including information about wetland functions and values and options for their protection can be obtained from the epa wetland protection hotline telephone 18008327828 b county soil survey maps 1 these maps range in scale from 840 to 680 soil maps do not delineate wetlands but rather their presence may be inferred from the occurrence of soils classified as hydric by the soil conservation service from accompanying soil interpretation record data wetlands might cautiously be classified by type these maps were developed by trained soil scientists who examined vertical soil profiles at regular intervals along ground transects and generalized subjectively from them to the surrounding landscape on the basis of landform vegetation and other factors 2 these maps do not specify wetland type as do the nwi maps most published soil surveys report the acreage of each soil series in the survey area soil survey maps are extensively used as a secondary data source for wetlands mapping however hydric soil inclusions patches of hydric soil too small to map are probably common in many soils mapped as nonhydric but the extent to which this occurs is unknown it should also be noted that some soils classified as hydric are not hydric everywhere they are mapped  marginally hydric soils indicate wetlands only in certain landscape positions caution should therefore be used when inferring the presence of wetlands from soils classified and mapped as hydric 3 the advantage of using these maps is that they are sometimes available in areas where nwi maps are not yet available soil surveys might be used with caution to infer locations of cropped wetlands not included in nwi maps  to differentiate among some wetland functional types alluvial seasonally flooded versus isolated seasonally flooded when linked with the scs soils database which describes the physical properties of each soil series  and to categorize hydrologic and water purification function of specific wetlands 4 limitations of these maps are numerous many small but cumulatively significant areas that often are wetlands with hydric soil inclusions are not mapped because the soil classification systems used in soil survey maps classify soils in landscape groupings aquatic bed and many tidal or permanently flooded wetlands are typically mapped as open water not wetlands on scs maps areas classified as having hydric soils are not always wetlands in part because they may have been drained either prior to or after the survey was conducted this can lead to overestimation of current wetlands acreage many drained hydric soils can retain sufficient hydric features to result in their being classified by soil mappers as hydric even after decades of continuous drainage conversely not all wetlands contain soils that are classified as hydric and this can lead to underestimation of wetlands acreage wetlands may be the result of recent impoundment  in such areas it typically takes at least a decade for hydric soil features to appear moreover even the soils of some wetlands with hydric characteristics that have existed for decades do not appear on the scs hydric soils list 5 maps are available s department of agriculture soil conservation service field offices generally located in the county seat of each county c state soil geographic database statsgo and national soil geographic database natsgo maps 1 statsgo maps are available at 000 scale with about 100 acres resolution digital coverage maps will be available by late 1993 these maps include soils on federal land 2 natsgo maps are available at 000000 and are currently available showing the entire united states they do not include federal land 3 statsgo maps are generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960 scs has determined the map unit composition the groupings of soil types mapped as a single polygon or unit by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed scs county soil survey maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize each whole map unit 4 wetlands themselves are not delineated  rather their presence may be inferred from the presence of soils officially considered hydric from accompanying soils data which describe the physical properties of each soil series these wetlands landscapes might cautiously be classified by function 5 natsgo maps are also generally based on soil surveys completed since 1960 map units are the polygons of scss major land resource area mlra map the sample points of the national resources inventory nri are statistically aggregated within each mlra unit each nri record is keyed to the soil interpretation record soils database so that soil attributes relevant to wetlands function are available for each of the 300000 nri sample points 6 these maps are relatively new and have not been tested extensively against wetlands field data 7 both map types are the only currently available maps from which the landscapelevel water purification and flood control functions of wetlands might be inferred for all areas of the united states 8 the scaleresolution of the maps is inappropriate for most planning purposes at the local level also these maps cannot be used to infer the functions of an individual wetland inferences of wetlands functions at the landscape level would be based on hydric soils but not all hydric soils are wetlands in the case of the statsgo data the soil mapping units do not necessarily coincide with physical boundaries that are relevant to defining landscape functional units watersheds this could lead to some imprecision in estimates compiled on that basis the generation and compilation of thematic maps from statsgo and natsgo maps requires a mainframe computer with adequate storage advanced database management and gis software and a skilled computer technician 9 maps are available from national cartographic center usda soil conservation service fort worth texas d soil conservation service scs swampbuster maps 1 these maps are mostly at a scale of 000 or 000 and primarily cover cropland and areas closely associated with cropland 2 most maps were completed since 1987 and largely represent a onetime assessment  about five percent may be reassessed annually 3 wetland boundaries were hand drawn on recent aerial photographs the delineations were based on an overlay of hydric soils maps  hydrophytic vegetation and presence of surface water as visible from aerial photographs from multiple years  and in some cases field checking to confirm wetlands status 4 these maps probably represent the most extensive detailed and uptodate map source for wetlands in certain areas however because these maps are relatively new they are not widely used because of limited distribution 5 these maps are not for sale but can be viewed at state scs offices 6 the strength of these maps is that they are a useful complement to nwi maps because they include many of the wetlands that nwi misses specifically cropped and very small wetlands 7 the limitation of these maps is that because wetland boundaries were drawn on aerial photographs not printed for mass distribution the maps are difficult to access and compile and they often do not include prior converted wetlands e fema flood hazard maps 1 the scale varies depending on the locality and ranges from one inch equals 2000 feet to one inch equals 200 feet 2 maps show floodplains of 100 and 500year storm events based on analyses conducted since 1968 floodplains were delineated from topographic maps stream flow data channel cross sectional measurements and aerial photographs supplemented with limited hydraulic modeling and groundchecking 3 these maps are not extensively used to identify wetlands 4 the strength of these maps is that they might be used to help identify dominant water sources and transport vectors for specific wetlands located near rivers they also might be used to identify wetlands that if they store floodwater are likely to have greater value because they help protect downstream properties that otherwise are likely to be flooded 5 limitations are that fema maps are not available for all jurisdictions the 100 and 500year floodplains do not have any particular ecological or geomorphic significance annual twoyear and fiveyear floodplains are probably more functionally important and their correlation with wetlands or hydric soil extent or function is unknown their accuracy may be reduced in areas with very wide flat floodplains and backwater flooding boundaries may be outdated on maps of communities that have experienced rapid development since mapping 6 maps are available map distribution center federal emergency management agency baltimore maryland f usgs landuse land analysis maps luda 1 most luda maps are at a scale of 000  some are at 000 the minimum map unit size for the former is generally 40 acres ten acres for open water 2 these maps are based on interpretation of aerial photographs at a scale of 500 and recognize only two types of wetlands forested and nonforested wetlands additionally each map represents only one time period ranging from the late 1960s to the present 3 these maps are seldom used in identifying wetlands 4 the strengths of these maps are that they are the only source of digital wetlands data for nearly the entire united states and the only map data source that includes all landscape components not just wetlands this allows for better integration of wetlands data with other landscape data when interpreting the role of wetlands in the landscape 5 the limitation of these maps is that wetlands are grossly underestimated because the minimum map unit size is too coarse and also because a consistent modern definition of wetlands was not used during the mapping in particular forested cropped and aquatic bed wetlands appear to be ignored or severely underestimated 6 maps are available from earth science information center us geological survey reston virginia g state department of natural resources dnr landcover maps 1 these maps show 15 types of land use including seven wetland classes and have been produced at a scale of 000 they are not available for general distribution but are on file at rdc offices 2 digital versions of the landcover data are available from usgs center for spatial analysis technologies georgia institute of technology research institute baker building atlanta georgia 30332 this information is derived from automated classification of landsat satellite imagery as with nwi maps they cannot be used to determine jurisdictional wetlands as regulated by the us army corps of engineers although a useful complement to nwi maps they were produced at an accuracy of 85 percent and have not been thoroughly fieldchecked 2 reference cowardin lm et al classification of wetlands and deepwater habitats of the united states washington dc us fish and wildlife
