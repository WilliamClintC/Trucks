the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes flooding stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition  2 this stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species  3 clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat  4 improper design and construction of stormwater management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation  5 impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow  6 substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on the waters of the municipality  7 stormwater runoff soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities  8 the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes soil erosion stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety  and  951 erosion and sediment control  953   954 purpose the town of mamaroneck declares that the purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons protect property prevent damage to

town board is aware of the countrys current plague of shootings of and other types of attacks on innocent persons in schools in the workplace in places of worship in other public places and in homes the town board recognizes that it cannot solve this problem and is mindful of the right to bear arms given to the people by the second amendment to the united states constitution and by new york civil rights law  4 balanced against these rights is the towns objective of providing a safe work environment for town employees and a safe place for visitors to town buildings weighing these competing points the town board finds that safety is paramount therefore this article bans possession of firearms within the town buildings identified in this article by persons other than those permitted to do so by this article in enacting this article the town board is relying on the oftquoted phrase from the united states supreme courts decision in district of columbia v heller 554 us 570 626 2008 although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the second amendment nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding    laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings    and the supreme courts reiteration of that proposition in mcdonald v city of chicago illinois 561 us 742 786 2010 we made it clear in heller that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as    laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings     preceding heller and mcdonald the attorney general of the state of new york in informal opinion no 8975 opined that a village when acting in its proprietary capacity could ban possession of firearms within village hall in reaching this conclusion the attorney general relied upon barrett v kunzig 331 f supp 266 272 md tenn 1971 cert den 409 us 914 1972 which had observed it would seem clear that the united states government and its custodian general services administration could make use of its property as could any private citizen with his home hence it could prevent entry or make such conditions as it deemed proper as a precedent to entry after heller the tenth circuit court of appeals faced a case where banning the possession of firearms on government property was the issue in bonidy v united states postal serv 790 f3d 1121 10th cir 2015 the court of appeals upheld the constitutionality of the section of the federal regulations that prohibits carrying firearms while on property belonging to the united states postal service 39 cfr  2321  against a challenge from a person with a permit to carry a concealed weapon although the united states postal service usps is an arm of the government and not a private company the court noted  1007 firearms  1007  as a governmentowned business acting as a proprietor rather than as a sovereign the usps has broad discretion to govern it business operations according to the rules it deems appropriate    the bans on possession of firearms struck down in heller and mcdonald    regulated wholly private activity and applied to every citizen within the respective jurisdictions by contrast the regulation challenged here applies only to discrete parcels of land owned by the us postal service and affects private citizens only insofar as they are doing business with the usps on usps property and the regulation is directly relevant to the uspss business objectives which include providing a safe environment for its patrons and employees bonidy 790 f3d at 112627 finally this article is compatible with the federal statute 18 usc  930 that with certain exceptions bans the possession of firearms within those buildings owned or leased by the federal government where employees of the federal government are regularly present for the purpose of performing their official duties the town board acting in its proprietary capacity as owner of the town buildings defined below enacts the following ban on the possession of firearms in those town buildings  1008 definitions for the purpose of this article the following terms have these meanings exempt person  means police officers as that term is defined in subdivision 34 of  120 of the new york criminal procedure law  1 peace officers as that term is defined in  210 of the new york criminal procedure law  2 individuals in the service of the united states who whether in pursuit of their official duty or when authorized by federal law regulation or order are authorized to possess a firearm  and 3 employees of banking institutions or armored transportation companies whose jobs require them to transport cash but only when they are performing their duties for their employer 4 a a person who is an exempt person pursuant to either 1 2 or 3 of this section has that status under this article whether the person is on duty or off duty

 findings  intent a purpose 1 this chapter shall be known as the wetlands and watercourses protection law of the town of mamaroneck the town board of the town of mamaroneck finds and declares it to be public policy of the town to preserve protect and conserve its tidal and freshwater wetlands and watercourses  to prevent despoliation and destruction  to regulate their use and development  and to secure the natural benefits of wetlands and watercourses that are consistent with the general welfare and beneficial economic and social development of the town 2 it is therefore the policy of the town of mamaroneck to ensure maximum protection for wetlands and watercourses by discouraging degradation within them and within their buffers that may adversely affect these natural resources it is the policy of the town to encourage restoration of already degraded or destroyed wetlands watercourses and buffers and to ensure no net loss of wetlands and watercourse areas b enabling authority this chapter is enacted pursuant to the municipal home rule law and any and all applicable laws rules and regulations of the state of new york this chapter establishes a wetlands regulatory system separate from and in addition to any applicable requirements under state or federal law nothing contained herein shall be deemed to conflict with any such laws rules and regulations c findings of fact 1 the town of mamaroneck lands and waters are entirely tributary to long island sound a federally recognized estuary of national significance as such the protection of wetlands and watercourse areas within the town particularly for their water quality and habitat functions is essential to the longterm health  11026 wetlands and watercourses  1141  and viability of the sound 2 a significant amount of the original complement of freshwater and tidal wetlands and their associated buffers within the town have been lost or impaired by draining filling excavating building polluting and other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such areas buffers to existing watercourses have been built upon with a resultant loss of water quality four miles of the sheldrake river 19 acres of the east creek estuary and the twentysixacre sheldrake lake have been placed on the state priority waterbodies list due to stressed or impaired water quality remaining wetlands watercourses and their buffers are in jeopardy of being lost despoiled or impaired directly or cumulatively by such acts contrary to the public safety and welfare 3 the town board of the town of mamaroneck has determined that tidal and freshwater wetlands and watercourses are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding erosion and soil limitations wetlands and watercourses serve a myriad of important ecological functions which serve to benefit the residents of the town these functions include but are not limited to the following a protecting water resources by providing sources of surface water recharging groundwater and aquifers serving as chemical and biological oxidation basins andor functioning as settling basins for naturally occurring sedimentation  b controlling flooding and stormwater runoff by storing and releasing floodwaters and stormwater runoff  c providing nesting migratory and wintering habitats for diverse wildlife species including many on the new york state and federal threatened and endangered species lists  d providing areas of unusually high plant productivity which support wildlife diversity and abundance  e supporting plant communities specifically adapted for survival in lowoxygen environments andor brackish or salt water  f stabilizing shorelines by protecting against erosion caused by stream currents and the forces of wave actions  g serving as nutrient traps for nitrogen and phosphorus and as filters for surface water pollutants  h providing breeding and spawning grounds nursery habitat and food for various species of aquatic life  i providing recreation areas for swimming fishing boating hiking bird watching photography and other passive recreational uses  and j providing open space and visual relief

deemed appropriate by the town board and not prohibited by general municipal law  4533 to expand such system sewer rent rather than by taxation because a sewer rent more equitably distributes the cost since it is a function of usage computed based upon water consumption and is charged to all the users of the sanitary sewer system including taxexempt properties b the sewer rent law is intended to levy charges for sanitary sewer service based upon a propertys discharge of sewage into the sanitary sewer system the sewer rent law calls owners of real property that discharge sewage into the sanitary sewer system system users the owners of real property whose sewage is not discharged into the sanitary sewer system eg properties served by septic systems are not system users since the discharge therefrom does not enter the sanitary sewer system the owners of these properties are not subject to a sewer rent c there are properties that do both certain consumers of water such as golf courses have facilities such as clubhouses and locker rooms that discharge sewage into the sanitary sewer system but also consume water that is not returned as sewage to the sanitary sewer system such as water used to irrigate fairways or fill water hazards this chapter takes that distinction into consideration by imposing sewer rent for the facilities that do discharge sewage into the sanitary

the population of waterfowl in the town has caused conditions within the town which are disturbing to town residents in their homes and in public places the substantial number of waterfowl in the town and particularly on town property which is reserved for public use has caused an excessive amount of droppings to accumulate further the large numbers of waterfowl have become aggressive in their actions towards individuals and particularly small children all of this has resulted in the inability of the residents of the town to fully enjoy and utilize town conservation and recreation facilities further because of the increasing population of waterfowl these conditions have begun to affect private property as well b the board finds based upon extensive investigation the feeding of waterfowl by humans tends to increase the number of waterfowl in areas where the feeding has taken place and interferes with the animals natural feeding growth and migratory processes it provides additional sources of food for the waterfowl not found naturally and allows relatively small areas to support increasingly large numbers of waterfowl the board further finds that this situation
