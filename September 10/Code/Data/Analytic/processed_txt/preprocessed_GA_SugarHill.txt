article viii adult entertainment establishments division 1 generally findings and purpose a findings the mayor and council of the city finds that adult entertainment establishments if unregulated may lead to an increase in prostitution venereal and other sexuallytransmitted disease drug and alcohol offenses and other criminal activity  and the law enforcement resources available for responding to problems associated with or created by adult entertainment 292 establishments are limited and are conserved by regulating the method of operation and location of adult entertainment establishments  and based upon the experiences of other urban counties and municipalities including but not limited to atlanta and fulton county georgia  dekalb county georgia  gwinnett county georgia  city of smyrna

croix county wisconsin which experiences the mayor and council believe are relevant to the problems faced by the city and based upon the evidence and testimony of the citizens and experts who have appeared before such other bodies and the studies produced by such bodies the mayor and council take note of the notorious and selfevident conditions attendantto the commercial exploitation of human sexuality which do not vary greatly among generally comparable communities within our country  it is the finding of the mayor and council that based on the above public nudity and semi nudity under certain circumstances particularly circumstances relating to the sale of and consumption of alcoholic beverages in socalled nude bars or establishments offering socalled nude entertainment adult entertainment or erotic entertainment begets criminal behavior and creates undesirable community conditions among the acts of criminal behavior identified with nudity and alcohol are disorderly conduct prostitution and drug use and trafficking among the undesirable community conditions identified with nudity and alcohol are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhoods increased expenditure for and allocation of law enforcement personnel to pre serve law and order increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described and acceleration of community blight by the location of such establishments in particular areas  it is also the finding of the mayor and council that based on the above there is an increase in the commercial exploitation of human sexuality by owners of such establishments where alcoholic beverages are served or offered for sale for consumption on the premises such exploitation takes the form of employing or permitting persons to perform or exhibit nude or seminude bodies to other persons as an inducement to such other persons to purchase alcoholic beverages such commercial exploitation of such nude or seminude acts is adverse to the publics interest in the quality of life tone of commerce and total community environment in the city therefore the limitation of nude or seminude conduct in establishments licensed to sell alcohol for consumption on the premises is in the public welfare and is a matter of governmental interest and concern to prevent the occurrence of behavior and undesirable community conditions normally associated with establishments which serve alcohol and also allow andor encourage nudity and seminudity the mayor and council have reviewed or caused to be reviewed certain decisions of the appellate courts including but not limited to paramount pictures corporation v busbee et al 252 ga 250 1982  harris v entertainment systems inc 259 ga 701 1989

and city council make the following findings of fact a the city of sugar hill georgia hereinafter the city or sugar hill is authorized by the georgia constitution of 198 including without limitation paragraphs i and iii thereof and ocga  368262 to provide stormwater management services systems and facilities throughout the corporate boundaries of the city b in order to protect the health safety and welfare of the public the governing authority of sugar hill hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services c in promulgating the regulations contained in this section sugar hill is acting pursuant to authority granted by the constitution and laws of the state of georgia and its city charter to provide for stormwater collection and disposal d improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands threaten businesses and residences and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers streams and other bodies of water within the city e a system for the collection conveyance storage treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city and surrounding areas f the city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities which have been developed over many years the future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city and the additions and improvements thereto rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage protect control regulate use and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city in order to do so the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source 466 for its comprehensive program operation and drainagerelated capital improvement needs g failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by gwinnett county thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system h failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the potential degradation of the surface water quality in area waterbodies i the city is required under federal and state regulations ie the federal clean water act the citys national pollutant discharge elimination system hereinafter npdes phase i stormwater permit to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 and stormwater conveyance system into state of georgia or united states waters therefore it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge directly or indirectly into the public ms4 and stormwater conveyance system whether the property is private or public in nature j compliance with the regulatory obligations of the npdes phase i stormwater permit metropolitan north georgia water planning district and along with other city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services systems and facilities above what is currently being spent for water quality management drainage system maintenance flood control and other program activities k the cost of operating and maintaining the citys stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs replacements improvements and extensions thereof should to the extent practicable be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system l the professional engineering and financing analysis and related documents prepared by the citys consulting stormwater engineer properly assesses and defines the citys stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy m given the stormwater management program problems needs goals priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management maintenance protection control regulation use and enhancement of stormwater management services systems and facilities within the city in concert with other water resource management programs n stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city while specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time a stormwater management system and service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community o the stormwater needs in the city include but are not limited to protection of the public health 467 safety and welfare of the community provision of stormwater management services renders andor results in both a service and a benefit to all properties property owners citizens and residents of the city in a variety of ways p the stormwater management services rendered may differ depending on many factors and considerations including but not limited to location demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs and risk exposure it is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the citys stormwater management services which result in services to such properties and the owners thereof q a stormwater management program hereinafter swmp provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city user fee charges user fees and other mechanisms r the area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge s a schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs including but not limited to special service fees special assessments revenue bonds use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council t the existence of privately owned and maintained onsite or offsite systems facilities activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the citys swmp and the stormwater utilitys cost of providing stormwater management services andor stormwater management systems and facilities should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or a credit and such reduction or credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such services systems facilities activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems facilities activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property u it is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services systems or facilities together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services systems or facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital operating and nonoperating costs lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes definitions 468 the following words terms and phrases when used in this article

communitys collective affinity for traditional architecture consistent with late 19th century to early 20th century american styles and the original small town feel of business districts from that era these regulations are therefore based on the visual sensibilities of the average person in the community as well as widely accepted standards for ensuring a universally positive experience for downtown sugar hill visitors residents and businesses 107 attractive and integrated architectural and urban design features tend to improve an areas image raise overall property values attract new businesses and residents as well as enhance the quality of life furthermore visual harm to a widespread pattern of community preference as well as damage to the economic architectural and social

performance guidelines city of sugar hill 989 98 stormwater detention guildelines  general a stormwater detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak release rates when combined with those of all detention bypass areas in the same basin produce peak flowrates and flow velocities at the sites boundary line no greater than those which occurred at the same location for predeveloped conditions b the positive effects of stormwater management via onsite detention facilities diminish rapidly as the distance downstream from the point of distance increases and the smaller the facilitys contribution is as a percentage of the total runoff contributing to downstream flow the shorter the distance downstream that the benefits are realized because of these limitations onsite detention is effective at controlling flooding only when flow from the facility is a significant percentage of the total flow at the point of interest and only if the point of interest is immediately downstream the concepts of immediately downstream and significant percentage of total flow are inseparable the portion of a receiving watercourse one which receives and conveys runoff from a site which lies within a flow distance of onehalf mile 2640 linear feet downstream from the site shall generally be considered to constitute that portion of the watercourse which is immediately downstream however the total flow in the receiving watercourse may become very large relative to the flow contributed by the project site within a much shorter distance for this reason the substantial percentage test must also always be applied for purposes of these regulations the flow from a site represents a significant percentage of the total flow in a watercourse only when the ratio of the peak flow rate from the site to the peak flowrate in the watercourse including the contribution from the project site is greater than 5 percent c peak flowrate control shall normally be provided only for the 2year

construction criteria a detention facilities which take the form of normallydry basins ponds or lakes usually are created by damming a drainageway or watercourse such dams can take a variety of different forms the most common being earthen embankments and reinforced concrete walls each type of dam has different characteristics and the selection of the most appropriate type for a particular site should be made by a professional engineer and based on the physical features of the dam site the purpose of the dam the type of impoundment safety and maintenance requirements b for purposes of these regulations dams will be addressed separately for each of the three most frequently encountered types of detention facilities normallydry basins ponds and lakes a normallydry basin is one designed to impound stormwater runoff for only a brief period of time following a storm event the vast majority of the time the basin will be completely dry except for any normal stream flows which pass lakes and ponds on the other hand are designed to impound a body of water at least several feet in depth on a moreorless permanent basis lakes and ponds vary from one another only in terms of magnitude the magnitude of a lake is determined primarily from the height of its dam the size of its contributing drainage area and the volume of water it is capable of impounding for purposes of these regulation a pond is any lake having a dam height of less than 20 feet a drainage area of less than 100 acres and which is incapable of impounding more than 10 acrefeet of water c all dam design

landscaping principles and techniques as one of the criterion to be used in plant selection and design  principles and techniques of waterefficient landscaping the recommended principles and techniques to be considered are as follows a proper location and design  locating plants where they will naturally thrive and not require excessive water and maintenance to survive as well as grouping plants by water needs and limiting and concentrating high water using plants b turf selection  selecting turf grasses that can survive the variable rainfall conditions in this region and limiting turf areas c efficient watering  once plants are established avoid watering during periods of normal rainfall and during droughts watering every week to 10 days or less depending on the drought tolerance of the plants d soil improvements  loosening and breaking up the soil beyond the immediate planting area to allow better water absorption and to promote deep roots e mulching  using mulch to hold moisture in the soil which helps maximize the benefits of watering as well as preventing weeds f plant selection  selecting plants according to their watering requirements and optimum locations g
