editors discretion for purposes of allowing future expansion of the   findings of fact  intent and purpose a the city of winter park board of city commissioners are advised and informed that a pattern of illegal drug use and distribution of certain dangerous drugs has been linked in large part to certain pain management clinics operating in and around the central florida area and the city of winter park and distributing or prescribing dangerous drugs  and b certain opiate analgesic dangerous drugs that may be safe when used moderately or properly have been shown to be particularly dangerous when overprescribed by doctors in specialized businesses that are primarily focused on treating large numbers of persons who complain of any pain with very high doses of opiate drugs  and have been shown to be particularly dangerous when overconsumed by citizens and visitors who may obtain a large number of such opiate drugs by engaging in doctor shopping to obtain multiple prescriptions close in time from multiple doctors by failing to disclose prior recent prescriptions to subsequent doctors and then obtaining the prescriptions from multiple dispending pharmacies often by using multiple and false identities at both medical clinics and pharmacies  and c the dangerous overprescribing and excessive consumption of high amounts of those dangerous opiate prescription drugs has resulted in increased addiction of persons increased crime associated with such activity and resulted in a high number of deaths in central florida related to prescription drug abuse and has created an urgent situation requiring immediate action to reduce the threat to the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city of winter park  and d the state of florida has implemented a prescription drug monitoring program which could be an effective tool in the city of winter park to reduce successful doctor shopping or multiple prescriptions or multiple pharmacy filling of prescriptions and dispensing of potentially dangerous opiate drugs if local physicians are careful to check the database before prescribing potentially dangerous opiate drugs  and if reports are made to the database immediately when potentially dangerous opiate drugs are prescribed by local physicians or dispensed by local pharmacies so that other physicians and pharmacies can know that information  and e certain opiate analgesic drugs have been shown to be particularly dangerous when overprescribed by doctors or overconsumed by citizens and visitors  and f the illegal distribution of these dangerous prescription drugs increased crime associated with such activity and the high number of deaths in central florida relating to prescription drug abuse has created an urgent situation requiring immediate action to reduce the threat to the health safety and welfare of the city of winter park citizens  and g on  orange county mayor teresa jacobs prescription drug task force task force began a series of meetings to address the serious issue of prescription drug abuse in orange county enforcement healthcare and pharmacies prevention education and public policy  and h the florida legislature has identified concerns regarding the increased use and abuse of substances controlled by federal andor state law and the frequency of injury and death occurring as a result of the increased availability of controlled substances and certain dangerous prescription drugs via medical practitioners operating in pain management clinics or facilities  and i florida statutes require physicians and other persons dispensing prescription drugs management clinics facilities or offices to register with the state department of health in order to conduct such business  and j the negative adverse secondary impacts associated with certain pain management clinics includes the congregation of drug users and drug addicted persons outside of pain management clinics in a manner that has a negative effect on the willingness of residents to patronize nearby business and which disturbs nearby residents all hours of the day but particularly in the early morning and late evening hours thus disrupting other businesses and disturbing the peace and quiet of affected parts of the community  and k it is not the intent of this article to interfere with the legal and safe prescription dispensation or use of controlled substances it is the excessive distribution of a narrow class of opiate analgesic prescription drugs that are schedule ii and iii controlled substances except buprenorphine subutex&reg  and buprenorphinenaloxone suboxone&reg  which are used for treating addiction that this article seeks to regulate  and l under its home rule authority the city of winter park can pass additional legislation to further regulate pain management clinics and pharmacies as long as these additional regulations are not preempted in the law and are not inconsistent with the statutory provisions

the amount of infrastructure capacity necessary to serve the proposed development if such amount of infrastructure capacity that will be generated can be provided then the development shall be deemed to be concurrent and accordingly the requested capacity approval may be issued if the amount of infrastructure capacity that will be generated can not be provided then the development shall be deemed not to be concurrent and accordingly the requested capacity approval shall not be issued b in order to measure the demands for infrastructure capacity from development the following methods shall be utilized infrastructure system method sanitary sewer capacityestablished by florida department of environmental regulation demandcustomer demand based on past usage by similar users potable water

units by the student generation rates by school type as set forth in table 12 of the ocps facilities data inventory and analysis c in performing capacity evaluations for potable water and sanitary sewer capacity the evaluation is limited to an assessment of the infrastructure capacity available at the applicable water production plant or sanitary sewage treatment facility the concurrency evaluation does address the adequacy of capacity in water distribution pipes or sewer collection pipes necessary to serve the proposed development the city may require the developer to fund or for the developer to cost share with the city upgrades to the water distribution or sanitary sewer collection system in the general area of the project to address capacity sufficiency it is the responsibility of applicants to ascertain whether the water distribution system or sewer collection system is adequately sized or in place as is necessary for that development the performance of concurrency evaluations and the issuance of concurrency approvals does not relieve applicants of the responsibility to obtain permits from applicable state or federal agencies requiring such approvals d in performing concurrency evaluations for drainage the evaluation is not limited to an assessment of the conformance to the citys storm water management ordinance as contained in this land development city may require the developer to fund or for the developer to cost share with the city upgrades to the storm water conveyance system in the general area of the project to address capacity sufficiency

zoning regulations to be effectively applied this article contains strict definitions of fine dining restaurants nonfine dining restaurants and coffee shops bakery and dessert restaurants which are either permitted uses or require conditional use approval and cocktail lounges taverns and bars as well as fast food restaurants which are prohibited uses generally if there is consumption of either

premises is permitted without conditional use approval otherwise if a restaurant does not fit under one of the permitted uses in subsection b6 above then conditional use approval is required 3 among the issues reviewed for conditional uses in this district the adequacy of parking is often the most contentious a frequent proposition is that the type of business its menu its hours or its size will

other relevant materials as may be deemed necessary to the planning and zoning commission andor city commission following review and acceptance of the supplementary materials the city commission may at its discretion provide the final approval by the adoption of the zoning map amendment ordinance at its second reading the city commission may request a subsequent review and recommendation by to the planning and zoning commission prior to consideration of the second reading of the zoning map amendment ordinance preliminary action does not establish a contractual obligation for the city to issue development orders and building permits until the final approval is granted j development agreements 1 the approval of zoning map amendments may require the utilization of a development agreement the development agreement incorporates the plan submissions written application materials and verbal representations of the applicant as well as including any special conditions and restrictions a development agreement may be approved by the city commission coincident with the initial final approval of the zoning map amendment or conditional use or may be executed at a later time unless specifically specified in the development agreement development agreements utilized pursuant to zoning map amendments or conditional use approvals do not have to conform to the requirements of

public hearing for their review as part of the official agenda packet together with a staff report analysis and other pertinent information shall be the basis for action by the planning and zoning commission if those plans are substantially modified then such application shall be postponed and readvertised for a subsequent meeting 2 similarly when the planning and zoning commission makes a recommendation on an application pursuant to specific plans and those plans are significantly changed for submission to the city commission public hearing then the significantly changed plans shall first be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission for recommendation before they are considered by the city commission for approval 3 the city commission shall not act on any application containing significantly changed plans but shall refer the significantly changed plans back to the planning and zoning commission for subsequent review and recommendation unless such changes are in response to specific conditions of approval made by the planning and zoning commission 4 whenever an applicant requests a work session or preapplication meeting before the planning and zoning commission or city commission or both combined commissions such plans shall be submitted at least two weeks prior to such meeting and the planning staff shall prepare for review by such commissions a preliminary report outlining the extent of the zoning variances and other issues that such application will entail l significant changes to buildings or approved plans 1 significant changes to buildings or approved plans are defined below there are two times when plan documents are reviewed following a preliminary approval or following a final approval with respect to a determination of significant change the first time is following a preliminary approval when plan documents are submitted for final approval as required by this second time is when plan documents are submitted for site development and building permits in the first situation the planning staff based upon the criteria set forth below shall make a staff recommendation indicating the facts and conditions as they understand them to be the planning and zoning commission shall then following the required public hearing and based upon the criteria set forth below make a recommendation either that a no significant changes have been made  or b that significant changes have been made but those changes are acceptable to the planning and zoning commission  or c that significant changes have been made which are not acceptable to the planning and zoning commission in which case the developer must amend such plan documents and resubmit such plans for final approval in order to build the project in conformance with the parameters of the original preliminary approval 2 this action by the planning and zoning commission is a recommendation the city commission shall then following the required public hearing make the final decision either that a no significant changes have been made  or b that significant changes have been made but those changes are acceptable to the city commission  or c that significant changes have been made which are not acceptable to the city commission in which case the developer must amend such plan documents and resubmit such plans for final approval in order to build the project in conformance with the original parameters of the preliminary approval 3 in the second instance the planning and development director must insure that the plan documents submitted for site development and building permits are consistent with the plan documents given final approval by the city commission any such determination of significant change by the planning and community development director in this instance may be appealed to the city commission following recommendation from the planning and zoning board in order to determine whether a significant change shall be deemed to occur the following criteria shall be used a when there is an increase in the height of a building of more than one foot  or b when there is an increase in the square footage of a proposed building of more than 500 square feet above grade  or c when there is an increase in the impervious lot coverage of more than 1000 square feet  or d when there is a change in the architectural style of the building  or e when there is a major shift or relocation of the site and floor plans or the distribution of uses within the building or major shift or relocation in the features of building location storm water retention parking area andor driveways  or f when additional variances are requested that have not previously been made part of the public record in the review by the planning and zoning board andor the city commission  or g when the planning director or city commission believes a material change has been made in a plan detail that was critical to the consensus or decision made by the board or commission 4 the planning and zoning commission and the city commission will allow only the submission of one plan change to be reviewed under this section for example a project cannot increase the building height by one foot which is not a significant change and then request another determination for another additional foot increase in height and then another request and so on m

various types of businesses certain types or sizes of buildings or certain types of licenses or business certificates have been deemed to require a conditional use approval prior to beginning operation or development these conditional use approval requirements are to insure that such activities and projects are in conformance with the comprehensive plan policies and that they do not result in lack of compatibility and adverse effects with the type and size of buildings and the character of the surrounding area aside from the ability to deny such conditional uses or impose conditions upon such conditional use approvals in order to achieve these objectives the city may also reduce the size height and intensity of such buildings structures and uses of land below that normally permitted within the zoning district in order to insure that these objectives are achieved 2 the planning and zoning board may recommend and the city commission may impose conditions upon the approval of a conditional use request conditional use applications encompass the entire site or property involved and do not relate only to the component of the plans requiring such conditional use approval for residential development projects other than one single family home or duplex the total square footage of the collective buildings shall be utilized to determine if a conditional use requirement applies but for the type of notice the size of the largest individual building shall be the determinant conditions may be imposed regarding the manner in which the entire conditional use property is developed and used and the city may impose restrictions otherwise not applicable by other typical land development codes as part of the conditional use approval such conditions may also include trial periods or time limits placed upon an approval such conditions may also be limited to the time period during which the applicant maintains the business certificate or occupational license for the business requesting such conditional use approval such conditions may also require infrastructure improvements for transportation mobility water sewer storm water and such b requirements for public notice and hearings the public notice requirements procedures and regulations for the review of conditional uses by the planning and zoning commission and the city commission shall be the same as outlined for zoning changes and amendments except as outlined below c approval of conditional uses 1 a simple majority of the city commission may override any recommendation for denial or modify any conditions of approval in the recommendation of the planning and zoning board 2 in order to streamline the development plan approval process the city commission in the approval of conditional uses may also grant limited exceptions from the terms of this article those exceptions shall be limited to the size number and height of accessory structures such as walls fences and signs and shall also be limited to site and building design features involving floor area ratio but for floor area ratio said exemption shall be limited exclusively to floor area ratio in a parking garage and further limited to no more than five percent of the total floor area ratio permitted by this article the location or number of parking spaces the location of storm water retention facilities building setbacks

for phased projects without timetables specified in the conditional use approval or in the accompanying development agreement all phases must be under construction within five years from the date construction commences on the first phase 2 the city commission may extend conditional uses or reestablish conditional use approvals that have expired at the discretion of the city commission the advertisement and notification requirements shall not apply to the reestablishment of expired conditional uses except that for conditional uses approvals involving buildings over 10000 square feet or involving threestory buildings within the central business district geographic area as defined in this code the advertisement and notification requirements shall apply the same as for the initial approval of the conditional use in order for the city commission to extend or reestablish such conditional use approvals that have expired for projects requiring citywide notice the alternative use of a quarterpage display advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation shall substitute however for the reestablishment of any such conditional use requiring citywide notice that has been expired in excess of three years the reestablishment of such conditional use shall require the citywide notice e conditional use approval process 1 for conditional uses approvals involving buildings over 10000 square feet or for threestory buildings within the central business district geographic area as defined in this code there is a twostep process established involving a preliminary approval and then a final development plan approval preliminary approvals may be recommended by the planning and zoning board and may be approved by the city commission except for threestory buildings within the central business district and construction within stream floodplains which shall require two public hearing approvals of the preliminary conditional use by the city commission otherwise at the discretion of the applicant the applicant may apply and request a final development plan approval in one step by both the planning and zoning board and the city commission if all relevant issues are addressed and complete submissions are approved a preliminary approval is the first step of a twostep approval process the second step is the final development plan approval which requires the resubmission of additional plan documents or other relevant materials as may be deemed necessary to the planning and zoning board for recommendation and for action by the city commission the city commission may except for threestory buildings within the central business district and for construction within stream floodplains at its choosing delegate the subsequent review and final development plan approval authority to the planning and zoning board such as providing for a final development plan approval subject to the planning and zoning boards review and approval of a landscape plan

uses certain conditional uses require other more specific information and a determination that criteria and standards are achieved these are as follows 1 drivein business a the city as an existing urbanized area does not lend itself to the establishment of new transportation corridors or to the expansion of existing streets as a result the city must strive to maintain the most effective and efficient movement of traffic on the existing road network since the drivein components of any business can increase traffic congestion create safety hazards and adversely impact adjacent neighborhoods or existing streets when they are improperly designed or located the city has determined that in order to protect the safety and convenience of its citizens drivein components of any business shall be conditional uses to be disapproved approved or approved with conditions in addition to the site plan and building plan submittals previously outlined all applications for driveins shall contain the following information if required by the city planning staff 1 applicants shall submit a traffic data and impact analysis including the average daily traffic on adjacent streets and

location of other similar businesses within this area of the city b in order for the city to undertake its own analysis of these applications all the above data shall be submitted no less than 30 days prior to the planning and zoning commission meeting date this shall allow sufficient time to conduct traffic counts turning movement studies and to determine the adequacy of data submitted as well as to question conclusions and findings by requesting supplementary information to back up previous submissions c it is the intention of the city to permit drivein businesses only when they impose no substantial adverse traffic impacts on adjacent streets and are consistent with existing character of the area it is not the intention to permit driveins for a parcel which is not suited by location or configuration for such use thus no permit shall be issued unless the city commission shall first determine that 1 it is generally necessary or appropriate for the general welfare and public interest  2 that the proposed use is consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and that the property values are reasonably safeguarded  3 that the size of the property is enough to accommodate the use during peak periods without substantial adverse effect on adjacent streets  4 that no significant deterioration of traffic flow andor turning movements will result on adjacent streets from this use  5 that no undue traffic safety or traffic hazards will be created 2 alcoholic beverages licenses and restaurant bar tavern cocktail lounge conditional uses the city has established that restaurants bars taverns and cocktail lounges are conditional uses in commercial zoning districts close to residential properties due to the potential for negative offsite impacts that these establishments and their patrons may have on nearby residents the enactment of this conditional use requirement has established that all existing and proposed establishments of this type are conditional uses renovations changes in decor floor plan menu and changes to operating hours to any time before  pm are not deemed to be significant changes which require amendment of conditional use changes which result in the addition of the building area seating or live amplified musical entertainment are deemed to be significant changes which require amendmentapproval of a conditional use in addition to the customary standards associated with condition uses the following standards or criteria shall also be met in approving these conditional uses the proposed use is compatible with the

tower modifications an application to modify an existing tower or base station which does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station shall be approved subject only to building permit review and administrative review to determine whether the proposed modification constitutes a substantial modification a modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of a tower or base station if it meets any of the following criteria 1 for towers outside of public rightsofway it increases the height of the tower by more than ten percent or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet whichever is greater  for those towers in the rightsofway and for all base stations it increases the height of the tower or base station by more than ten percent or ten feet whichever is greater  2 for towers outside of public rightsofway it protrudes from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance whichever is greater  for those towers in the rightsofway and for all base stations it protrudes from the edge of the structure more than six feet  3 it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved but not to exceed four cabinets  4 it entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site of the tower or base station  5 it would defeat the existing concealment elements of the tower or base station  or 6 it does not comply with conditions associated with the prior approval of construction or modification of the tower or base station unless the noncompliance is due to an increase in height increase in width addition of cabinets or new excavation that does not exceed the corresponding substantial change thresholds identified above the changes in height resulting from a modification should be measured from the original support structure in cases where the deployments are or will be separated horizontally such as on buildings rooftops  in other circumstances changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the spectrum act b antenna colocations with minimal change to physical dimensions an application to colocate an antenna beyond an initial previously approved antenna upon a tower or upon certain nontower structures meeting the following

adopted  repealed the former  58428 and enacted a new  58428 as set out herein the former  58428 pertained to buildings or other equipment storage and derived from the original codification removal of abandoned antennas and towers a the city commission finds and declares that because of the national public policy of insuring that the wireless communications industry and its evolving new technologies are accommodated notwithstanding the undesirable effects that towers may have on the aesthetics of communities and neighborhoods there is a compelling public interest in insuring that towers are promptly disassembled dismantled and removed once they are no longer being used further the city commission finds that there is substantial risk that towers may cease being used in large numbers if there is a concentration or consolidation of competitors within the industry or if even newer technologies arise eliminating the need for towers b accordingly any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 180 days shall be deemed to be abandoned determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the city building official who shall have the right to request documentation andor affidavits from the tower owneroperator regarding the issue of tower usage and other information failure or refusal for any reason by the owneroperator to respond within 20 days to such a request shall constitute prima facie evidence that the tower has been abandoned upon a determination of abandonment and notice thereof to the owneroperator the owneroperator of the tower shall have 180 days within which to 1 reactivate the use of the tower or antenna or transfer the tower to another owneroperator who makes actual use of the tower or antenna within the 180day period  or 2 dismantle and remove the tower or antenna c at the earlier of 181 days after the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal any conditional use andor variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire d notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 58429b upon abandonment of a tower as determined under subsection 58429b by the city building official and the failure or refusal of the owneroperator of the tower or antenna to either reactivate the tower or antenna or dismantle and remove it within 180 days as required by subsection 58429b the following persons or entities the responsible parties shall have the duty jointly and severally to remove the abandoned tower or antenna 1 the owner of the abandoned towerantenna and if different the operator of the abandoned towerantenna  2 the owner of the land upon which the abandoned tower is located  3 the lessee if any of the land upon which the tower is located  4 the sublessee or sublessees if any of the land upon which the tower is located  5 any communication service provider who or which by ceasing to utilize the tower or otherwise failing to operate any of its transmitters or antennas on the tower for which it leased space or purchased the right to space on the tower for its transmitters or antennas and such ceasing or failure to utilize the tower in fact caused the tower to become abandoned  6 any person to whom or entity to which there has been transferred or assigned any licenses issued by the federal communications commission and under which the tower owneroperator operated the tower  7 any person or entity which has purchased all or a substantial portion of the assets of the tower owner or operator  8 any entity which has merged with or

abandonment  or 3 for placement into a communication tower removal account established by the city the adequate amount of an irrevocable cash deposit to cover the cost of removal of the tower the city shall be entitled to use the funds deposited into such account for the necessary removal of any tower within the city the adequate amount shall be $3000 per foot of height for monopole towers and $10000 per foot of height for lattice of guyed towers in no event shall any one service provider be required to place more than $3000000 into the account for the cumulative number of towers under its control and located within the city nonconforming uses a not expansion of nonconforming use towers that are constructed and antennas that are installed in accordance with the provisions of this article shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure b preexisting towers preexisting towers shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist

if no permit is obtained or if such permit expires the tower or antenna shall be deemed abandoned as specified in section 58429 d future nonconforming uses if at any time after  the city commission finds 1 that the technologies pertaining to towers have changed such that wireless communications can be readily provided with no towers or with towers or other structures that are substantially less intrusive to residential and commercial areas and substantially more aesthetic for neighborhoods and commercial areas and 2 that the service providers in the city are making frequent use of the new technologies in the installation of new communication systems or the expansion of existing systems whether such installations or expansions are occurring in the city or elsewhere the city commission may declare to be nonconforming uses all towers then existing in residential professional office and commercial zones in the city and which have been erected pursuant to building permits issued on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives the city commission shall declare such towers to be nonconforming uses in an ordinance which amends this ordinances to make such towers nonpermitted uses altogether in residential professional office and commercial zones and simultaneously to make the new technologies permitted uses or conditional uses in those zones the city commission may then set such time limits as are reasonable and legally permissible for the service providers and tower owneroperators to remove the nonconforming towers and replace them with the new technologies this section shall be effective only if and to the extent not prohibited or preempted by state or federal law appeals final written decisions of the building official or the planning
