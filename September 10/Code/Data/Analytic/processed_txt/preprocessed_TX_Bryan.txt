finds that 1 the special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 these flood losses are the result of the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of special flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage 3 the city in an attempt to require the development of property in such a way as to not adversely impact on potential stormwater and flooding has caused this chapter to be enacted  10262010 statement of purpose it is the purpose of this article to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by provisions designed to 1 protect human life and health  2 maximize the cost effectiveness of expenditures of public money for flood control projects  3 minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas  6 help maintain a stable tax base for the city by providing for the organized development of all areas in such a manner as to minimize future areas of flooding  and 7 ensure that potential property owners are notified that property is in a special flood hazard area  10262010 methods of reducing flood losses to accomplish its purpose this article uses the following methods 1 restricts or prohibits uses that are dangerous to health safety or property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities  2 requires that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage throughout their intended life span  3 controls the alteration of natural floodplains their protective barriers and stream channels which help accommodate or channel flood waters  4 prevents the construction of barriers which will divert floodwaters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards  and 5 controls development which would cause greater erosion or potential flood damage such as grading dredging filling and excavation  10262010 definitions in this article appeal means a request to the

debris and stormwater pollution the responsible party is responsible for the maintenance and performance of the temporary pollution control measures until permanent measures are in place the pollution controls are designed and should be selected by the responsible party to achieve the best results in controlling the pollution b temporary pollution control measures during construction this subsection provides examples of temporary pollution control measures that can be used to control erosion and sedimentation 1 structural control of soil erosion a stilt fences may be utilized where necessary to retain the sediments from disturbed areas within the site and decrease the velocity of sheet flows b straw bales may be utilized where necessary to retain sediments from disturbed areas within the site and decrease the velocity of sheet flows straw bales are particularly useful in paved areas where silt fences cannot be erected c stabilized construction entrances shall be designed to reduce the amount of soil tracked off the construction site by vehicles leaving the site a stabilized construction entrance should be utilized to control tracking of material from the site the responsible party shall ensure that vehicles entering and leaving the construction site use the stabilized construction entrance the owner or operator of a vehicle entering or leaving a construction site may not track soil off the construction site d vegetative buffer strips of appropriate size should be maintained where necessary and practical to aid in reducing the velocity of stormwater and in trapping sediments in the stormwater leaving the site a vegetative buffer will usually suffice as a structural control until final stabilization is accomplished e inlet protection barriers must be installed around all inlets to the storm sewer system and remain in place until the area surrounding the inlet is paved or stabilized sufficiently to prevent silt laden runoff from entering the storm sewer system 2 waste controls waste disposal must be accompanied in a manner so that no solid wastes including building materials hazardous substances oil or packaging leave the site except for disposal at an appropriate approved solid waste management facility in conformance with the texas solid waste disposal act to the extent practicable no solid waste including building materials hazardous substances or oil may be allowed to enter the city ms4 city streets or waters of the united states building materials include but are not limited to uncovered stockpiles of soil sand dry cement lumber bricks packaging or other products used in construction the general contractor andor builder to whom the development permit andor building permit is issued is responsible for the conduct of all subcontractors with regards to disposal of wastes generated by the construction activities at the site 3 dust control reasonable measures shall be taken to control dust particulate matter and windblown debris 4 hazardous material storage  chemicals paints solvents fertilizers and other toxic materials must be stored in waterproof containers except during applications the contents must be kept in trucks or in storage facilities runoff containing such materials shall be collected removed from the site and disposed of at an approved solid waste or chemical disposal facility 5 concrete trucks the responsible party may not allow the owner or operator of a concrete truck to wash out or discharge surplus concrete or drum wash water at a construction site unless the surplus concrete or drum wash water in concrete trucks is discharged at a facility on the construction site that will retain all concrete wash waters or leachates including any wash waters or leachates mixed with stormwater concrete wash waters and leachates may not be allowed to enter the ms4 city streets adjacent properties the waters of the united states or ground waters c final pollution control measures post construction  these measures specific to the type of site provide final stabilization of the construction sites 1 all soil disturbing activities at the site have been completed and a uniform eg evenly distributed without large bare areas perennial vegetative cover with a density of 70 percent has been established on all unpaved areas and areas not covered by permanent structures or equivalent permanent stabilization measures such as the use of riprap gabions or geotextiles have been employed 2 for construction activities on land used for agricultural purposes eg pipelines across crop or range land final stabilization may be accomplished by returning the disturbed land to its preconstruction agricultural use areas disturbed that were not previously used for agricultural activities such as buffer strips immediately adjacent to surface water and areas which are not being returned to their preconstruction agricultural use must meet the final stabilization conditions of condition c1 above 3 acceptance of improvements by the city can occur before the final stabilization coverage requirement is met if the developer agrees to maintain the stabilization until coverage is achieved and all other permanent measures are complete ie performance bond 4 once final stabilization has been achieved the responsible party shall notify the administrator or designated representative that final stabilization has been achieved 5 erosion control structures must be provided where necessary to control erosive velocities in unlined channels or swales leaving the site 6 sediment traps must be provided on the site as necessary to control sedimentation from concentrated stormwater discharges into an environmentally sensitive area individual assessments must be made on a sitespecific basis however a rock rubble low berm must be installed around an outfall that discharges directly into an environmentally sensitive area unless this requirement is waived by the administrator because the responsible party has installed another type of sediment trap that provides equal or better protection d scheduling of control measures  pollution control measures must be implemented in a sequence that will provide maximum stormwater pollution control based on the following principles 1 down slope and side slopes perimeter controls must be installed before land disturbing activity occurs 2 the responsible party shall not disturb the site until the responsible party is ready for construction to proceed 3 efforts to provide cover or stabilize disturbed areas must occur as soon as possible 4 temporary perimeter controls may not be removed until all upstream areas are permanently stabilized e inspection of pollution control measures the responsible party shall inspect all pollution control measures every 14 days and within 24 hours following a rainfall of 05 inches or greater at the site the inspection reports are to be considered part of the operators swp3 and as such are subject to the same record retention schedule and availability requirements of the swp3 the inspection reports as well as the entire swp3 shall be made available for inspection by a representative of the city during normal business hours f maintenance of pollution control measures 1 the responsible party shall maintain and ensure adequate performance of the temporary pollution control measures until permanent pollution control measures are in place 2 whenever the temporary or permanent pollution control measures do not keep soil sediment and debris on the construction site such as excessive tracking of dirt offsite by vehicles and runoff of sediments from the site over sidewalks and into the streets and gutters etc the responsible party shall remove the soil sediment and debris from streets sidewalks inlets or other areas including private property impacted such as determined by the administrator return the soil and sediment to the areas to be stabilized and properly dispose of the debris 3 the responsible party is responsible for the maintenance of any permanent pollution control measures located on the site unless the owner has dedicated the permanent pollution control measure to the city and has provided the city with any easements necessary to allow access to the permanent pollution control measure and to conduct any required maintenance activities    1122016 monitoring of discharges a applicability this section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial and construction

question analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by epa or tceq  3 except as indicated in subparagraph 6 below flow proportional composite collection techniques must be used a each individual grab sample is either combined with the others or analyzed individually and the results averaged in time composite sampling the samples are collected after equal time intervals and combined in proportion to the rate of flow when the sample was collected flow composite sampling can be produced in one of two ways 1 by collecting equal volume individual grab samples after a specific volume of flow passes the sampling point  or 2 by varying the volume of the aliquot collected in proportion to the amount of flow that passed over the time interval that the sample represents composite samples are designed to be representative of the effluent conditions by reflecting the average conditions during the entire sampling period b if flow proportional sampling is infeasible the

cities into districts and regulate the use of property within the districts for the purpose of promotion of the health safety and morals of the public and for the protection of the general welfare of the community b legislative finding number 2 the city council finds that vtca local government et seq authorized home rule cities to promulgate and enforce all ordinances necessary to protect health life and property of the public and to preserve the good government order and security of such cities and their inhabitants c legislative finding number 3 the city council finds that vtca local government et seq where the texas legislature found that the unrestricted operation of certain sexually oriented businesses may be detrimental to the public health safety and welfare by contributing to the decline of residential and business neighborhoods and the growth of criminal activity and provided that does not diminish the authority of a local government to regulate sexually oriented businesses with regard to any matters recognizes the negative secondary effects of such businesses d legislative finding number 4 vtca local government authorized home rule cities to enforce all ordinances necessary to protect health life and property and to preserve the good government order and security of such cities and their inhabitants e legislative finding number 5 the city council finds that studies conducted in other cities and states throughout the country have shown a decline in neighborhoods and neighborhoodoriented commercial religious and institutional facilities when exposed to sexually oriented or adult entertainment businesses as a negative secondary effect and the result would not differ in the city of bryan f legislative finding number 6 the city council finds

districts that are less sensitive to their blighting influences and other negative secondary influences g legislative finding number 7 the city council finds based upon the experiences of the cities in texas and elsewhere in the country that adult entertainment establishments are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual nature h legislative finding number 8 the city council further finds based upon the experiences of the cities in texas and elsewhere in the country that police departments of various communities have made a substantial number of arrests for sexually related crimes in adult entertainment establishments i legislative finding number 9 the city council finds that adult entertainment businesses due to their very nature have serious objectionable operational characteristics thereby contributing to urban blight and downgrading the quality of life in adjacent areas j legislative finding number 10 the city council finds that there is convincing documentary and legislative evidence that sexually oriented businesses or adult entertainment as to be defined under the bryan because of their very nature have deleterious negative secondary effects on both the existing businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them causing increased crime and the consequent downgrading of property values numerous studies reports and findings concerning the harmful effect of adult entertainment uses on surrounding land uses and neighborhoods have been produce before the bryan city council one such example that has been presented to and considered by the city council is the opinion of the fifth circuit for the united states court of appeals in h and a land properties v city of

similar results 74 percent predicted a negative impact on real estate value in the surrounding area 2 amarillo texas in 197 the amarillo planning department prepared a report entitled a report on entertainment uses in amarillo the report concluded that adult entertainment uses have adverse impacts on surrounding land uses and that those impacts can be distinguished from those of other businesses the study found that street crime rates were considerably above the citys average in those areas immediately surrounding the adultonly businesses and that late at night during their primary operating hours those businesses create unique problems of noise glare and traffic 3 indianapolis indiana in 198 indianapolis surveyed real estate experts on the impact that adult entertainment uses had on surrounding property values a random sample 20 percent of the national membership of the american institute of real estate appraisers was used the opinion survey found that an adult bookstore located in the hypothetical neighborhood described would have a negative impact on residential property values of premises located within one block of the site 4 report of the attorney general working group for the regulation of sexually oriented business june 198 that references and analyzes a number of studies on communities across the country for example in 198 the planning department of st paul minnesota completed a study entitled effect of surrounding area of adult entertainment businesses the study concluded that i there was a statistically significant correlation between neighborhood deterioration as reflected in housing values and crime rates and the location of adult entertainment businesses  ii the statistical relationship was still significant after taking into account certain marketing factors  and iii there was a stronger correlation with neighborhood deterioration after establishment of an adult entertainment business than before 5 austin texas in may 198 the austin planning department published a report on adult businesses in austin an analysis of crime rates in austin was conducted by comparing areas with adult businesses to areas without adult businesses four study areas were chosen that did not contain adult businesses two study areas were chosen containing only one adult business each and two study areas were chosen containing two adult businesses each within those study areas containing adult businesses sex crimes were found to be from two to nearly five times the citywide average also sexrelated crime rates were found to be 66 percent higher in study areas containing 2 adult businesses as compared to study areas containing only one adult business austin also conducted a survey of 120 real estate appraisers and lending institutions eightyeight percent of those responding indicated a belief that an adult bookstore would decrease residential property values within one block and 59 percent felt that residential property values would decrease within three blocks a survey of three adult businesses in austin revealed that only three customers had addresses within one mile of an adult business and 44 percent of all customers visiting the three adult businesses had addresses outside the city of austin k legislative finding number 11 the city council is relying on the findings and studies listed above and is attempting to benefit the public welfare by proposing examining and adopting zoning rules definitions and provisions related to adult entertainment 1 it is the express intent of the city council to ensure that the adverse effects created by adult entertainment are minimized and controlled so as not to cause or contribute to crime increased blighting or downgrading of adjacent property and the surrounding neighborhood 2 the regulations established herein are intended to protect and preserve the quality property values integrity and character of the citys neighborhoods and commercial districts deter the spread of urban blights and protect the citizens of the city from the objectionable effects of sexually oriented businesses l legislative finding number 12 the city council finds from the studies that

council finds based on the purposes and legislative findings set out in this ordinance and from the studies noted in legislative finding number 5 that adult entertainment uses should be an allowed use in the i industrial district section 13023 the city council finds that there will be adequate locations for adult entertainment within the city in the area zoned industrial for those uses already permitted in that district and will not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication while minimizing the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment and providing the other purposes
