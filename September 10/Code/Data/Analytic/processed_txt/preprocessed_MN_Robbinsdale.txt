significant and growing portion of the waste in the robbinsdale waste stream regulation of food and beverage packaging therefore is a necessary part of any effort to encourage a recyclable and compostable waste stream thereby reducing the disposal of solid waste and the economic and environmental costs of waste management for the citizens of robbinsdale and others working or doing business in robbinsdale subd 2 the council further finds that plastic packaging is rapidly replacing other packaging material and that most plastic packaging used for foods and beverages is nondegradable nonreturnable and nonrecyclable subd 3 the council also finds that the two main processes used to dispose of discarded nondegradable nonreturnable and nonrecyclable plastic foods and beverage packaging are land filling and incineration both of which should be minimized for environmental reasons subd 4 chemicals hazardous to human health and to the safety of the environment are present in the composition of plastic packaging are believed to leach into the groundwater when this packaging is placed in landfills have been found to escape into the air when this packaging is burned in incinerators and contribute to environmental problems associated with ash residue resulting from the incineration process subd 5 the council therefore finds that the minimization of nondegradable nonreturnable and nonrecyclable food and beverage packaging originating at retail food establishments within the city of robbinsdale is necessary and desirable in order to reduce the citys waste stream so as to reduce the volume of landfilled waste to minimize toxic byproducts of incineration to make the waste stream less damaging to the environment and to make our city and neighboring communities more environmentally sound places to live 60303 definitions subdivision 1 the following terms as used in this section have the meanings given them subd 2 environmentally acceptable

enforce the provisions of this section 60511 added  legislative intent subdivision 1 legislative findings a the council finds that the large volume of waste generated by the telephone directories distributed within the city creates a significant solid waste disposal problem within the city directories are distributed in the city by several companies including us west direct inc gte and sun communications us west direct inc is the primary distributor of directories both residential or white page directories and business or yellow page directories used by the resident and businesses in the city us west direct alone distributes over 950000 phone books throughout the metropolitan area every year without recycling efforts these phone books contribute over four million pounds of paper into the metropolitan areas wastestream putting an added burden on a system that is running out of landfill space b the council further finds that these directories are not currently being recycled and are currently being disposed of by either being placed in landfills or by being incinerated both of these disposal methods rank low on the state of minnesotas list of disposal priorities below reduction reuse and recycling landfill space available to the city is quickly being filled and incineration raises questions of environmental safety including emission into the air of pollutants such as dioxin and other pollutants which are both harmful and annoying robbinsdale city subd 2 rev 1991 c the council finds that the reason telephone directories are not being recycled by the public is not because of a lack of public interest rather it is because the hotglue process used in the bindings of the directories is incompatible with paper recycling programs d the council finds that it is the responsibility of the distributor of directories distributed within the city to either insure the compatibility of the directories with the citys curbside recycling program by using a recyclable animal based water soluble glue in the bindings or to provide for a method of collection and recycling of the directories e lastly the council finds that even though the annual distribution of directories consumes large amounts of paper directories currently contain very little if any recycled content paper the use of recycled content paper reduces environmental strain in that the use of recycled paper and the recycling of used paper products saves 60% of the water required to make virgin paper  reduces water pollution by 15% to 60%  reduces air pollution by 60% to 70%  saves 20% to 70% of the energy needed to produce virgin paper  and saves 17 trees per ton of paper recycled subd 2 legislative purpose a it is the purpose of the city of robbinsdale to reduce the number of telephone directories distributed in the city that are being placed in the municipal waste stream and ultimately incinerated or landfilled the council finds that requiring the distributors of directories to develop and fund collection mechanisms including curbside collection and dropoff sites is a reasonable means to achieve this purpose b further it is also the purpose of the council to reduce the amount of virgin material used to manufacture directories and encourage recycled content in directories distributed in the city the council finds that requiring a set level of recycled content in directories distributed in the city is a reasonable means to achieve this purpose subd 3 for purposes of this subsection the terms defined in this subdivision have the meanings given them a
