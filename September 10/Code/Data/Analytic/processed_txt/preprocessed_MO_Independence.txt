include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error improperly designed treatment facilities inadequate treatment facilities lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation an upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the industrial user demonstrates signed contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that 1 an upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the upset  and 2 the facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures  and 3 the industrial user has submitted the following information to the director within twenty four 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if this information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within five 5 days a a description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance  and b the period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or if not corrected the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue  and c steps being taken andor planned to reduce eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance in any enforcement proceeding the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards the industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided this requirement applies in the situation where among other things the primary source of power of the treatment is reduced lost or fails b an

received within twenty four 24 hours bypass is prohibited and the director may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless 1 bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life personal injury or severe property damage  and 2 there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime this condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass

zoned i1 lowimpact screening would be required to be installed on the developing site since the proposed development is likely to have only limited effect on the abutting property deviations from the standards of this table may be allowed upon approval of the community development department in situations of severe impact the community development department may require additional buffer screening

is required in order to determine the type of soil the plant material is planted in this requires a sharp shooter spade dug 18 inches into the ground fill the hole with water and if after 18 hours the hole still retains the water the soil is determined to be too poor for planting 2 if the soil is determined to be too poor for planting the following two possible remedies are recommended the first remedy is to install a 10foot wide raised planting bed in order to provide acceptable planting soil the height of the bed is the amount of soil it takes to cover the root ball of the plant to a level two inches above the ball the bed must be covered with four inches of mulch to provide for moisture retention a second remedy is to excavate the soil to the depth of the root ball allowing the root ball to rest on the clay soil excavate an area five times the size of the root ball and replace the soil with quality planting soil this must allow the tree roots to spread into adequate soil and provide an established root system before spreading into the poorer soil 1450316 recommended trees and plants 1450316a the following list of plant species has been developed to assist in selecting

follows b findings of fact 1 flood losses resulting from periodic inundation the special flood hazard areas of independence missouri are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base  all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare 2 general causes of the flood losses these flood losses are caused by 1 the cumulative effect of development in any delineated floodplain causing increases in flood heights and velocities  and 2 the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods hazardous to others inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood damages 3 methods used to analyze flood hazards the flood insurance study fis that is the basis of this ordinance uses a standard engineering method of analyzing flood hazards which consist of a series of interrelated steps a selection of a base flood that is based upon engineering calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its expected frequency of occurrence the area inundated and the depth of inundation the base flood selected for this ordinance is representative of large floods which are characteristic of what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this ordinance it is in the general order of a flood which could be expected to have a one percent chance of occurrence in any one year as delineated on the federal insurance administrators fis and illustrative materials for jackson county missouri dated  as amended and any future revisions thereto b calculation of water surface profiles are based on a standard hydraulic engineering analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and overbank areas to convey the regulatory flood c computation of a floodway required to convey this flood without increasing flood heights more than one 1 foot at any point d delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no development is permitted that would cause any increase in flood height e delineation of flood fringe ie that area outside the floodway encroachment lines but still subject to inundation by the base flood c statement of purpose it is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health safety and general welfare  to minimize those losses described in 1  to establish or maintain the communitys eligibility for participation in the national flood insurance program nfip as defined in 44 cfr 5922a3  and to
