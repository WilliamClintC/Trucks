results in loss of life and property health and safety hazards disruption of commerce and governmental services and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief all of which adversely affect the public health safety and general welfare b these flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage app b art i  b statement of purpose it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health safety and general welfare and to minimize public harm and private losses in special flood hazard areas with provisions designed 1 to protect human life and property exposed to the hazards of flooding  2 to ensure that potential property owners are notified if property is in a special flood hazard area  3 to minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public  4 to minimize prolonged business interruptions  5 to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains electric telephone and sewer lines streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas  6 to minimize expenditure of future public money for costly floodcontrol projects  7 to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas app b art i  c methods of reducing flood losses in order to accomplish its purposes this chapter uses the following methods 1 restricts and prohibits uses that are dangerous to health safety or property in times of flood or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities  2 requires that uses vulnerable to floods including public facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction  3 controls in the sense of providing authoritative guidance the alteration of natural floodplains their protective barriers and stream channels  4 prevents the construction of barriers which will divert floodwaters and subject other lands to greater flood hazards  5 controls in the sense of providing authoritative guidance development which would cause greater erosion or potential flood damage such as grading dredging and excavation app b art i  d lands to which chapter applies this chapter shall apply to all

discretion of the editor purpose the emergency alert system eas is the replacement of the emergency broadcast system eas can rapidly disseminate emergency information to the general public at the request of local state and federal officials the local eas may be activated in response to emergency situations such as severe weather floods civil disorders industrial accidents or any occurrence that poses a danger to life or property the purpose of this plan is to explain the system and provide procedures for broadcasters cable operators and emergency managers in the san antonio operational area i 101402 authority a this plan is developed under the authority of title 47 usc 151 154 i and o 303 r 524 g and 606  47 cfr fcc rules and regulations  subpart g of the federal communication

stations television stations low power television lptv stations and wired cable systems with 10000 or more subscribers c effective  eas rules and regulations will also apply to wired or wireless cable systems with 5000 or more subscribers effective  cable systems with less than 5000 subscribers may transmit eas messages on only one channel provided the cable system transmits a video interruption and audio alert message on all channels stating which one channel will carry the complete eas message viii 101402 explanation of eas equipment a eas encoderdecoders all broadcast stations and cable systems with 10000 or more subscribers are required to have an fccapproved eas encoderdecoder the encoderdecoder is capable of transmitting and receiving digitally coded emergency messages each encoderdecoder is assigned to monitor at least two different sources for incoming emergency messages b eas header codes 1 all eas messages must be preceded by a header highspeed digital data identifying the following a the originator of the message national weather service civil authorities national level authorities b the event code identifying the type of emergency examples tornado warnings flood warnings civil emergencies and amber alerts c the area affected by the emergency d the valid time period of the message e date and time the message was issued 2 individual eas decoders can be configured to filter the header code data and activate only for specific emergencies in designated geographical areas detailed information about the format of eas messages is covered in appendix a c modes of operation 1 eas decoders must be capable of at least manual and automatic modes of operation some manufacturers also offer a semiautomatic mode here is a brief explanation of each mode a manual mode the eas decoder will only notify the operator on duty of any incoming eas alert that it is programmed to receive the operator must push a button to transmit the alert on a broadcast station or cable system b automatic mode the eas decoder will automatically interrupt program audio andor video with any incoming eas alerts the decoder is programmed to receive emergency information will be disseminated even if the station or system is not staffed full time c semiautomatic mode when the eas decoder receives an eas alert that it is programmed to respond to it will begin a preset countdown to automatically interrupt if the alert does not air by the time the countdown expires the eas decoder will automatically interrupt the audio andor video with the incoming message 2 eas decoders can be programmed to respond to different alerts in different modes some examples the decoder could respond to all weather watches in manual mode and all weather warnings in automatic mode the decoder could be programmed to respond to the required monthly test rmt in semiautomatic mode since the rmt must be retransmitted within fifteen 15 minutes of receipt the decoder would automatically run the rmt if an operator does not manually respond within the required time limit 3 broadcasters using unattended operation are required to operate their eas decoder in automatic

criteria a guidance for emergency services personnel 1 the emergency alert system is designed for the rapid dissemination of news and official information during emergency situations civil authorities have acquired a valuable tool that provides direct access to area broadcasters and cable operators use of the eas must be reserved for catastrophic situations when time is of the essence to prevent the loss of lives or property 2 the decision to activate the eas rests with emergency services personnel some broadcasters and cable operators will have the eas equipment operating in the automatic mode that pass messages without any prescreening facilities that operate in automatic mode depend on civil authorities to carefully determine if situation warrants eas activation all broadcasters and cable operators participate on a voluntary basis in the locallevel eas broadcasters and cables systems will continue participate in the san antonio local area plan only if there is judicious use of eas activations b definition of an emergency the fcc defines an emergency as a situation posing an extraordinary threat to the safety of life and property the following list is intended for guidance only and is not intended to be an exhaustive list some examples include 1 immediate weather situations tornadoes floods severe thunderstorms high winds icing conditions heavy snows and widespread fires 2 manmade or technological situations nuclear attack or war industrial explosions discharge of toxic or flammable gases release of chemical biological or radioactive agents terrorist attacks widespread power failures civil disorders and dam failures c local activation criteria 1 requests for local activation of the emergency alert system should be limited to an emergency event or situation which a poses an immediate or imminent threat to life or property b has the potential to adversely impact a significant population or geographic area c requires immediate public knowledge to seek shelter or take protective action and other means of disseminating information are inadequate to ensure rapid delivery of the information 2 the media and public should be informed methods for

confidential app c 101402 appendix d  amber plan a background information 1 the purpose of this policy and procedure is to establish the criteria for activating the amber alert by law enforcement when a child is abducted the program is a cooperative public service effort between local law enforcement news media outlets amber plan business partners and the public 2 according to the us justice department up to four thousand six hundred thousand 4600 children are abducted every year nationwide there are another one hundred fourteen thousand six hundred 114600 attempted nonfamily abductions the primary motivation for the child abduction is sexual assault ninety percent of all abducted children are sexually assaulted when an abduction occurs fast action is necessary because sixty percent of the time there is typically a twohour delay in making the initial missing child report seventyfour 74 percent of the abducted children are murdered within three 3 hours of the abduction it is essential for the public to be notified as soon as possible to help find the missing child 3 the san antonio regional amber plan is based on a similar successful program created by the association of radio managers in the dallasfort worth area the program was named after nineyearold amber hagerman who was abducted and murdered in 1996 the dallas amber plan involves thirtythree 33 law enforcement agencies thirty 30 radio stations and 11 television stations in the dallas metroplex 4 since july 199 the dallas amber plan has been activated thirty 30 times  eight 8 children have been safely recovered due to the dallas amber plan since 199 amber plans and similar missing children alerts have expanded to twentyone 21 states in october 200 the national center for missing and exploited children launched an initiative for a nationwide amber plan 5 the san antonio local emergency communications committee lecc administers the san antonio regional amber plan the lecc is appointed by the federal communications commission to develop and implement the emergency alert system eas for a sixteen 16 county region of south texas 6 woaiam 1200 and kkyxam 680 originate and broadcast the eas activation in the san antonio operational area other radio television and cable systems can interrupt their normal programming to voluntarily rebroadcast the eas local activations as a newsweather bulletin or charactergenerated crawl at the top or bottom of the television screen 7 participating media outlets would interrupt their normal programming and broadcast the amber alert at least twice an hour for the first two hours the amber alert message encourages the public to look for the missing child or suspect but take no action themselves instead anyone who thinks they saw the child or suspect should immediately call the law enforcement agency number included in the amber alert once the child is found an amber update would be similarly distributed to law enforcement agencies and media outlets the amber plan subcommittee composed of representatives of participating media outlets and law enforcement agencies will review every amber alert activation within seven days b benefits of easbased amber plan 1 every radiotvcable system will receive the information at the same time 2 no additional expense or reprogramming of eas receiver 3 stations have the option of retransmitting the audio that is received when the eas is activated or information can be revoiced by station personnel 4 with current weekly eas tests control room operators are already aware of the system and use it regularly c activation criteria in order to activate the san antonio amber plan all four of the following items must be met 1 the missing child must be seventeen 17 years of age or younger and police believe the child has been abducted unwillingly taken from their environment without permission from the childs parent or legal guardian 2 police believe the missing child is in danger of serious bodily harm or death 3 a police investigation has taken place that verified the abduction or eliminated alternative explanations 4 sufficient information is available to disseminate to the public that could assist in locating the child suspect andor the suspects vehicle if all four 4 items are not met the amber alert should not be activated d non qualifying situations based on the above criteria the following situations do not qualify for amber plan activation 1 missing child believed to have run away from home 2 missing child taken by a noncustodial relative in a child custody case 3 missing adult age eighteen 18 or older 4 police search for other criminals murder suspect bank robber etc e police procedures upon confirmation of a child abduction 1 determine and prepare information for public distribution the information should be written in clearly understood terms not in police shorthand 2 designate a department contact for the local primary stations include the name and telephone number on the standardized form appendix d1 3 fax the document to the lp1 or lp2 stations 4 the local primary station will immediately call back to the originating department to confirm the information upon confirmation the local primary station will immediately distribute the information to the participating stations and cable systems via the emergency alert system 5 subsequent updates from the originating department should be provided as events warrant 6 upon closure of the child abduction case a final bulletin should be distributed from the local primary station f broadcaster and cable system procedures here is how the ambereas activation procedure works in san antonio 1 fax is received from police agency at woai and kkyx the lp1 and lp2 stations serving the san antonio area both stations communicate with each other upon receipt of amber activation fax to insure that each other has received the information 2 woai and kkyx will activate eas to transmit amber activation the event code is adr all participating broadcast stations in cable systems have programmed their decoders to receive the alerts all broadcast stations and cable systems in the san antonio area monitor woai or kkyx on the eas decoders 3 after transmission of the digital data bursts that trigger your receiver woai and kkyx will transmit the amber tone followed by the text message from the police agency there will be no reference to woai or kkyx in the amber activation 4 following transmission of the message the digital data bursts to terminate the message will be transmitted at that point the audio message from woai or kkyx will be in the eas decoder stations then have an option of either retransmitting the audio or transcribing the message and originating their own broadcast 5 as stated above this procedure gives the receiving stations complete flexibility to either retransmit the audio received with the eas activation or revoice the message with the receiving
